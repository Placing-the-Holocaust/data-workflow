<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="59">Q: Was it hard for your mother that you, that you and your brothers weren't being raised more religious? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="61">A: I think so. </sentence><sentence id="62">I think it was hard for her and this is why she asked us, the day she's going to die, she wants to be buried with the Jewish religion, which we did. </sentence><sentence id="63">At the time, I did have an <span class="building">office</span> in south of <span class="country">France</span>, close to <span class="populated place">Nice</span>. </sentence><sentence id="64">And when she died, we made... the rabbi did the whole thing. </sentence><sentence id="65">We didn't understand anything about it, because it was the first Jewish funeral we did. </sentence><sentence id="66">But here she is in south of <span class="country">France</span>, in a <span class="populated place">Jewish place</span>, where she was buried like the Jewish religion. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="73">Q: Do you remember... I assume you, were you going to a <span class="building">public school</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="75">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="77">Q: Do you remember when the Germans occupied <span class="country">France</span>? </sentence><sentence id="78">Do you remember them coming in? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="81">A: In <span class="country">France</span>? </sentence><sentence id="82">They came very, not in force. </sentence><sentence id="83">They came very, very slowly. </sentence><sentence id="84">The reason, I think, they got the whole thing so easy is because the French people are very anti-Semitic. </sentence><sentence id="85">So, for them 3 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="86">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="87"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0002 4 to give the address or to reveal where the Jew were living, it was not a problem. </sentence><sentence id="88">And I don't mean to say all of them, because a lot of police... we did have a neighbor, across from our <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, who was from the police. </sentence><sentence id="89">And I even remember his name. </sentence><sentence id="90">His name was Mr.Reddler (ph). </sentence><sentence id="91">And every time something did happen, he came in our <span class="dlf">door</span>, knock on the <span class="dlf">door</span> and said, "Be careful. </sentence><sentence id="92">They're going to do this, they're going to do this." </sentence><sentence id="93">So, I don't mean to say all the Frenchmen, but I said at least the majority of the French people were anti-Semitic. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="111">Q: Did you have any sense, up to that point, of being a Jew? </sentence><sentence id="112">Had you personally experienced any anti-Semitism? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="115">A: All the time, even when I was a little boy I took the <span class="spatial object">subway</span> in <span class="populated place">Paris</span> and you can see on the <span class="dlf">wall</span>, Jew equal <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>, Jew go <span class="building">home</span>, things like this. </sentence><sentence id="116">Yes, you couldn't do otherwise than to realize, okay, we are not welcome in our own <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="117">When I say our own <span class="country">country</span>, I'm born in <span class="country">France</span>, so I thought I was a Frenchman, which was a big mistake, because no. </sentence><sentence id="118">I was a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="119">It's a little bit the same problem and I don't want to start any... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="125">Q: It's okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="127">A: It's the, my feeling... I speak with a lot of black people here and I ask them why do you call yourself, African-American? </sentence><sentence id="128">I don't say to people, Iam a French-American. </sentence><sentence id="129">I'm an American, because I asked to become an American. </sentence><sentence id="130">If I would call myself French-American, it would mean to say, I'm very happy to be French and I'm also happy to be an American. </sentence><sentence id="131">And I think in life, you have to make a choice, either you are an American or you're French. </sentence><sentence id="132">And if it wouldn't be... I say this the other day to a black guy. </sentence><sentence id="133">He was very surprised. </sentence><sentence id="134">And coming from me, I think it was not a big problem. </sentence><sentence id="135">But I said, "I think you're very lucky, your grand-grandparent was brought in <span class="region">United State</span>. </sentence><sentence id="136">At least now you can drive a <span class="spatial object">car</span>. </sentence><sentence id="137">You can have a nice <span class="building">home</span>, instead of being in <span class="country">Africa</span> where you'd be starving. </sentence><sentence id="138">You wouldn't have any clothes to put on your back and anybody can kill you. </sentence><sentence id="139">And this for me is racism. </sentence><sentence id="140">Here racism is not this. </sentence><sentence id="141">They are not racist, so I don't understand why you call yourself African-American. </sentence><sentence id="142">You are American from two, three or four generations. </sentence><sentence id="143">And it's not because your parents were slave." </sentence><sentence id="144">And when you know the story about the slave, it's not the American who took the black people. </sentence><sentence id="145">It's the chief of the <span class="populated place">village</span>, who give black people to the American. </sentence><sentence id="146">So... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="167">Q: What kind of response did you get? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="169">A: Most of the time they said, "Well it's a way of things. </sentence><sentence id="170">You have a different way of speaking." </sentence><sentence id="171">And I said, "You know, I, as a Jewish person cannot be a racist. </sentence><sentence id="172">So, if I tell you this, it's because coming from another <span class="country">country</span>, I'm surprised the way you deal with your slave story. </sentence><sentence id="173">You feel sorry for yourself, but you're so lucky to be in a <span class="country">country</span> where you have freedom and you can live like any other person. </sentence><sentence id="174">You're Black? </sentence><sentence id="175">Sure it's, you can see a black man, but sometimes you can recognize a Jewish boy and so it's nothing worse to be Black or to be Jew, but I don't want to fight the <span class="country">country</span> for this." </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="183">Q: You don't think that Jews can be racist, too? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="185"> 4 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="186">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="187"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0002 5 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="188">A: Oh, yes. </sentence><sentence id="189">Oh yeah, oh yeah, Jewish people can be very, very racist. </sentence><sentence id="190">And I saw this on many different occasion. </sentence><sentence id="191">But it's not the same kind of racism they have. </sentence><sentence id="192">It's a... I don't know any Jew belonging to the KKK. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="198">Q: They wouldn't probably accept them. [ </sentence><sentence id="199">Laughing] </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="202">A: Absolutely, so I don't think... but it's, it make a... Man is man, woman is woman, people are people. </sentence><sentence id="203">And you can find people, different idea of people, different approach of life and so I think, yes, it can be a lot of, some Jewish people can be racist. </sentence><sentence id="204">It doesn't make a... but before we have to define: what do they mean by being racist? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="208">Q: What do you think that means? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="210">A: Well, racism is something, it's hate with no reason. </sentence><sentence id="211">You like some people, you like some people living in this <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="212">You like some people living in another <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="213">You don't like people the way they live, this can be racism. </sentence><sentence id="214">But basically, it's not racism, it's something, because you don't like their way of laughing. </sentence><sentence id="215">Black people are very exuberant and maybe some American don't like this and this can be a form of racism. </sentence><sentence id="216">And like I said before, Jewish people living in <span class="country">America</span> are much more American than they are Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="217">And because of this, they can be racist. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="226">Q: I don't understand that last. </sentence><sentence id="227">Because they're Jewish people living in <span class="country">America</span>, they can be racist. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="230">A: Because they feel very safe in this <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="231">And like I told you before, Jewish people are Jewish by tradition, but they belong to a minority. </sentence><sentence id="232">And if you are in <span class="country">France</span> or in United State or any <span class="country">country</span> in the world, you still are minority. </sentence><sentence id="233">But it is so comfortable in <span class="country">United State</span>, then Jewish people forget the background and say, "But I'm an American." </sentence><sentence id="234">And I say, "No, first you are Jew, and if anybody is going to kill you, they're going to kill you, just because you are Jew, not because you're an American." </sentence><sentence id="235">And this is the big problem and they lose the identity of being Jewish, just because they feel so comfortable. </sentence><sentence id="236">They feel, /t's my <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="237">Yes it is, in one way. </sentence><sentence id="238">But until, and you can see this on TV, this young man, who been speaking about racism against black, Jew, all the Jew have the power in the <span class="building">bank</span>. </sentence><sentence id="239">It's not true, but in his mind it is. </sentence><sentence id="240">And he killed people and he killed himself. </sentence><sentence id="241">You saw this on TV two or three days ago. </sentence><sentence id="242">This is the big problem. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="256">Q: Let's go back a little bit to, you were just telling me before about your experience as a child in <span class="populated place">Paris</span> and the anti-Semitism that you experienced. </sentence><sentence id="257">Did you have, were all of your friends Jewish at the time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="260">A: At the time I didn't have a lot of friends, because I was, I did a big selection. </sentence><sentence id="261">I'm not the kind of man who have a lot of friends. </sentence><sentence id="262">And yes, at the time all my friends, at the time were Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="263">The reason is, I feel more comfortable with Jewish people than with non-Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="264">And again, I don't speak about religion. </sentence><sentence id="265">I speak about tradition. </sentence><sentence id="266">Going to a <span class="building">Jewish restaurant</span> once in a while, it's fun and it remind me memory. </sentence><sentence id="267">Watching a movie with Jewish song, it's fun. </sentence><sentence id="268">I've been married twice with non-Jewish woman and I was missing this exchange of jokes, Jewish jokes or word. </sentence><sentence id="269">Even in <span class="populated place">New York</span>, when I go to <span class="populated place">New York</span>, people speak a lot of Jewish word and it's always funny. </sentence><sentence id="270">And I always say, "Are you Jewish?" " </sentence><sentence id="271">No, but we use a lot of Jewish word here 5 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="272">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="273"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0002 6 in <span class="populated place">New York</span>," but they are not Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="274">But it's funny, I like it, because it's something... So when I was in <span class="country">France</span>, I didn't want to have non-Jewish friend because I would never know if the same guy is not going to give me a knife when the time comes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="291">Q: You really felt that at a very early age? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="293">A: Oh yes, oh yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="295">Q: Did you... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="297">A: Well, my brother came back from the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="298">The only reason I left <span class="country">France</span> to come in the <span class="country">United State</span>, I decided to come here in 1983, is because I didn't feel comfortable in <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="299">Because up to this date, you have this anti-Semitism in <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="300">My brother, who is seventy-six or seventy-eight, doesn't feel it. </sentence><sentence id="301">He said, "No, this is in your mind." </sentence><sentence id="302">And he is married with a non-Jew woman. </sentence><sentence id="303">She is wonderful woman, but I don't feel comfortable. </sentence><sentence id="304">I...<span class="country">France</span> is a beautiful country. </sentence><sentence id="305">I like to go on vacation, but I couldn't live there anymore, because of all this background. </sentence><sentence id="306">I've never been comfortable in <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="318">Q: Did your family speak Yiddish at <span class="building">home</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="320">A: Yes, all the time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="322">Q: Do you still speak Yiddish? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="324">A: Yes, uh huh. </sentence><sentence id="325">I don't find a lot of people I can speak Yiddish with, because most of the Jewish people here, don't speak Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="326">But my grandson, which is the son of my daughter, and my daughter doesn't follow the religion. </sentence><sentence id="327">But my grandson studied the Jewish story, I mean the difference between Sepharad and Ashkenazi and he said, "But sometime they are racist between..." And I said, "Yes, I know." </sentence><sentence id="328">I think if you put two men with no religion on an <span class="env feature">island</span>, there's going to be racism, because man is stupid. </sentence><sentence id="329">They want to fight. </sentence><sentence id="330">They want to fight for a reason. </sentence><sentence id="331">The reason is religion. </sentence><sentence id="332">And they are going to fight about God, it's my God, it's not your God. </sentence><sentence id="333">God is God. </sentence><sentence id="334">Your God is my God. </sentence><sentence id="335">There is only one God. </sentence><sentence id="336">But we don't want this, this way. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="350">Q: Going back to <span class="populated place">Paris</span>, you were talking a little bit earlier about the time when your two brothers were called in and they were deported. </sentence><sentence id="351">Do you remember around when that was? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="354">A: It was March in 1942, when they did go to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="355">Before it was a <span class="populated place">camp</span> a little bit outside of <span class="populated place">Paris</span> called <span class="populated place">Drancy</span>, where all the Jewish people been put together for a length of time, I think it was between eight and ten month. </sentence><sentence id="356">Where they start to shape the whole thing: "Are we going to send them? </sentence><sentence id="357">What kind of <span class="spatial object">train</span> are we going to use?" </sentence><sentence id="358">It was another <span class="populated place">camp</span> not far from there, called <span class="populated place">Compiegne</span>, which was also the same kind. </sentence><sentence id="359">So... there is a man, who came here in <span class="populated place">Lexington</span>, a Jewish man, who gave something... I've got something, I will remember his name. </sentence><sentence id="360">And he explained what the German did have in mind. </sentence><sentence id="361">And it's amazing the way they did organize the whole thing. </sentence><sentence id="362">Even it was a lot of Jewish people, put together in a <span class="spatial object">train</span>, they didn't know nothing, from where they come, what they going to do, where they going to go. </sentence><sentence id="363">6 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="364">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="365"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0002 7 Everything was real on paper. </sentence><sentence id="366">The <span class="building">train company</span> didn't know what they were going to transport, because it was special <span class="spatial object">train</span> for animals. </sentence><sentence id="367">So, it was so well organized, and they prepared all this and from each <span class="country">country</span> it was the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="368">From <span class="country">Poland</span> it was another way. </sentence><sentence id="369">From <span class="country">Yugoslavia</span> it was another way. </sentence><sentence id="370">From <span class="country">Austria</span> it was another way. </sentence><sentence id="371">It was really a technique they did have. </sentence><sentence id="372">And the top of those guys, I'm afraid to say he was a brain, because he was crazy. </sentence><sentence id="373">But his name was Himmler, and he organized the whole thing. </sentence><sentence id="374">And he organized this very well. </sentence><sentence id="375">And you know, the Jewish people who've been in <span class="populated place">camp</span>, most of them were, what we call here blue-collar, simple people. </sentence><sentence id="376">They didn't think we're going to kill them. </sentence><sentence id="377">Even until they arrive in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, when they say, the SS was on, say, one side, "You go this way, you go this way." </sentence><sentence id="378">No, it was nothing. </sentence><sentence id="379">The only time my brother realized he was in a bad direction is when one time, coming down from the <span class="spatial object">train</span>, he didn't go fast enough. </sentence><sentence id="380">The SS slapped his face. </sentence><sentence id="381">And he was nineteen years old. </sentence><sentence id="382">Then he realized something is going to happen, now it's another world. </sentence><sentence id="383">But until then, well it was hard, they didn't have anything to eat in the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="384">They didn't have any <span class="env feature">water</span>. </sentence><sentence id="385">They didn't have any... but it's going to clear up, no problem. </sentence><sentence id="386">They didn't realize they go to the <span class="building">butcher</span>. </sentence><sentence id="387">They go to die, by thousands. </sentence><sentence id="388">And this was the life. </sentence><sentence id="389">They did go, because the only one who realize what's going on were the educated people, the attorney, the doctor, the people who did study. </sentence><sentence id="390">But they were not many people. </sentence><sentence id="391">When my brother was deported in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, it was a guy with him, who was, I think he was a colonel in the French army. </sentence><sentence id="392">And he said, "They are going to do nothing to me. </sentence><sentence id="393">I'm a colonel from the French army." </sentence><sentence id="394">He died like all the one, just because he was Jew. </sentence><sentence id="395">That's all. </sentence><sentence id="396">They didn't care he was a colonel. </sentence><sentence id="397">He did have a high education. </sentence><sentence id="398">Doesn't make any difference. </sentence><sentence id="399">You are Jew, you must die. </sentence><sentence id="400">It's amazing, eh? </sentence><sentence id="401">But... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="453">A: Yes, we did have the possibility to go around the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, Private Honor (ph) from <span class="building">Haus</span> (ph) let us in and we could communicate by sign. </sentence><sentence id="454">So we can see they are alive, because in <span class="populated place">Drancy</span> they didn't kill anybody. </sentence><sentence id="455">They been starving. </sentence><sentence id="456">They even allowed to receive some package of food. </sentence><sentence id="457">But like I said, it was not a long time, but communicate mouth to mouth? </sentence><sentence id="458">No, it was impossible. </sentence><sentence id="459">No German in <span class="populated place">Drancy</span> just the French military and the police. </sentence><sentence id="460">No SS, no German, the whole <span class="populated place">camp</span> was under the surveillance of the French police. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2612">Q: Okay, this is an interview with Dr. Paul Pressman, a continuation. </sentence><sentence id="2613">It's now August 17", 1999, continuing our interview from July. </sentence><sentence id="2614">And this is tape number three, side A. I wondered when I was looking over the notes. </sentence><sentence id="2615">I took some, listened to the interview that we did last time and I took some notes on things that we had talked about, and one thing which stood out, that I didn't ask you about was, I wondered how you felt... you were talking about your mother's role in the resistance and discovering that she was actually a fighter or a captain in the resistance movement and that she showed you this gun that she kept hidden in this book. </sentence><sentence id="2616">And I wondered how that effected your view of your mother and how, whether that moment was significant to you in some way? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2622">A: Not specifically, because I think I knew my mother since a long time, since I was very little, I mean when I was eight, nine years old, we did have very serious question to ask to each other. </sentence><sentence id="2623">And I think basically we didn't, I didn't have, she didn't have any secret from me, so I was not surprised and not shocked to see what she was doing. </sentence><sentence id="2624">And she was doing this very naturally. </sentence><sentence id="2625">I mean, she didn't show off. </sentence><sentence id="2626">It was what she was doing and that's all. </sentence><sentence id="2627">But it was not something...a big surprise for me. </sentence><sentence id="2628">I never been afraid of gun. </sentence><sentence id="2629">I never been excited over gun, but I understood. </sentence><sentence id="2630">The question... it was no question in my mind. </sentence><sentence id="2631">It was a normal way of life, knowing what she was doing before. </sentence><sentence id="2632">And it was, to me, a normal situation. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2645">Q: Knowing what she was doing before, meaning that...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2647">A: Before she used to go, at the time when she was in <span class="populated place">Grenoble</span>, in south of <span class="country">France</span>, she used to go and bring food, letter, visit French Resistance in the <span class="building">hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2648">And those people were guarded by German. </sentence><sentence id="2649">And she always found a way to go in, bring what she did have to bring. </sentence><sentence id="2650">She did a lot of risky things, but the natural way. </sentence><sentence id="2651">So, knowing this, after this, knowing she was carrying a gun, didn't surprise me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2657">Q: The reason that I noticed it and that I asked you about it, one reason was that the gun, the issue of your experiences with a gun came up a couple of times during the interview yesterday. </sentence><sentence id="2658">You talked about the one time that, or not yesterday but earlier, you talked about the one time Pastor Lederman got angry at you was when he saw you playing with his gun. </sentence><sentence id="2659">And then you talked about that other incident with your mother. </sentence><sentence id="2660">And then you mentioned also that you feel safer if you have a gun now. </sentence><sentence id="2661">And that was something you didn't talk about on tape. </sentence><sentence id="2662">And I was wondering if you would talk about that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2669">A: Well, it took me a long time before I could train myself. </sentence><sentence id="2670">I have now thirty year of martial art behind me. </sentence><sentence id="2671">I always felt in general, the Jewish people don't like gun, don't like to fight. </sentence><sentence id="2672">I mean I speak about the Jewish people in <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2673">And it was a discovery for, I think, every Jewish people in the world when we found out Israelian soldier were one of the best in the world. </sentence><sentence id="2674">And I was not surprised, I was happy about, but generally, even up to this date, when you speak gun with Jewish people they don't like it. </sentence><sentence id="2675">Jewish people in general are not fighter, unless you go in <span class="country">Israel</span> and they did what they did. </sentence><sentence id="2676">And this is why I always felt very secure, and when I was with my godfather in <span class="country">Switzerland</span>, I did like to have this gun close to me. </sentence><sentence id="2677">But it was very hard for me to explain to him why. </sentence><sentence id="2678">I always felt like if anything happened, maybe I'm going to die, but I'm 29 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="2679">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="2680"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0002 30 going to defend myself. </sentence><sentence id="2681">I don't want to die like a poor animal. </sentence><sentence id="2682">I want to die, but before I'm going to die, somebody else is going to die, too. </sentence><sentence id="2683">It was my feeling since a long time. </sentence><sentence id="2684">I was in very big contradiction with my brothers, but something I have to say... even I knew my father very little, my father used to carry all the time a gun. </sentence><sentence id="2685">I didn't know why and I couldn't ask the question, because I don't think he would answer, but this is something I remember. </sentence><sentence id="2686">And maybe it's because of this I always... But basically in my mind I think the reason I always like gun is because gun, you can defend yourself, without a gun, you dead. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2707">Q: Did your father carry a gun before the war, too? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2709">A: Yeah, absolutely, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2711">Q: So that meant when you saw your mother with a gun it wasn't so unusual, because you had already seen your father with a gun and it was something you were used to having around. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2713">A: Exactly. </sentence><sentence id="2714">Because my mother never touch gun before. </sentence><sentence id="2715">I never saw, before the war, my mother with a gun. </sentence><sentence id="2716">But when I saw her with a gun, it makes sense to me. </sentence><sentence id="2717">From where we come... it's funny because we were four, five brother and we were so different. </sentence><sentence id="2718">The only one I know the best is the one who stay alive now. </sentence><sentence id="2719">And he is so different, like I said in the tape before and he's not a fighter. </sentence><sentence id="2720">He's a good man. </sentence><sentence id="2721">He's not a fighter, and the only reason he came back is because he was lucky. </sentence><sentence id="2722">And you can... you know, in front of so many SS or Nazi in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, you don't have a... if they decide to kill you, they will kill you anytime they want. </sentence><sentence id="2723">So when he came back, he came back because he was lucky. </sentence><sentence id="2724">But my brother was not a fighter and I am a fighter. </sentence><sentence id="2725">Like I told him many time, if I was in a <span class="populated place">camp</span>, if they took me in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, I wouldn't survive an hour. </sentence><sentence id="2726">They would kill me right away. </sentence><sentence id="2727">But the same idea, they would kill me, but I would kill somebody before I die. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2743">Q: Do you ever feel critical of those who didn't struggle enough? </sentence><sentence id="2744">There's been a lot a criticism of Jews during the Holocaust, that they didn't struggle enough. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2747">A: Well, it's always... was bad feeling for me, to see, like when in <span class="populated place">Paris</span> they put together all the Jew in one big <span class="dlf">field</span>, closed completely. </sentence><sentence id="2748">It was hard for me later, to understand why they didn't do something. </sentence><sentence id="2749">Why didn't they organize? </sentence><sentence id="2750">The only time they organized themselves and most of them time it was Polish Jew, it was in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> of <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2751">This is where they organize, they fight, because they say die for die. </sentence><sentence id="2752">We going to fight. </sentence><sentence id="2753">But in <span class="country">France</span>, no, because again we come back to the same idea, all the Jewish people from <span class="country">France</span> said, "I'm not Jewish, I'm French, Jewish is my religion," which was true on the basic. </sentence><sentence id="2754">But the German said, "No, you Jew. </sentence><sentence id="2755">French Jew, German Jew, Italian Jew, you are Jew, you have to die." </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2765">Q: And along those lines, you also mentioned last time that before the war and maybe during the war too, you thought of yourself that way, as a French person and then as a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="2766">And I'm wondering when that switched that you really felt like, no I'm not French, I'm Jewish? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2769">A: Well, everything changed when I saw they arrest everybody, young, old people. </sentence><sentence id="2770">And they arrest them just because they were Jew. </sentence><sentence id="2771">And to me it didn't make any sense. </sentence><sentence id="2772">This is when I start to realize, I'm not French, I'm not American, I'm not Russian, I'm Jew. </sentence><sentence id="2773">This is the only reason.30 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="2774">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="2775"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0002 31 I'm born Jew, so they want to kill me, that's all. </sentence><sentence id="2776">Like I told you before, look up to this day, what happened last week. </sentence><sentence id="2777">This guy, who did go in <span class="region">California</span> and kill Jew just because he doesn't like Jew. </sentence><sentence id="2778">And this is when I said to the American Jew, maybe you are an American, but before everything you are Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="2779">And they are going to kill you, not because you are an American, because you are Jew. </sentence></p></dialogue>
