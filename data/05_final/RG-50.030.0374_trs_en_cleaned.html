id="899">I was a nurse, a student nurse in that <span class="building">hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="900">My fiance was a medical student, and her boyfriend was a medical student, all in that same <span class="building">university</span>. </sentence><sentence id="901">And all my classmates were ready to help, everybody helped us there. </sentence><sentence id="902">First, when I was accepted in that <span class="building">school</span>, nobody -- when I told them, you know, I'm Jewish, they said, "Who cares? </sentence><sentence id="903">That has no meaning for us." </sentence><sentence id="904">You know, the French administration, the directors of the <span class="building">school</span>, the picture I showed you earlier of my classmates, the directors of the <span class="building">school</span> and our instructor in that picture, too. </sentence><sentence id="905">And they said, "We couldn't care less. </sentence><sentence id="906">You are French person. </sentence><sentence id="907">You want to come in <span class="building">nursing school</span>, you come in <span class="building">nursing school</span>." </sentence><sentence id="908">And they accepted me, and I was protected there. </sentence><sentence id="909">When Germans came to arrest patients, it was Catholic nuns who directed the <span class="spatial object">transport</span>. </sentence><sentence id="910">The <span class="building">school</span> was a <span class="building">Red Cross school</span>, which was separate. </sentence><sentence id="911">But we all, you know, did all our work, practical work in the <span class="building">hospital</span>, and the <span class="building">hospital</span> of the <span class="building">university</span> was by then at that time completely run by the Catholic nuns. </sentence><sentence id="912">And the Catholic nuns would be warned if the Germans were arriving and they hid me, so that they don't see me. </sentence><sentence id="913">Because the director of the <span class="building">hospital</span> said to me, "You are not going to wear the yellow star in the <span class="building">hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="914">I don't want to see it." </sentence><sentence id="915">And I didn't wear it, but they knew that they would arrest me because I don't wear it. </sentence><sentence id="916">That was already the best punishment, just for that. </sentence><sentence id="917">So they hid me every time that the Germans came to arrest people, take them to the <span class="building">stations</span> in the <span class="building">barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="918">You know, old people, young people, whatever they -- whoever they wanted, not just Jews but whoever they felt they should arrest. </sentence><sentence id="919">It was enough that somebody tell them it's a Communist, even if it was absolutely not true, then they would arrest. </sentence><sentence id="920">But my sister then she -- we had arranged, I had seen one of the doctors at the <span class="building">hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="921">And we had arranged that she wasn't feeling well, she had a kidney problem, a serious kidney problem and he knew that. </sentence><sentence id="922">So I had discussed that with him, and he agreed that if she is coming to the <span class="building">hospital</span> the morning we were escaping, then he would treat -- the <span class="building">hospital</span> and then he didn't know anything else, but all my classmates, her boyfriend -- my fiance said -- as soon

class="building">hospital</span>, and he said to them, "Nobody goes to the <span class="building">hospital</span>." </sentence><sentence id="928">That was a combination, because after that they knew we had gone, so then she had no more chance. </sentence><sentence id="929">So that was it. </sentence><sentence id="930">So from the camp of <span class="populated place">Poitiers</span>, she was later sent to <span class="populated place">Drancy</span>, and from <span class="populated place">Drancy</span> she was sent to <span class="populated place">Pithiviers</span>, which is between <span class="populated place">Paris</span> and <span class="populated place">Orleans</span>. </sentence><sentence id="931">And from <span class="populated place">Pithiviers</span>, she was deported on the day of Yom Kippur, 8-42 to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="932">And we know she went to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> because I have the book saying that her <span class="spatial object">convoy</span> went to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> in three days. </sentence><sentence id="933">And we got cards; after the war was finished, her boyfriend had received a card that she had smuggled out on the day of Yom Kippur. </sentence><sentence id="934">It was a nurse of the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, and the card said she couldn't write to us. </sentence><sentence id="935">But she wrote to him, and he was in <span class="populated place">Poitiers</span>. </sentence><sentence id="936">And she -- which isn't very far from <span class="populated place">Pithiviers</span>, and that card -- he gave me that card when he met me after the war. </sentence><sentence id="937">And in that card, she told that they are leaving, the morale excellent. </sentence><sentence id="938">They prayed and fasted all day on Yom Kippur; they didn't know how much fasting they would do afterwards. </sentence><sentence id="939">And she was deported that day. </sentence><sentence id="940">She wrote to us that she would try by all means, we had the code to make little points on those certain letters. </sentence><sentence id="941">The Germans, if they had found the card with that, would have absolutely known what the code means. </sentence><sentence id="942">They would have broken the code in no time, but she wrote, "I will sabotage my work as much as I can." </sentence><sentence id="943">She didn't realize, we didn't know what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="944">It was unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="945">But anyway, she was deported, but in between we decided to leave so that she can escape. </sentence><sentence id="946">And because that things were getting worse and worse, so we knew it was time. </sentence><sentence id="947">It was right after I was a graduate of the first year of nursing, and all my classmates helped. </sentence><sentence id="948">Everybody helped. </sentence><sentence id="949">My fiance helped. </sentence><sentence id="950">The neighbors helped, they came and took our belongings out of the <span class="building">house</span> with their

they all would give us back everything we left. </sentence><sentence id="953">You know, all that was risking their lives, and the night before we left -- oh, I have first to talk about something else. </sentence><sentence id="954">Several weeks earlier, a man I had worked with at the <span class="building">city hall</span>, I knew him but not very much. </sentence><sentence id="955">His name is

identity cards had the stamp Jew. </sentence><sentence id="961">So he said, "I have to" -- "I can give you cards for everybody in your family." </sentence><sentence id="962">And I asked him how much it would cost, and his response was to say, "How can you ask me how much it can cost? </sentence><sentence id="963">Such a thing, you don't pay for. </sentence><sentence id="964">I do it because that's what I believe in." </sentence><sentence id="965">And he was a poor man, he was not a rich man at all at that time. </sentence><sentence id="966">And he did it, he gave us cards and that's why we could escape. </sentence><sentence id="967">Because as long we had the Jew stamped, we could not walk anywhere, couldn't go out of the <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="968">So he saved the life of my whole family, and for -- he didn't -- but I have to say that. </sentence><sentence id="969">I forgot. </sentence><sentence id="970">That Mr. Charpentier since he was very young had worked for one of the three or four Jewish families who lived in <span class="populated place">Poitiers</span> for a long time and had a <span

he did cards for them, too. </sentence><sentence id="975">Never asked, but the Forshan, I'll never forget what they did for me and my family and what I can do for Jews, you're all French and I will do that for you peoples. </sentence><sentence id="976">I want you to be safe. </sentence><sentence id="977">I cannot accept that that will be. </sentence><sentence id="978">And that's what we heard. </sentence><sentence id="979">You know, when we walked in the <span class="dlf">street</span> when we start to wear the star, old men -- very proper old men, you know, because they used to love the little nobility in <span class="populated place">Poitiers</span>. </sentence><sentence id="980">I told you it's a very backwoods <span class="country">country</span>, very right wing.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3920">A: One point I wanted to make is that always the German afterwards, after we won the war, always pretended that they did not know, and that's absolutely not true. </sentence><sentence id="3921">They knew it because the soldiers came <span class="building">home</span> and they told the story. </sentence><sentence id="3922">They told about all these barbaric things. </sentence><sentence id="3923">I head it, | was there only three weeks and I heard it. </sentence><sentence id="3924">And how could the people who lived there all the time not hear it? </sentence><sentence id="3925">And I didn't know the people who told me then. </sentence><sentence id="3926">So they boasted about it openly, so that's a big myth that's the Germans did not know. </sentence><sentence id="3927">And I have friends who were in a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>, a young Alsatian, who was later in our <span class="building">unit</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3928">And he said -- he was in <span class="populated place">Dachau</span> or <span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span>, I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="3929">And he said that when they were taken out on walks to go to the <span class="building">work site</span> every day, there were skeletons, all these people. </sentence><sentence id="3930">And there were barely walking, and people in the <span class="populated place">town</span> would throw stones at them and beat them. </sentence><sentence id="3931">On top of -- do you know, all the other brutalities? </sentence><sentence id="3932">So these were <span class="populated place">town</span> people, and they all said, "Oh, we did not know." </sentence><sentence id="3933">You know, one German one day recognized what the Germans did to me, and I shook his hand. </sentence><sentence id="3934">I said, "You are the only honest German I ever met." </sentence><sentence id="3935">It was unbelievable that they absolutely denied the horrible things they all knew they had done. </sentence><sentence id="3936">It was no secret. </sentence><sentence id="3937">It was impossible to have a secret. </sentence><sentence id="3938">So I think that point is very important. </sentence><sentence id="3939">Okay, now I go back to my story. </sentence><sentence id="3940">I don't know where I am. </sentence></p></dialogue>

down, I need to talk to you." </sentence><sentence id="3984">And I took him aside and I told him, "I am here. </sentence><sentence id="3985">I am part of the Army. </sentence><sentence id="3986">I'm in the intelligence. </sentence><sentence id="3987">I need to see -- to be taken to the <span class="building">headquarters</span> right now. </sentence><sentence id="3988">I need to go there because

who to contact, how to contact and then ended story and I was okay. </sentence><sentence id="3995">So I told him the important information I had. </sentence><sentence id="3996">That day, I had gone back to <span class="dlf">Siegfried line</span> to see my good friend, the little SS, who had invited me to come because I want to see what's going at that <span class="dlf">Siegfried line</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3997">And when | arrived at the <span class="dlf">Siegfried line</span> and I inquired about him, they were all leaving. </sentence><sentence id="3998">The <span class="dlf">Siegfried line</span> was emptying, the French came down, not south but west -- no, east of the <span class="dlf">Siegfried line</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3999">They did not want to deal with the <span class="dlf">Siegfried line</span>, but my information was the <span class="dlf">Siegfried line</span> was empty, not to worry about it. </sentence><sentence id="4000">So that was extremely important military information right then and there. </sentence><sentence id="4001">So Colonel Petit believed me and he sent out, you know, patrols and they found out that the <span class="dlf">Siegfried line</span> was empty. </sentence><sentence id="4002">So after that, he really believed me. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="4003">And I was very well treated, and he said to me, "Do you want me to send you back to your <span class="spatial object">unit</span>? </sentence></p><p><sentence id="4004">I know where they are located." </sentence><sentence id="4005">He had gotten in

id="4007">I have to go back <span class="region">south</span>." </sentence><sentence id="4008">Because they were coming not <span class="region">south</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4009">The <span

quite high. </sentence><sentence id="4026">And at one point, I was just pushing my <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span>, I couldn't ride it. </sentence><sentence id="4027">It was much too incline, steep. </sentence><sentence id="4028">So a German soldier was walking there. </sentence><sentence id="4029">There were always soldiers all over walking, they didn't know where to go because they didn't know where their <span class="building">units</span> were. </sentence><sentence id="4030">They were completely disorganized by then. </sentence><sentence id="4031">So he said to me, "I

talked and I always talked to them that I was looking for that fiance who was lost, do you know that? </sentence><sentence id="4036">I didn't know where he was. </sentence><sentence id="4037">I always used that, and I told him that I had run away. </sentence><sentence id="4038">And I told that everybody when I got out of <span class="populated place">Freiburg</span>, when I went <span

that they have black soldiers and a lot of them and they look terrible? </sentence><sentence id="4040">And they're barbaric, I made a big story. </sentence><sentence id="4041">They were all terrified, you know, because they had not more organization. </sentence><sentence id="4042">They were not structured anymore, they had no real defense. </sentence><sentence id="4043">And they were not going to get killed for nothing, so the best thing was to do that and I did a good job at that. </sentence><sentence id="4044">And I told them -- and then I went south toward the <span class="dlf">border</span> because there I had a family I wanted go to see just near the <span class="dlf">Swiss border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4045">But that was the brother-in-law of the

</sentence><sentence id="4047">They wouldn't even know, they knew already that I was going to come. </sentence><sentence id="4048">So they knew all about me, and they knew that I was from the French

German. </sentence><sentence id="4063">And then, I knew that it was imperative to go to that <span class="building">house</span> of the Swiss and to get that information to my partner as fast as possible. </sentence><sentence id="4064">That was vital, and I had no radio. </sentence><sentence id="4065">I had nothing, the only way I was told that I can give important and, you know, rapidly information was to go to the Swiss and tell them that I'm a Swiss agent. </sentence><sentence id="4066">And that's what I intended to do, so I arrived -- I traveled and it was quite a distance. </sentence><sentence id="4067">So at night, very late at night, I arrived in a <span class="populated place">village</span>, in a <span class="dlf">square</span> of the <span class="populated

</sentence><sentence id="4074">Boy, I was very happy to have stopped there. </sentence><sentence id="4075">Do you know, I had always an instinct I cannot go. </sentence><sentence id="4076">And then he

there, but very early in the morning I told them I had to be getting up. </sentence><sentence id="4080">And I told them the same story, I always told everybody the same story. </sentence><sentence id="4081">Their husbands were prisoners of war, and they no news. </sentence><sentence id="4082">Or they were killed, they had no news. </sentence><sentence id="4083">But anyway, I left the next
