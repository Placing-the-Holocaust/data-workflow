<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="11">A: My father was, my father's name is Lajos Holczer. </sentence><sentence id="12">He comes from a very poor working class family, a Jewish family that was almost totally assimilated into the <span class="dlf">Proletarian environment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="13">They lived on the outskirts of <span class="populated place">Budapest</span> in a <span class="building">tenement</span> without any water and electricity. </sentence><sentence id="14">My grandmother was practically the sole supporter of the family until the children got a little bit older because my grandfather was a, what you would call a /umpen proletary (ph) person who did not really care too much about father responsibilities. </sentence><sentence id="15">The, so my father was the oldest one who made it into adult life, there was somebody else ahead of him but died of tuberculosis. </sentence><sentence id="16">And he has always been a great support to his brothers and sisters. </sentence><sentence id="17">He was a working man, he has always worked for other people. </sentence><sentence id="18">Eventually, he became kind of a, an amateur druggist, worked for <span class="building">companies</span> but he did not have a formal education and after the war, he joined a <span class="building">co-op</span>. </sentence><sentence id="19">He rose to kind of a mid-level managerial position but he basically was always just a working man. </sentence><sentence id="20">He never went beyond the second grade and he taught himself how to read and write and everything else. </sentence><sentence id="21">He had exceptional qualities in math and law. </sentence><sentence id="22">My mother! </sentence><sentence id="23">comes from a small <span class="populated place">northern Hungarian town</span>, <span class="populated place">Vacz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="24">This is where the <span class="env feature">Danube</span> turns suddenly south and she comes from a middle class family, Orthodox, very religious. </sentence><sentence id="25">She had a brother and a sister, both of them who died in World War II. </sentence><sentence id="26">The sister was deported, the brother died in <span class="populated place">labor camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="27">Her entire family from <span class="populated place">Vacz</span> were, was deported to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> and died there. </sentence><sentence id="28">My mother never had to work, basically, my father was always making enough money and she enjoyed just being a housewife. </sentence><sentence id="29">Anything else? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="49">Q: Did you say how many brothers and sisters your father had? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="51">A: My father had thirteen brothers and sisters, yes, and he was the oldest one to survive, to grow up, because his older brother died, very early. </sentence><sentence id="52">So, the burden of supporting the family was always on him. </sentence><sentence id="53">So he was the provider type and my mother had no basic responsibility. </sentence><sentence id="54">She was basically what you would call a petit-bourgeois lady and I always admired my father's values more than my mother's but that doesn't mean I didn't love my mother. </sentence><sentence id="55">My mother also survived the war with me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="61">Q: How did your father and your mother meet? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="63"> 1 <span class="building">Cornelia Oestreicher</span> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="64">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="65"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="66">A: My father and mother met, so that, my father was working for a <span class="building">wholesale drug distribution firm</span>. </sentence><sentence id="67">By drug I, we mean a <span class="building">cosmetic supply firm</span>, but in <span class="country">Hungary</span> they were called <span class="building">druggists</span>, making <span class="populated place">cologne</span> water, things like that. </sentence><sentence id="68">It had nothing to do with what we call drugs today. </sentence><sentence id="69">It was not a <span class="building">pharmaceutical company</span>. </sentence><sentence id="70">And my, at that time, in <span class="country">Hungary</span> and in Europe, it was the custom of middle-class families to send their daughters to <span class="building">secretarial school</span> and then have them work for a few years for some firm, hoping that they're going to catch a husband. </sentence><sentence id="71">And my mother caught my father there, which was very much to the dislike of her family because my father, they felt, was much below their class and they made him feel that way in all his life. </sentence><sentence id="72">Of course, I cannot really say what would have happened after World War II because my mother's entire family was wiped out, practically. </sentence><sentence id="73">Only a few people who lived in <span class="populated place">Budapest</span> remained. </sentence><sentence id="74">So, but I resented them for a very simple reason, that they looked down on my father who I thought was a, was a very, was a man of integrity and, and hard-working, a good human being. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="84">Q: Were they, how did they treat you as a child? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="86">A: I had a very strange relationship with my mother's family, especially my grandparents because they were very religious and I was born irreligious and whenever I had to visit with them they forced me to wear a hat even in the middle of the summer and eat a certain kind of very strict kosher food, go to the <span class="building">synagogue</span> every night and pray and, and in general, they considered me some kind of a, what they call in Yiddish a shaygets, somebody who is kind of just an outsider because I never really went along with their, with their religious rules. </sentence><sentence id="87">I also resented the fact that my grandmother was kind of a, of a, of a very angry person. </sentence><sentence id="88">I felt that, that the way she treated others and the way she treated my grandfather, I resented that. </sentence><sentence id="89">I didn't like to go there and my mother, of course, always wanted me to go and visit and I have, I just finally decided to take my revenge so I would not have to visit anymore. </sentence><sentence id="90">And one day, this was, I must have been about eleven or so, I went to a <span class="building">butcher shop</span>, got a huge ham hock and got out and when the people went to the <span class="building">synagogue</span> Friday night, I was eating it without a hat and pretty soon they were reporting it to her and they were coming and that was my last visit. </sentence><sentence id="91">They immediately sent me back to <span class="populated place">Budapest</span> and I never had to visit again. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="98">Q: Was your mother angry with you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="100">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="101">My mother was very angry, but my father and I, we always had some kind of an understanding. </sentence><sentence id="102">Even when he scolded me for something that, that had something to do with religion to go along with my mother, I sensed in his voice that it was not serious, that he just did it for my mother's sake. </sentence><sentence id="103">And I also found out since, between 1948 and 1950, I went to <span class="country">Israel</span>, I was in <span class="country">Israel</span> which we will come back later, when I came back and I spoke Hebrew, I realize that my father doesn't know how to pray, that he just mumbles the words. </sentence><sentence id="104">He has no idea, what really, how to even pronounce them and he did this all for, for the love of my, my, my mother and I appreciated this, that he put up this pretense but it was an interesting discovery for me, that. </sentence><sentence id="105">So he never, he never really scolded me and he was practically influential after the war to put down his foot and say, forget about kosher anymore, let's just eat what is available. </sentence><sentence id="106">And so we did not have a <span class="building">kosher household</span> anymore. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="114">Q: Now was your father's entire family not very religious, then? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="116"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="117">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="118"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="119">A: Yes, yes, they weren't. </sentence><sentence id="120">They were Jews, they never, they never doubt their Jewishness. </sentence><sentence id="121">They knew they were Jews but they were secular Jews, you know? </sentence><sentence id="122">And interestingly, quite a few of them survived because of the place where they lived. </sentence><sentence id="123">Since they lived in a <span class="building">Proletarian tenement</span> of--<span class="building">city tenement</span>--that was given to people under a certain income who had too many children and not enough income, there, the Communist Party, the illegal Communist Party had a very strong hold on this <span class="region">area</span> and when, then, the World War II came and the <span class="populated place">Nuremburg</span> laws and everything else, some of these Communist leaders, Communist members, came and actually rescued members of the family. </sentence><sentence id="124">I have an uncle in <span class="country">Hungary</span> and he, for example, was a very good friend of a past Communist prime minister who just died recently because they practically lived side by side. </sentence><sentence id="125">Soa great deal of the Hungarian leadership, Communist leadership, came from this <span class="building">tenement</span>. </sentence><sentence id="126">So that helped rescue them. </sentence><sentence id="127">The Communists were the only, the only group you could really turn to, during those terrible years that, that would help you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="137">Q: So, was religion mainly only recognized in your <span class="building">household</span> on holidays, or . . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="139">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="140">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="141">My, my father always talked to me and said go, you know, to the <span class="building">synagogue</span>, your mother wants you to go and all this and that, but he never really did anything to force me to do whatever with religion. </sentence><sentence id="142">He just asked me to respect my mother's wishes and so I had Bar Mitzvah and that was the last thing that I did. </sentence><sentence id="143">After my Bar Mitzvah I never probably went to <span class="building">synagogue</span> again unless it was a tourist attraction, I just, wanted to see what it is, inside. </sentence><sentence id="144">And, but I never denied my Jewishness so when my grandchildren especially ask me about religion, I say lam a Jew but I'm not Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="145">And they ask me, "How can that be?" </sentence><sentence id="146">And I said, "Well, it's easy." </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="155">Q: Did you have any sort of, any sense of faith? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="157">A: No, not really. </sentence><sentence id="158">It's a strange thing that I have never been somebody who believes in the supreme being and so maybe, eventually, my lot, this is going to be difficult, but because they say people who have faith, they die much easier than the ones who don't, but I always just associated with people who practically felt the same way and it never caused any problems so far in my life, in my sixty-six years. </sentence><sentence id="159">But I can't remember when I really honestly believed in a supreme being. </sentence><sentence id="160">And then of course, the war probably wiped out, if 1 had any doubts. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="165">Q: Will you say something about your relationship with your father? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="167">A: My relationship with my father was always very good. </sentence><sentence id="168">I [indecipherable], I considered him always my, my example, my hero, and I was very very upset when in 1942, he was taken away and sent to a <span class="populated place">labor camp</span> in <span class="country">Yugoslavia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="169">And when he came back in 1945, he, of course, I was overwhelmed and in my memory too, even though I spent more time with my mother, a lot more than with my father because he was also a traveling salesman for a long time and I only saw him on weekends, somehow my memory is much more blurred when it comes to my mother than when it comes to my father. </sentence><sentence id="170">My mother, one reason it might be that my mother died in 1970 and my father died in 1980, so he survived ten more years and since we lived in <span class="country">Europe</span> from "74 on, at least for six years I had a lot more contact with him than I would have if I had stayed in the <span class="country">U.S.</span> I always considered him an absolute statue of integrity and, and honesty and he was always looking out for my interests and I, even though when I as an American, had a very nice living, I made a very nice living and I didn't need any, any material, he was still saving and collecting things for us in <span class="country">Hungary</span> and was always This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="171">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="172"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection giving us a lot of things when we went to visit him and we kept telling him that he should spend it on himself. </sentence><sentence id="173">He, he was just one of the most unselfish people I have ever met in my life. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="183">Q: And you felt this way from the time that you were a small child... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="185">A: Yes, always, always. </sentence><sentence id="186">He was always that way. </sentence><sentence id="187">Just a very simple, very simple man. </sentence><sentence id="188">Very, extremely intelligent, uneducated but a true human being. </sentence><sentence id="189">And with my mother, I always had a little bit of my doubts that she's not as straightforward as my father. </sentence><sentence id="190">And there were little incidents that kind of, as a child, it's amazing how it gets engraved in your mind and you cannot get rid of it. </sentence><sentence id="191">And the thing that I was very, very bitter about, that I could never forgive my mother for, was that while my father was in <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> in <span class="country">Yugoslavia</span>, she took a little job and she worked for a <span class="building">drugstore</span> in the center of <span class="populated place">Budapest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="192">And next to the <span class="building">drugstore</span> was an <span class="building">antique store</span>. </sentence><sentence id="193">Mr. Klein was the name of the man who owned and he liked my mother. </sentence><sentence id="194">My mother was a cute little creature and everybody liked her and so he would wait for her when she closed this <span class="building">shop</span> to escort her <span class="building">home</span> because he lived the same way and I didn't see anything wrong with this, but they noticed how jealous I am of my mother and it's not that I wanted to possess my mother, I just, I was protecting my mother for my father and so he put his arm around my mother and they were looking at me and laughing at how annoyed I became and this picture is constantly in my mind. </sentence><sentence id="195">And I could never forgive my mother for this, that, that she did not realize how hurt I was by playing this silly game. </sentence><sentence id="196">And she was, still she was a good person, she did everything possible to give me a good education and, but, she had a very petit-bourgeois thinking and another thing that somehow stood between the two of us was <span class="spatial object">piano</span>. </sentence><sentence id="197">She decided that I'm going to be a great piano player and I decided that I have no interest in playing the <span class="spatial object">piano</span> and she would sometimes get so annoyed that I did not practice that she would take a rug-beater and run after me and try to beat me but I was much faster than she was sO We were running around the <span class="spatial object">table</span> and then eventually she just broke down and cried that she couldn't catch me but she had this obsession with, with, with <span class="spatial object">piano</span> playing and so again, ever since in World War II, our <span class="spatial object">piano</span> was destroyed. </sentence><sentence id="198">We gave it to somebody for safekeeping and they claimed that the, the bomb got it, whatever, I was glad. </sentence><sentence id="199">She wanted to buy another <span class="spatial object">piano</span> and I said no. </sentence><sentence id="200">When I, when we came up from the <span class="interior space">cellar</span> after liberation, I said, that's it. </sentence><sentence id="201">Iam now a man. </sentence><sentence id="202">I basically rescued my mother more than once during World War II and I said no more <span class="spatial object">piano</span> and I never sat down to play the <span class="spatial object">piano</span>. </sentence><sentence id="203">Never. </sentence><sentence id="204">I never had the urge. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="225">Q: You talked a little bit about your relationship with your mother's family and I was interested in hearing your relationship with your father's family. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="227">A: My father's family was my favorite side of the family. </sentence><sentence id="228">I had a grandmother, a typical Proletarian woman with thirteen children and not much of a husband. </sentence><sentence id="229">And I remember going out and loving every moment of spending time with them because here I came, I was the, the, the second grandchild in the family. </sentence><sentence id="230">There was one older one who, unfortunately, during the war, was killed. </sentence><sentence id="231">So I was kind of the sweetheart of everybody and they were pampering me and taking me to places and my grandmother, I remember, had a tremendous knowledge of how to make beans in at least fifteen different ways. </sentence><sentence id="232">There were beans every time I went out, they had beans, beans, but she was just a marvelous woman, a very warm-hearted, a typical country woman. </sentence><sentence id="233">She came from <span class="region">southern Hungary</span> from a very small <span class="populated place">village</span> and after raising thirteen children during the day, she left them in the care of my father and then went from <span class="dlf">door</span> to <span class="dlf">door</span> selling silk stockings just to add a little bit to the, to the income. </sentence><sentence id="234">The, my father's brothers and sisters were, of course, some of them are only just This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="235">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="236"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection a few years older than I am, so they were almost like brothers and sisters to me at that time and since there was no money at all in the family, they resorted to somehow, illegal things. </sentence><sentence id="237">I remember I loved ice skating and they said, oh no problem and they took a huge scissor--pair of scissors--and cut a big <span class="dlf">hole</span> and pushed me through the <span class="dlf">hole</span> into the <span class="building">ice skating rink</span>, nearby, so we always went ice skating. </sentence><sentence id="238">A lot of things were solved not by very legal ways, but as a child, this was life to me. </sentence><sentence id="239">There were a lot of children in the <span class="building">tenement</span> constantly horsing around and nobody, nobody was constantly bothering me and, and, and disciplining me and getting ahead or going to the <span class="building">synagogue</span>, nothing. </sentence><sentence id="240">It was a great freedom and I just enjoyed it very very much. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="652">A: Well, of course we were always afraid that he would not survive and we had no doubt that physically he could survive but we were afraid that, that he would get killed. </sentence><sentence id="653">But an interesting episode was that, [cough] excuse me, I asked him after the war, what, why did he survive if so many people died? </sentence><sentence id="654">And he had a little, just a short little anecdote, he said, "Son, there were two kinds of people in the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="655">We got a <span class="spatial object">canteen</span> of water every morning. </sentence><sentence id="656">The one group drank the water immediately and the second group, such as myself, drank half of the water during the day and we used the other half to wash ourselves." </sentence><sentence id="657">And I said, "Half a <span class="spatial object">canteen</span> of water would make you clean?" </sentence><sentence id="658">He said, "No, but I felt like a human being, I was still caring about myself." </sentence><sentence id="659">And he said, "And later on I understood a lot more about this whole attitude that I'm not going to lie down here and gulp down everything, I am, even though I am full of lice, I'm still caring about myself." </sentence><sentence id="660">So that, basically, that was the attitude that saved, I'm sure, that was who survived. </sentence><sentence id="661">And of course luck, because even with this attitude somebody could have shot you if they didn't like your face or the way they moved. </sentence><sentence id="662">Yes, we, my mother maintained of course like most wives that he's going to return, and she was right because even though we have not heard from him for a long time, especially the last year when he was there, of course by that time, we couldn't have heard from him because he was already in the <span class="region">liberated area</span> and we were in <span class="country">Hungary</span> still, in the <span class="dlf">battlefield</span>. </sentence><sentence id="663">It was, however, just that, that deep feeling that he will come <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="664">And he came <span class="building">home</span> in 1945, I remember late spring, it must have been April, May, probably, and he did not just stop by and said, "Here I am." </sentence><sentence id="665">He was afraid that maybe we would faint or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="666">He sent a friend up. </sentence><sentence id="667">A man came up and inquired about my father and very slowly kind of asked, "When did you hear from him?" </sentence><sentence id="668">and all this, and "Do you think he's alive?" </sentence><sentence id="669">and all this, and slowly he said, "Well, I have a feeling that he is alive," and slowly he led us to this. </sentence><sentence id="670">I remember him coming up on the <span class="dlf">stairs</span> with a rucksack. </sentence><sentence id="671">The <span class="spatial object">rucksack</span> was full of sausage and potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="672">And he knew that we were starving and so that was it. </sentence><sentence id="673">Now, just to describe the situation in <span class="country">Hungary</span> at that time and how you needed to be, to stay a human being, the, we did not live in our <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, we were moved, because you could not stay in your <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="674">You had to move to first, to so-called <span class="building">Jewish houses</span> that had a big star on them and, eventually to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="675">And because of the history of this <span class="building">house</span>, we did not move into the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> but this <span class="building">house</span> <span class="dlf">Zichy street One</span>, was designated as a <span class="building">Jewish house</span> first. </sentence><sentence id="676">So, in the meantime, we moved out of, of our <span class="interior space">apartment</span> in, that was 1944, summer when you had to This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

said "We will keep this for you, and keep this for you," and needless to say, that not one thing eventually survived again. </sentence><sentence id="680">Or resurfaced again. </sentence><sentence id="681">They all, either the Russians took it, or the bombing or everything. </sentence><sentence id="682">It's all disappeared, and what could you do about it? </sentence><sentence id="683">You said okay. </sentence><sentence id="684">But people were in a way like vultures, they were just circling around and see, you know, what they can take. </sentence><sentence id="685">And then the <span class="interior space">apartment</span> was given, all these <span class="interior space">Jewish apartments</span> were given to bomb those people whose...Gentiles whose <span class="building">houses</span> were bombed and they couldn't live in anymore. </sentence><sentence id="686">And I had no idea of course what happened to our <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="687">We lived in a <span class="dlf">street</span> called <span class="dlf">Rottenbiller Street</span>, 667, and I, my first thing, we were liberated on January 18 and the first thing I went back to see, what, what happened to our <span class="interior space">apartment</span> because we left, believe it or not, a few boxes of linen there, just when we left. </sentence><sentence id="688">We just, we couldn't do anything with it, so. </sentence><sentence id="689">And when I came, when I went up there, I had this tremendous chip on my shoulder that I'm going to show these people whoever are there, that within two hours, I said I'm going to give them two hours to get out of here. </sentence><sentence id="690">And here I was a sixteen year old kid, barely sixteen, fifteen really, and telling them, here was a family and I was telling them to get out of here. </sentence><sentence id="691">And the family consisted of a mother, father, a daughter and two sons. </sentence><sentence id="692">And they were <span class="building">tailors</span>. </sentence><sentence id="693">And the old man was quite old, the father, was telling me, he said, "But, but, where can we go?" </sentence><sentence id="694">And I said, "Why did you come here?" </sentence><sentence id="695">And he said, "Well, we have, we have no place. </sentence><sentence id="696">Our, our <span class="building">house</span> was destroyed, and I mean we knew that this is, this was a <span class="interior space">Jewish apartment</span>, but still it was between this or living in the <span class="dlf">street</span>, in the cold snowy January," so he said, "Could, could you do something, could, could we somehow come to some kind of an agreement?" </sentence><sentence id="697">And so my mother came up and she said, "Why can't we just divide the place between us?" </sentence><sentence id="698">And here it was a two room <span class="interior space">apartment</span> with their family, four people, five people in their families and two, my mother and I, and we decided that after looking at them and listening to them and all this, there was just something that all of a sudden hit me. </sentence><sentence id="699">My chip was gone and so we decided that yes, we were going to, we'll, we'll make it. </sentence><sentence id="700">And so we lived there under the same <span class="interior space">roof</span> and we became very good friends. </sentence><sentence id="701">And when my father came <span class="building">home</span> in late spring, the new government, Democratic government, devised this plan of each <span class="dlf">block</span> had to elect a kind of a small council and the head of that council was quite powerful in deciding if there was an empty <span class="interior space">apartment</span> or, almost like a Justice of Peace. </sentence><sentence id="702">They had certain tasks that they can perform, temporarily, they were deputized. </sentence><sentence id="703">And my father was appointed to do this because he was always very much respected by the people there and the fact that he was now good, you know, with the new regime. </sentence><sentence id="704">And next to us, an <span class="interior space">apartment</span> was full of old, old women who died one after another. </sentence><sentence id="705">It was a, like a <span class="building">Salvation Army place</span>. </sentence><sentence id="706">They, they rented it and it became empty, so my father got the <span class="interior space">apartment</span> for them and they moved over there so we could get our <span class="interior space">apartment</span> back, we lived there, but they could never really thank enough and we, we kept this relationship for a long time and I'm sorry I lost contact with them. </sentence><sentence id="707">But then, we had an <span class="interior space">apartment</span> and then we faced something else because then the Russians were coming around and trying to find places for their soldiers and so they, they got, they got two old Russian soldiers from <span class="region">Siberia</span> who were quartered in, in our <span class="interior space">apartment</span> because two <span class="interior space">rooms</span> were too many for three people. </sentence><sentence id="708">So, and I remember, they were very cute old men, we had no, I mean we had sign language, we didn't speak Russian and the only incident I remember is that my mother, of all these sufferings, had one little symbol in her possession: a bottle of very expensive cologne water that she kept. </sentence><sentence id="709">And she said, "I am going to start using this after the war, when we are all together and we live in peace." </sentence><sentence id="710">And so, and she kept it and she had it with her all the time. </sentence><sentence id="711">And so now, when we moved back, she, we got a temporarily, kind of an <span class="spatial object">armoir</span> and she put it way back between <span class="spatial object">sheets</span>. </sentence><sentence id="712">Now one day we came <span class="building">home</span> and my mother said, "This, this place smells like cologne water, very &gt; When Robert lived there, the <span class="dlf">street</span> number was 39. </sentence><sentence id="713">It was later changed to 66.This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="714">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="715"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 3 good cologne water," and she rushed to her cologne water in the <span class="interior space">armoir</span> but these two Siberians, Russians were very hard pressed to get alcohol, anything, they would drink. </sentence><sentence id="716">I mean, there were stories that I can't believe, that they went to the <span class="building">museum</span> and drank alcohol out of these scientific lab experiments and--including embryos--but I never believed those stories, but this is true. </sentence><sentence id="717">They drank my mother's cologne water. </sentence><sentence id="718">They were so, so hard pressed for alcohol. </sentence><sentence id="719">And that was about our only experience with Russians in our <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="720">Otherwise, most people lost their watches. </sentence><sentence id="721">They were very hard pressed for <span class="spatial object">watches</span>. </sentence><sentence id="722">It was a time when nobody in his right mind would walk around in <span class="populated place">Budapest</span> with a watch on his wrist. </sentence><sentence id="723">They just, they were fascinated. </sentence><sentence id="724">They stop you and they took your watch. </sentence><sentence id="725">That was their, their, their thing. </sentence><sentence id="726">Well, anyway, okay, ask. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="806">Q: So the Russians had moved into your <span class="interior space">apartment</span> then . . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="808">A: Yeah, two. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="810">Q: During the German occupation, this was before. . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="812">A: No, no, no. </sentence><sentence id="813">This was during the Russian occupation. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="816">Q: Oh, after. [ </sentence><sentence id="817">talkover] </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="820">A: Oh yes. </sentence><sentence id="821">I'm talking about after, this all happened after. </sentence><sentence id="822">Oh no, there were no Russians during the German occupation. </sentence><sentence id="823">I wish there were. </sentence><sentence id="824">No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="830">Q: I wanted to go back just a little. . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="832">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="834">Q: .. bit, I had, I had wanted to ask you about when you were younger as a child and you were in <span class="building">school</span>, were your friends mostly Jewish. . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="836">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="838">Q: Or did you share . . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="840">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="841">Mostly Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="842">There were a few Gentile friends who never, ever mentioned religion, never really made us feel inferior, just a few. </sentence><sentence id="843">And after the war, I made it clear how much I appreciated it. </sentence><sentence id="844">So, I'm glad that I could do that. </sentence><sentence id="845">Now, I also have to say that not many of my classmates survived because my Jewish classmates were in a <span class="building">labor battalion</span> and they were working outside <span class="populated place">Budapest</span> on the day when the deportations came to that <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="846">And the <span class="building">gendarmerie</span> had an empty <span class="spatial object">boxcart</span> and they decided not to let them go <span class="building">home</span> but deport them. </sentence><sentence id="847">So very few Jewish classmates of mine survived. </sentence><sentence id="848">Gentiles, again, the war, the army eventually, everybody who was fifteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen at the end of the war, the last few months, the Arrow Cross people, they forced children out into the <span class="dlf">street</span> with a gun. </sentence><sentence id="849">So quite a few of them did not survive. </sentence><sentence id="850">I really had very few contact with, with, with the few that survived but there weren't too many. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="862">Q: And you had mentioned that your father's employer was helping you and your mother out. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="875">Q: And so the help that he gave you then during the time that your father was away was enough for you and your mother to... [talkover] </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="877">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="878">I also took a job. </sentence><sentence id="879">I was a messenger boy up until 19... until the yellow star came into existence... "44 March. </sentence><sentence id="880">I was a messenger boy for <span class="building">architectural firm</span>. </sentence><sentence id="881">Because of the <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span>. </sentence><sentence id="882">I could <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> around then, so I was delivering messages and things. </sentence><sentence id="883">So, that supplemented also, my father's salary which wasn't a full salary, just part of it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="891">Q: And as the war progressed, was the next significant event then, would have been the German occupation? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="893">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="894">1944, March, if I remember it, 19", is when the Germans had serious doubts apparently, that <span class="country">Hungary</span> is not a trusted ally anymore, that <span class="country">Hungary</span> probably entertains the idea of getting out of the war because by that time I think <span class="country">Romania</span> was ready to jump and the situation in <span class="country">Italy</span> was very shaky so they decided to occupy <span class="country">Hungary</span> officially and put in a very right-wing government which was still a lot better than what came in 1944, October. </sentence><sentence id="895">That will be the other <span class="dlf">stage</span>. </sentence><sentence id="896">But let's take a look at what happened when the Germans marched in, the yellow star had to be worn within a few weeks, or... So, the labor battalions were more intensified. </sentence><sentence id="897">Now everybody who was eighteen had to go, that was now, they lowered the limit and the deportations started. </sentence><sentence id="898">So, unfortunately, that was the worst thing, the deportations. </sentence><sentence id="899">They started in the <span class="region">countryside</span>, eventually coming to <span class="populated place">Budapest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="900">They were supposed to come to <span class="populated place">Budapest</span>, you know, by the fall. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="909">Q: You mentioned that your friends were deported one day. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="911">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="913">Q: How did you manage to avoid being deported yourself? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="915">A: That was just an, a coincidence, that my aunt, the one who gained this special status, said to me, "Please, I just have some very bad feelings, I don't want you to go today out and work. </sentence><sentence id="916">Stay <span class="building">home</span>, stay with me." </sentence><sentence id="917">She took me to her <span class="interior space">apartment</span> and that was the day when it happened. </sentence><sentence id="918">It was just a, just a miraculous instinct that she had. </sentence><sentence id="919">And that is what saved me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="925">Q: Did life take a turn after that, after the German occupation did you feel, were you able to feed yourself and your mother adequately? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="927">A: Well, what I did was, I gathered, I was always quite street smart and so I somehow found that the best way to do this whole thing is first to get some papers that would qualify us--at least to those who don't know us--as Christians. </sentence><sentence id="928">So I took my mother's <span class="spatial object">jewellries</span>, sold it, and bought papers. </sentence><sentence id="929">And the papers were blank and you had to fill it out. </sentence><sentence id="930">And I did that. </sentence><sentence id="931">Also, I got some papers and I fill it out with the same name from a cousin of mine who was adopted but had birth certificate and everything else that pertained to the fact that he was a Gentile. </sentence><sentence id="932">And his parents gave me his papers too so I had kind of this double insurance, moving around, in case I needed it. </sentence><sentence id="933">For a while, I did not This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="934">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="935"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 5 use these papers. </sentence><sentence id="936">I waited until, you know, we got the point where it was necessary. </sentence><sentence id="937">Also, there was a danger that until the Russian troops did not cross the <span class="dlf">Hungarian border</span>, it was a matter of a telephone call to find out if you had false birth certificates. </sentence><sentence id="938">All they had to do is call the <span class="region">principality</span>, you know, and that, that <span class="populated place">municipality</span> and check, okay? </sentence><sentence id="939">And so, actually, we waited until practically the first <span class="populated place">village</span> fell and, after that, it was much easier to fill it out, to a <span class="populated place">town</span> or a <span class="populated place">village</span> that had, that was already occupied under occu... Soviet occupation because they couldn't check anymore. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="955">Q: And after that point, did you use those papers? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="957">A: Then, then, then we used the papers for awhile, but it was a, it was very confusing period when we were moving a lot. </sentence><sentence id="958">First, my wife, my mother and I moved to the, the <span class="interior space">apartment</span> of one of my father's friends. </sentence><sentence id="959">They were Seventh-Day Adventists. </sentence><sentence id="960">And they offered their place but soon they learned that Seventh-Day Adventists are just in the same danger as Jews so after consultation, we left. </sentence><sentence id="961">Then we were, we went to a, I was always on the <span class="dlf">street</span>, hearing, feeling, looking, what can happen? </sentence><sentence id="962">Then I took my mother to a <span class="building">Jewish high school</span> which was designated as a <span class="building">clothing supply business</span> for the Hungarian army and it was really a refuge for, for Jews. </sentence><sentence id="963">They were sewing uniforms for the army and it was established by old Hungarian Jewish army officers who wanted to save their skin and their family and hired fake guards in uniform to come in and out of the place, putting on a show and inside they were actually really making, sewing uniforms and delivering it to the army and, and, so I was always, it was just constantly you had to change your position and you had to always look at what seems safe at the moment. </sentence><sentence id="964">And it is possible that something that was safe one week became unsafe the next week because somebody recognized one person in that place when he was walking down the <span class="dlf">street</span>, going into places, "Here is a Jew, doesn't wear a yellow star, what is he doing?" </sentence><sentence id="965">And so, your life depended on nuances, those days. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="975">Q: So you just took off the yellow star? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="977">A: My aunt is the one who just ripped off the yellow star and said, "You stay with me," and then my mother came there, too. </sentence><sentence id="978">And this is how we got to this <span class="building">house</span> in <span class="dlf">Zichy Jeno Street</span>, One, in the <span class="region">Fifth District</span> of <span class="populated place">Budapest</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="981">Q: Now, I think before you even moved into that <span class="building">house</span>, there had been a lot of Allied bombings . . . </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="991">Q: So where were you during that time? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2818">A: They would have gone <span class="interior space">apartment</span> by <span class="interior space">apartment</span> and, of course, if you could prove that you are a gentile, and that was very easy because every concierge had a list, years ago this was a law in <span class="country">Hungary</span>, that every concierge had a list and that had nothing to do with Jews or non-Jews way back, because when you change your <span class="building">residence</span> in <span class="country">Europe</span>, you have to go to the police and report it. </sentence><sentence id="2819">In other words, every <span class="country">European country</span>, they know who is at that point where. </sentence><sentence id="2820">And so this list existed, all they had to do, come and talk to the concierge and all the concierges were basically serving the government, they were in my estimate, what I call the common man, and their attitude changed regarding of what the government was doing and they were lackeys and so there was no big problem, they always could tell who were the gentiles and who were not by just showing the list. </sentence><sentence id="2821">But there were gentiles still living in the <span class="building">Jewish houses</span> who had a nice place and they just didn't want to move, you know? </sentence><sentence id="2822">And so when, for example, at one time we were lined up because the <span class="building">house</span> was discovered and this George Ara Jereczian was not there with his guards. </sentence><sentence id="2823">I think they went to buy, get some rations for the <span class="building">house</span>, and so we were really without any defense, and we were lined up, then the gentiles who are not down there be also lined up because they, apparently they had known what was going on and could identify themselves. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2832">A: We were, yes, we were lined up, we were lined up. </sentence><sentence id="2833">And then in the last moment, a lot of things happened. </sentence><sentence id="2834">This aunt of mine, for example, she was also out, most people who could go on the <span class="dlf">street</span> were always out looking for something to eat and bring <span class="building">home</span> and when she saw her mother, for example, in the lineup, she just went up to her and started to kick her and said, "This stupid slut. </sentence><sentence id="2835">Just, she is so stupid. </sentence><sentence id="2836">Every time people say line up, she lines up, she's not Jewish." </sentence><sentence id="2837">And all this, and in front of those Arrow Cross people, she just dragged her mother out of the <span class="dlf">line</span> up and she had a personality that nobody argued with her. </sentence><sentence id="2838">So they assume that she is a gentile, therefore her mother is a gentile, too. </sentence><sentence id="2839">And then we were saved because George Ara Jereczian came <span class="building">home</span> and immediately, his men immediately went to these punks and said, you know, "Clear out of here in short order, papers and everything else. </sentence><sentence id="2840">And if you want, you know, we'll call the <span class="building">Ministry of Defense</span>." </sentence><sentence id="2841">And so, they knew their job and threatened these people who then left. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2946">A: Oh, we went through the same experience and nobody... in that <span class="building">house</span>, the only people who were taken away were a man between eighteen and, I think it was eighteen and forty-five or eighteen and fifty-five, before, before October 15th when the labor, when they truly were just going to a <span class="populated place">labor camp</span>, labor organizations, that is when all the men, so there were no men until October 15th, between eighteen and fifty-five in that <span class="building">house</span>, they were all taken away. </sentence><sentence id="2947">So, some of the families who lived there, for example, their father was not with them by that time. </sentence><sentence id="2948">And, I don't know of anybody who survived. </sentence><sentence id="2949">In other words, unfortunately, most of these people were then in a forced march toward <span class="country">Germany</span> at the end of the war and somewhere in, probably <span class="region">western Hungary</span>, they were just either killed or died of typhus. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2971">A: Yeah, interestingly, well, there was very little left in our <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, what was left, a couple of <span class="spatial object">boxes</span>, and I don't know why they were left there, this family never touched. </sentence><sentence id="2972">And that, to me, was immediately, I give them some good points for that. </sentence><sentence id="2973">But when I opened it, our <span class="interior space">apartment</span> got a direct hit when the siege of <span class="populated place">Budapest</span> took place and so a lot of the... and most of these <span class="spatial object">boxes</span> contained tablecloth or sheets or something like that, and so they all had big <span class="dlf">holes</span> in them. </sentence><sentence id="2974">And, however, a very beautiful embroidered tablecloth and the napkins we had for a long time until they disintegrated. </sentence><sentence id="2975">My wife mended them and we used them. </sentence><sentence id="2976">And now, what happened to the furniture?A lot we give to neighbors to say, "If we come back, okay, hopefully, you will give it back to us and if we are not, then it is yours," so, and they took it and now not one of them had a piece left that they can give back to us. </sentence><sentence id="2977">They all said the same thing: the Russians took it. </sentence><sentence id="2978">Now, this was the most illogical, stupid thing to say, because the Russian soldiers had two hands, what are they going to do with a <span class="spatial object">piano</span>? </sentence><sentence id="2979">What are they going to do with a <span class="spatial object">table</span>, what do they need it? </sentence><sentence id="2980">The Russians only went for one thing. </sentence><sentence id="2981">Watches. </sentence><sentence id="2982">They had watches up to their ears, it's as if they had never seen watches before, that was the only thing. </sentence><sentence id="2983">They stop you on the <span class="dlf">street</span> and that was the only question, "Davay chasi\" That means, "Give me your watch." </sentence><sentence id="2984">Nothing else, I mean what can a, a foot soldier who is going on and on and on across Europe, what is he going to do with anything that takes up <span class="interior space">space</span> and has weight? </sentence><sentence id="2985">And so it was ridiculous, but nothing, absolutely nothing was returned from the neighbors. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3002">Q: Did any of your friends from before the war return afterwards? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3004">A: Any of my friends? </sentence><sentence id="3005">Well, as I mentioned before, my <span class="building">class</span>, <span class="building">junior high class</span>, was practically totally taken and deported under those very unusual circumstances, so I had to look for the kids who were not my <span class="building">schoolmates</span>, but, or either lower or <span class="building">higher classes</span>, and also the ones that I used to play with when I went to the <span class="dlf">city park</span> which was not far away from us. </sentence><sentence id="3006">And I would say that about half of them I found, but the other half perished, you know, either because of the fires, you know there was bombs, or because they were killed during the Arrow Cross era, after October 15th. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3010">Q: You, in our last interview, had talked a little bit about meeting up with some of your friends around <span class="populated place">Budapest</span> and that you would talk about the war and that was exclusively what you would talk about. </sentence><sentence id="3011">When you met up with them again after the war, what did you talk about then? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3014">A: Well, when I met my friends after the war, number one, we were so full of hatred, we were looking for some kind of an <span class="building">outlet</span>, some organization that we can join, and we found it. </sentence><sentence id="3015">And part of it was they give away shirts, we found a <span class="building">Communist Party</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3016">Imagine, we were fifteen year olds and we saw that people were walking around in red, flaming red shirts. </sentence><sentence id="3017">And we found out that the flaming red shirts come from parachutes and these parachutes were supply parachutes that were dropped by the Soviet forces and the Hungarians got the material and the Communist Party made a kind of a campaign and made it into shirts and would give them to anybody who signed up. </sentence><sentence id="3018">And I think this drew us a lot more than anything else, the four very close friends of mine, whom I knew from the illegal boy scout organization and, luckily, we all survived, we all went and signed up with the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken

reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 4 Communist Party and I think this is the first, or almost the last time, I ever went to the Party because, now we went to a couple of meetings and we were just bored to death, this happened to American communists, too. </sentence><sentence id="3021">Signed up or something, I mean it was the most boring thing, so we never really considered ourself truly Communist Party members because we were, I think, members for a month and then we never paid any fees or we didn't do anything after that, but this was, our first step was to go down to the <span class="building">Communist Party headquarters</span> and sign up with the Communist Party, which was understandable because we felt that the Communist Party was going to be the one that revenges all these atrocities and whatever happened, and then we saw that almost everybody who was in the Arrow Cross movement is also in the Communist Party because people easily turned, that's obvious, you know, a lot of books and essays were written about how anybody who is an extremist in one way can become the extremist in--on the other side. </sentence><sentence id="3022">So we found that and that was disgusting, absolutely. </sentence><sentence id="3023">And the Communist Party knew about it and they defended it and we didn't like that, their terminology, and so we quit. </sentence><sentence id="3024">So then we went back to, and kind of regrouped as old boy scouts. </sentence><sentence id="3025">But our heart was not in it because now, I mean for so many years we could not do anything as boy scouts except go out and hike in <span class="env feature">nature</span>, we couldn't even wear a kerchief. </sentence><sentence id="3026">And so now we could wear a uniform and some of us really bought a uniform, and then we just, we just lost completely our lust for boy scout life and that didn't work. </sentence><sentence id="3027">Then, you know, this was, another year went by and I, of the four, I broke away from the other four and I joined the Zionists. </sentence><sentence id="3028">They just, there were a lot of things that appealed to me, the fact that, finally, I am going to have a homeland, finally, I am going to have a passport, there was adventure. </sentence><sentence id="3029">Immediately, they send me up in the <span class="env feature">mountains</span> and I had to go through a certain instruction, more than one, on more than one occasion. </sentence><sentence id="3030">And they, I advanced, I was pretty eager and good at learning things, and I became a youth leader in the movement and I loved to be with young people. </sentence><sentence id="3031">And so that, to me, was a, was a very happy period of my life. </sentence><sentence id="3032">My only conflict was with my parents. </sentence><sentence id="3033">Since I was an only child, of course, they wanted me around as much as possible, and I reached that rebellious teenage period, I was not too rebellious, but rebellious enough to move out of the <span class="building">house</span> at sixteen and go to a <span class="building">Zionist children's home</span> where first I was just a, a resident and I liked being with my peer group. </sentence><sentence id="3034">There were many, there were many in <span class="country">Hungary</span>, a lot of the survivors, young people of my age, just chose this as a lifestyle. </sentence><sentence id="3035">And what we were doing there, we received a lot of instructions in agriculture, in the language, Hebrew language, in Jewish history, to prepare us when we go to <span class="country">Israel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3036">And my parents, of course, didn't like for me being away at sixteen and I felt really sorry for them and once the rebellious period ended, in about a half a year or so, I moved back <span class="building">home</span> and one of the reasons was that life was too free on these, it was the perfect kind of thesis, anti-thesis, that we were so restricted, now everything was free, I mean, and I was a little bit of a, I was a strange kid because I didn't grow up very quickly to become a man, and I did not like the fact that here were girls of my age who wanted to sleep with me and all this and that, I just, I always pictured myself more of a, an individual, a man who has things to do and I don't, I'm not going to spend a lot of time with, with sex and all this and my mind was not only on just women, let's put it this way, even though I already had sexual experiences and the whole, and because of this, they considered me a little bit of an eccentric so that happy, I moved back <span class="building">home</span> to satisfy my parents, but I didn't stay there long enough because I got an offer at the age of seventeen to go and be a resident advisor in a <span class="building">home</span> for Jewish orphans. </sentence><sentence id="3037">That was on, it was called <span class="dlf">Tarogato Street</span> in the <span class="region">Buda section</span> of <span class="populated place">Budapest</span> where I found a man who became a very good friend of mine, the man who led the <span class="building">institution</span>, a marvelous man, also a Zionist, by the name of Spitzer* and his family, and they were very good to me and I felt very much at <span class="building">home</span>, plus I got a nice salary and all my needs were taken care of there. </sentence><sentence id="3038">Even I had a 4 First name: Imre This is a verbatim

days. </sentence><sentence id="3041">And in the meantime, I also participated very actively in, I changed organizations and left, I was in a, I would say, kind of a petit bourgeois Zionist group and I went over to the Marxists because that suited my philosophy a lot more and I stayed with them and eventually they were the ones that helped me to then immigrate to <span class="country">Israel</span>, that was after, but we'll get to this. </sentence><sentence id="3042">Now I want to talk just a little bit about <span class="building">school</span> because all these times I went to <span class="building">school</span>, too. </sentence><sentence id="3043">Right after the, 1945, as soon as the <span class="building">school</span> started, my mother was determined that I should go to the <span class="building">School of Commerce</span>, the <span class="building">high schools</span> were specialized, and there was one that was called, the <span class="building">Special High School for Commerce</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3044">Can you stop it for a second because I want to close the <span class="dlf">window</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3045">So as I said, my mother was determined that I should go there, of course, I had no desire but I was still a good boy and I started at that <span class="building">school</span> and the fact that it was the middle of the year, basically, and I missed the first half of a year wasn't a big problem because anybody who was a, a Holocaust survivor at that time can just about do anything. </sentence><sentence id="3046">So this was no big problem, the big problem came when I noticed how many of my teachers are outright anti-American, anti-Russian, anti-Semitic, they haven't changed their attitude and there were some other Jewish kids in that <span class="building">school</span> and I got together with them and I asked them if, if we should tolerate this, if they think this is correct and everybody was kind of lying low, the usual way, and I said, "No, I am not going to do that." </sentence><sentence id="3047">There was specifically one teacher who had, I forgot, had a German name, a very small man who not only was anti-Semitic and anti-Russian and anti-everything and very pro-German, but agitating. </sentence><sentence id="3048">He was not just making statements, he was really agitating and in a very emotional way and I was, I just, I reached a point where I just couldn't take it anymore, not after what happened, just, you know, in the last few years and my boy scout commander, and at that time I was still kind of hanging on with the boy scout movement, my boy scout commander was now a member of the new Hungarian Secret Police and he was an officer and he escaped from the <span class="populated place">labor camp</span> and went over to the Russians and all this and came back with the Russian troops already and was one of the organizers. </sentence><sentence id="3049">And I went to see him and I said, "This man should be removed from the <span class="building">school</span>." </sentence><sentence id="3050">And they did take him in and somehow they went down the list at <span class="building">school</span> and found out that I was the one who reported him because it was obvious since I was constantly arguing with him, arguing with him in <span class="building">class</span> and so. . </sentence><sentence id="3051">.End of Tape 5, Side A Tape 5, Side B </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3093">A: I just had to quit. </sentence><sentence id="3094">And then I continued my studies, I did not want to have the same experience again and I went to the Jewish, the <span class="building">Jewish rabbi school</span>, really, what it was, it was a <span class="building">school</span> to educate future teachers, but it was a <span class="building">high school</span> still. </sentence><sentence id="3095">Just like my previous <span class="building">high school</span> was specialized for commercial jobs, this one was, basically, a <span class="building">teaching gymnasium</span>, a <span class="building">teaching high school</span>, which meant by the laws of <span class="country">Hungary</span> at that time that once you finished--and it was instead of four, five classes, so you were nineteen when you finished the <span class="building">school</span>--you were then an <span class="building">elementary school</span> teacher at the age of nineteen without any college education. </sentence><sentence id="3096">I was there at this <span class="building">school</span> and, of course, as far as any kind of a bad experience, I didn't have any. </sentence><sentence id="3097">Now I was among my own people, there were some very, very good friends, I liked the <span class="building">school</span>, it was nothing special, it was not challenging me, the only aspect most of us didn't like is the religious aspect, which we This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="3098">It is not the

to this, I emigrated, emigrated to <span class="country">Israel</span>, and so I never really finished my <span class="building">high school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3101">But out of deference to what happened and all this, I got a diploma. </sentence><sentence id="3102">So I had a <span class="building">high school</span> diploma which, of course, my parents got later because I needed one and... so these are the two <span class="building">schools</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3103">Once I reached this level of the, this, the <span class="building">Jewish teaching high school</span> for, <span class="building">high school</span> for future teachers, whatever, it's very difficult to translate into English, perhaps <span class="building">Lyceum</span> is a good name for it, once I reached that, then as far as my experiences after the Holocaust, there was no problem, you know, it's obvious. </sentence><sentence id="3104">Now, going back, of course in the meantime, in the Zionist movement, a lot of changes took place because we had to go practically <span class="interior space">underground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3105">As the communist regime established itself in <span class="country">Hungary</span> and in 1948 the famous turn, Year of the Turn came about, which happened in every <span class="region">Eastern European country</span>, and the Year of the Turn is an expression when the communists took control, complete power, because until 1948, we had democracy in <span class="region">Eastern Europe</span>, those <span class="country">countries</span> that knew what democracy was. </sentence><sentence id="3106">And <span class="country">Hungary</span> had some very able politicians and was really on its <span class="dlf">road</span> to become a democracy, so was <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>, and probably <span class="country">Poland</span>, too, of course, <span class="country">Romania</span> was very different. </sentence><sentence id="3107">But, in 1948, everything has changed, we became, again, just like with the illegal boy scout group before 1945, I found myself belonging to an illegal organization, Zionism was outlawed because all of a sudden Stalin and company found Zionism, of course, a tool of the imperialists as they called it. </sentence><sentence id="3108">So we were doing, basically, the same things that we were doing before, but now very cautiously, illegally, and meetings were held usually either in some far away <span class="building">synagogues</span>, <span class="interior space">basements</span> or in some <span class="building">Jewish orphanages</span> where it was not very obvious if, let's say, twenty, thirty people came in and out because there were hundreds of people living there anyway. </sentence><sentence id="3109">The, many times we paraded as young communists, if we wanted to have a larger meeting somewhere, singing communist songs when somebody came by, but otherwise doing our own business. </sentence><sentence id="3110">By 1949, early 1949, the situation almost was intolerable and, basically, they wanted to have the whole Zionist movement leave, not the communists, but the Zionist movement wanted to get as many people out as possible, fearing that if <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> is going to turn also completely communist, that there will be no way from <span class="country">Hungary</span> to go anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="3111">By that time we could only go illegally across the <span class="dlf">border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3112">And I think it was in February, 1949, that I got an order from my Zionist leadership to go to a little <span class="populated place">northern town</span>, <span

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3153">Q: I wanted to, I'm interested in hearing how you felt about Marxism, why it was that Marxism appealed to you as far as the type of Zionist organization that you were involved in and hearing a little bit more about how you felt about the politics of the time and the communist takeover. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3155">A: I had very ambivalent feelings like a lot of those Jews who did not come from the upper middle class or upper class. </sentence><sentence id="3156">I came from definitely no better than the middle of the middle class or rather, perhaps, the lower middle class. </sentence><sentence id="3157">My father came from a very low class proletarian family which was very unusual among the Jews of <span class="country">Hungary</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3158">My mother came from a little petit bourgeois family from the <span class="populated place">northern Hungarian town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3159">They thought they were middle class, but it depends on how you classify this, as far as I'm concerned they were kind of a pseudo-petit bourgeois people, the kind who, it's very difficult to define them, but there was not much work and a lot of complaining. </sentence><sentence id="3160">Now, because I never had a very, let's say satisfactory and wealthy life, naturally I had some sympathies with, with the Marxist movement, it's obvious. </sentence><sentence id="3161">Second, I had a very definite sympathy with them because they were the most adamant about taking the war criminals and punish them. </sentence><sentence id="3162">They were the most anti-fascist and all these things appealed to me. </sentence><sentence id="3163">I was, you can consider even though I was not a member, really after my one month experience, I was not a member, at least I didn't consider myself a member of the Communist Party, but I certainly was sympathizing with a lot of their goals, even though I was in a completely different game by that time, knowing I would go to <span class="country">Israel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3164">But, this is probably why I changed my affiliation and went from a bourgeoisie Zionist organization to a Marxist Zionist organization where I felt very much at <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3165">And there were, of course, ugly things happening, the communist takeover in <span class="region">Eastern Europe</span> was not a very pleasant occasion. </sentence><sentence id="3166">And one only had to think a little bit clearly and rise above all this emotion to see that the communists used very nasty methods to eliminate anyone who disagreed with them. </sentence><sentence id="3167">And the more power they grabbed, the more vicious they became. </sentence><sentence id="3168">And of course, eventually I, the Zionists suffered more what anybody who was considered a Zionist or anybody, like my father, who could have been executed if they discovered that he was with Tito, so if you were an enemy for one reason or another, there was no law. </sentence><sentence id="3169">The communists created their own laws, the secret police had free hand and, of course, I began to become very disappointed in that. </sentence><sentence id="3170">My father, he was always a Social Democrat, and he never, never approved what the Communist Party was doing in <span class="country">Hungary</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3171">And he was very courageous because when the Communist Party gobbled up the Social Democratic Party, he sent in a postcard and said, "Excuse me, but I don't want to join you." </sentence><sentence id="3172">Which was very courageous because from there on, you could have been watched. </sentence><sentence id="3173">The fact that he comes from a <span class="populated place">working class</span> and was a very little fish, I think saved his life. </sentence><sentence id="3174">But if he had been a name, probably he would have been killed then. </sentence><sentence id="3175">And so, politics, yes, I kept my eye on politics all the time and this helped me in 1949 to just go, because I figured there will never be peace here, there will never be peace here. </sentence><sentence id="3176">And, do you have any other questions? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3199">Q: Mmm-hmm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3201">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="3202">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="3203">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="3204"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 8 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3209">Q: As far as, you had mentioned that there were some serious anti-Semitic incidents at your <span class="building">school</span> and I am wondering if you had any expectations after the war was over that some of that would be ameliorated and that anti-Semitism was not going to be as much of a problem any more? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3211">A: Yes, I was very naive, really, at the age of fifteen, for some reason, I thought that a better world is coming. </sentence><sentence id="3212">And I was deeply disappointed when I heard that there were even pogroms in the <span class="region">countryside</span> where a few Jews dared to come back to a <span class="populated place">village</span> or a <span class="populated place">town</span> in <span class="country">Hungary</span>, in <span class="country">Poland</span>, in <span class="country">Slovakia</span>, I think the Czechs were the only ones who acted in a very civilized way, but then they were always civilized and the most civilized in <span class="region">Eastern Europe</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3213">That disappointed me, people were killed, survived <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, came <span class="building">home</span> and killed in a pogrom in <span class="country">Hungary</span> and in some other <span class="region">Eastern European countries</span>, two years after the war. </sentence><sentence id="3214">And that made me very bitter and my idealism and my naivete really evaporated. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3219">Q: Did you experience anything directly, any anti-Semitic incidents? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3221">A: I have not been directly in an anti-Semitic incidence because I avoided, I avoided them, I avoided any kind of such thing. </sentence><sentence id="3222">I associated mainly with my own kind because I saw that there is no hope. </sentence><sentence id="3223">Now, this interestingly must have changed to a certain extent because almost every one of my cousins is married to a gentile in <span class="country">Hungary</span>, I think with the exception of maybe two, but every one of them, and the marriages are very solid. </sentence><sentence id="3224">So I, and it's not, they are still not what you would call a truly middle class family, that most of them still stayed in, you know, auto mechanics and this and that, that part. </sentence><sentence id="3225">Now, the ones who are up there, went to <span class="building">college</span> and became dentists and those, they are all married to other Jews. </sentence><sentence id="3226">It's a very interesting phenomenon. </sentence><sentence id="3227">But I have not experienced anything except when, right after the war at <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3228">Okay? </sentence><sentence id="3229">I heard people constantly yelling anti- Semitic slogans, especially at soccer games, but I knew that I can't expect anything else any more. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3239">Q: And you, when you joined the Zionist organization, did you have, did you really have dreams of being in <span class="country">Israel</span>, or that this, that this was something that you felt very strongly about? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3241">A: Yes, I had dreams and that was probably a, a, just a marvelous high of my youth. </sentence><sentence id="3242">The whole, the Zionists did a, a fantastic job in catching the spirit of young people and really giving us what we wanted to have. </sentence><sentence id="3243">We had a relatively free life, we had, we had a picture of a heroic future for us, whether we are going to be still serving in the army in <span class="country">Israel</span> or just working in a <span class="populated place">kibbutz</span> as farmers, almost everything about it had a kind of a super human touch that I'm going to be better than all these people around here who are running around like ants on the <span class="populated place">cities</span> of <span class="populated place">Budapest</span>, I'm going to lead a very healthy life, and finally I'm going to have a <span class="country">country</span>, I have a <span class="building">home</span>, I will have a <span class="region">fatherland</span> and it was, it was a marvelous feeling. </sentence><sentence id="3244">And also, the whole, the whole setup, the whole organization, you know, until then, until 1946 or so, most of the picture that we saw of Jewish people is, is like sheep going into <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3245">And all of a sudden these people come from <span class="country">Israel</span>, they are beautiful looking people. </sentence><sentence id="3246">And not only that, they had courage, the way they carried themselves and they were teaching us a lot of things, you know, <span class="country">Israel</span> sent a lot of, they called them Schliahs, people that, those who are sent, I think, literally. </sentence><sentence id="3247">And they were in charge of all these <span class="populated place">camps</span> where we had to go to where we were taught self-defense and, you know, we lived on a <span class="env feature">tree</span> in one <span class="populated place">camp</span>, I think what, for forty-eight hours, we were given a piece of rope and a knife and we had to stay up, and sleep up there and make our <span class="spatial object">bed</span> and all this. </sentence><sentence id="3248">I mean, which young person doesn't like this? </sentence><sentence id="3249">The whole image of the Jew has changed in our mind and we said, "God, it's This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="3250">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="3251"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 9 beautiful." </sentence><sentence id="3252">And when we were in danger, they were the ones who led us out of danger. </sentence><sentence id="3253">I remember once I was up in the <span class="env feature">Boerzseny mountains</span> in <span class="country">Hungary</span> in a <span class="populated place">self-defense camp</span> for a week and somebody betrayed us to the police and the police surrounded us and there was a <span class="env feature">creek</span>, not deeper, I don't think it was deeper than maybe twenty inches, and guess who is the one who escaped from the <span class="env feature">creek</span> in order to do something, not to save his own skin, but he was immediately telephoning and all this and that and eventually we were released. </sentence><sentence id="3254">The Israeli whatever, diplomat, I can't call them, the diplomat is not the right word because you picture somebody, you know, with a tie and suit and all this, but they were just, I, messengers or whatever, leaders. </sentence><sentence id="3255">And he escaped, he escaped in that <span class="env feature">creek</span>, crawling in twenty inch of <span class="env feature">water</span>, you know, getting on something that blend in with the, with the <span class="env feature">rocks</span>, I mean they were unbelievable, unbelievable people. </sentence><sentence id="3256">And women, you know, it's, it's, okay, after them the women came and, I mean this is a completely different Jew. </sentence><sentence id="3257">I mean, and when I took my wife to <span class="country">Israel</span>, she understood that, that there was just something about those kids. </sentence><sentence id="3258">And so this, this, of course, was, they were idols and it was very easy to follow them. </sentence><sentence id="3259">And they were, they were not really demagogues, I remember quite a few of them who got quite introverted, they were not giving you big speeches or something, but by personal example, they were leaders because we followed them. </sentence><sentence id="3260">So the, the <span class="spatial object">bus</span> going back to my escape from <span class="country">Hungary</span>, the <span class="spatial object">bus</span> eventually reached <span class="populated place">Vacz</span> and, needless to say, it didn't stop there. </sentence><sentence id="3261">Beyond <span class="populated place">Vacz</span>, it became quite dark and our leader suggested to the bus driver that we stop somewhere and eat and there was a roadside <span class="building">pub</span> where they also served food. </sentence><sentence id="3262">We went in and we were given money and we could order something, and in that <span class="building">pub</span>, there was a very beautiful peasant woman, with I don't know how many skirts on her, this was the reason you recognize a peasant woman, in those days they still wore a lot of skirts, you know, that's an Eastern European costume that a dozen skirts is no big deal. </sentence><sentence id="3263">And she started to flirt with the bus driver. </sentence><sentence id="3264">And soon the bus driver came, went over to her <span class="spatial object">table</span>, and they had a good time and, of course, we were getting more and more anxious that this is going to create a big problem here, right? </sentence><sentence id="3265">We knew that we were on a timetable. </sentence><sentence id="3266">All of a sudden, the bus driver said to our leader, "How long do you think we will be here?" </sentence><sentence id="3267">And our leader said, "Well, all these kids eat, oh, a half an hour, forty-five minutes." </sentence><sentence id="3268">He said, "Good, I'll be back." </sentence><sentence id="3269">and left with the woman. </sentence><sentence id="3270">We ate, and our leader said, "Okay, line up outside." </sentence><sentence id="3271">And instead of going back to the <span class="spatial object">bus</span>, he led us down on a <span class="dlf">field</span> into a big <span class="building">barn</span>, I would say about one mile down in a muddy <span class="dlf">field</span>, it was February and snow and mud everywhere. </sentence><sentence id="3272">We all got into the <span class="building">barn</span>, about thirty of us, they closed the <span class="dlf">doors</span>, <span class="dlf">barn doors</span>, and he said, "Okay, don't worry. </sentence><sentence id="3273">Everything will be okay." </sentence><sentence id="3274">After midnight, 1:00 or so, the <span class="dlf">barn door</span> opened and we were, they said we have to get on <span class="dlf">line</span> and marched down, there was the <span class="env feature">river Ipoly</span>, <span class="env feature">I-P-O-L-Y</span>, and that was the <span class="dlf">border</span> between <span class="country">Hungary</span> and <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3275">The <span class="dlf">Austrian border</span> was already sealed, but the Czechs still let Zionist groups come over, it was kind of an arrangement, the Joint did it for a lot of money, however, they didn't know which <span class="dlf">border</span>, <span class="building">Czech border guard</span> was a communist or not, so we have to be very careful. </sentence><sentence id="3276">And once we went beyond the <span class="building">border guards</span>, everything was organized there, I will go back to this. </sentence><sentence id="3277">So as we were marching down, I saw a woman in a leather jacket with a revolver hanging on her hip in blue jeans. </sentence><sentence id="3278">I looked at this woman's face, said, "Hey, I have seen her before." </sentence><sentence id="3279">And I looked and said, "This is the woman in the <span class="building">pub</span>." </sentence><sentence id="3280">This is to show you how organized they were. </sentence><sentence id="3281">I mean, the Germans couldn't have done better, really, with their devilish organization. </sentence><sentence id="3282">I mean, everything, if you understood the whole, they called it <span class="populated place">aliyah</span>, the going of, to <span class="country">Israel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3283">If you understood that, how they did it, you can understand how they could survive. </sentence><sentence id="3284">All right?

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3359">A: I, my best friend in that group was a young man by the name of Zev Rotics. </sentence><sentence id="3360">He lives in <span class="country">Israel</span> at this time still, in <span class="populated place">Haifa</span>, at <span class="building">Rehov Shunamit 14</span>, and we correspond monthly, we have been ever since, ever since that time, and eventually when I left <span class="country">Israel</span>, we corresponded, we kept up and I consider him my best friend. </sentence><sentence id="3361">He's about the only person I keep up with. </sentence><sentence id="3362">Oh no, there was one, another, a man by the name of Nissan Meschel, and I have no, he is in touch with my friend, Zev Rotics, but I lost touch with him, so I have no idea what happened, I just know that he's living there. </sentence><sentence id="3363">But the others, the, I remember one young lady who was with us and she, unfortunately, had eventually pneumonia when we got to <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>, which I will go back to when I continue the story of the journey, and died in <span class="populated place">Vienna</span> of pneumonia, and she's buried there somewhere in the <span class="dlf">cemetery</span> and I always planned to go and visit her, but I always run out of time and I don't know where she is buried, probably there is no more than one <span class="dlf">Jewish cemetery</span>, so when I go back to <span class="country">Israel</span> I'm going to find out because my wife... Zev Rotics, sometimes he goes to the meetings of our old friends and so he would know. </sentence><sentence id="3364">Now, after the <span class="spatial object">truck</span> finally stopped in <span

call it a <span class="spatial object">ship</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3384">It was called the <span class="spatial object">Galil</span>, <span class="populated place">Galilea</span> or <span

would not throw up. </sentence><sentence id="3387">And I remember I was the only one on the <span class="spatial object">ship</span> who could eat. </sentence><sentence id="3388">Everybody else was just constantly throwing up and so we arrived, by the time we arrived in <span class="populated place">Haifa</span>, everybody was just yellow and green and wouldn't want to look at food. </sentence><sentence id="3389">Now, the funny thing about this <span class="spatial object">ship</span> is that a few years ago I was travelling in <span class="country">France</span> with my wife and we stopped in the <span class="region">Loire valley</span> in a small little <span class="populated place">town</span>, <span class="populated place">Blois</span>, and as we were walking in the <span

because he had a definite Arabic name. </sentence><sentence id="3391">And so my wife, I think, told him that I was Jewish, too you know, and this, so he invited us after the deal--which was a good

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3451">A: Yes, everyone went to the same <span class="populated place">kibbutz</span> except the ones who did not want to go to the <span class="populated place">kibbutz</span>, had relatives who were waiting for them and this was a little bit of a disappointment to us because theoretically, everybody was supposed to stay together, but this was not the case. </sentence><sentence id="3452">There were, not everybody wants to live in a <span class="populated place">kibbutz</span> because it is a very difficult living for those who dream of money and wealth and their own <span class="spatial object">car</span> and all this because it's a, at that time it was a very perfect community, but it was a community, you didn't have a great deal that you owned at all, you know, you were lucky if you had a <span class="spatial object">radio</span> that you can call your own. </sentence><sentence id="3453">So we lost, I would say, about one- third of our group who had planned, but not shared their plan with us, to go immediately and stay on the outside. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3459">A: All Zionist youth organizations basically, with very little exception, very few exceptions, were geared toward the <span class="populated place">kibbutz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3460">This was an understanding back in <span class="region">Eastern Europe</span> where we were recruited that <span class="country">Israel</span>, and they always brought the example of the <span class="spatial object">pyramid</span>, that the, we Jews, we always like a <span class="spatial object">pyramid</span> on the top, we had all the, the farmers, and down at the bottom where the <span class="spatial object">pyramid</span> is the largest, we had all the intellectuals, and <span class="country">Israel</span> needed a <span class="spatial object">pyramid</span> upside down, where the largest group is going to be the farmers and the agricultural group, and the smallest one is going to be the intellectuals, the tip of the <span class="spatial object">pyramid</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3461">So almost every Zionist organization, that was the very strong influence and educational goal to teach you to go and be a farmer in a collective, you know? </sentence><sentence id="3462">So that was the reason why most of us did go to a <span class="populated place">kibbutz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3463">And who decided it? </sentence><sentence id="3464">It was decided above, that had nothing to do with us, where we would go, we were assigned to an old <span class="populated place">kibbutz</span>, very old, experienced, large <span class="populated place">kibbutz</span>, called <span class="populated place">Givat Chajim</span>, in <span class="country">Israel</span> which is in, about midway between <span class="populated place">Haifa</span> and <span class="populated place">Tel Aviv</span> and this is where we learned our trade for one year, we stayed there for one year. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3492">A: Okay, I was a tractor driver in the <span class="populated place">kibbutz</span> and worked out plowing everything connected with the <span class="spatial object">tractor</span>, it was called a <span class="spatial object">Falha</span>, that particular branch, and from sacking, you know, flours and up to plowing and then seeding and cultivating, we had, we did everything. </sentence><sentence id="3493">Then we got our own <span class="region">land</span>, own piece of <span class="region">land</span>, which was a <span class="region">reclaimed area</span> on the <span class="dlf">train line</span> between <span class="populated place">Tel Aviv</span> and <span class="populated place">Haifa</span>, it was the, the, the <span class="country">Israel</span> and <span class="country">Jordan</span> swapped land and so <span class="country">Jordan</span> give back a piece of <span class="region">land</span> so the <span class="spatial object">train</span> service can go from <span class="populated place">Tel Aviv</span> to <span class="populated place">Haifa</span> because part of the <span class="dlf">train line</span> was in <span class="country">Jordan</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3494">This was the <span class="region">land</span> that we received, and it was a very dangerous place, so when we, the first day we went out there, I remember, was really hair raising because the tractor drivers had to go down and plow and the, the weed in <span class="country">Israel</span> is much higher than a human being and also we didn't know where the <span class="dlf">mines</span>, if there were any <span class="dlf">mines</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3495">And even though the army supported us and they did give us, you know, generous support there, we the tractor drivers had to go down and practically open up the <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3496">And sO we were very respected in the <span class="populated place">kibbutz</span> for that reason. </sentence><sentence id="3497">Above us was an <span class="populated place">Arab town</span>, <span class="populated place">Tul Karem</span>, which today is under Israeli occupation and still a very hot spot for riots. </sentence><sentence id="3498">And I remember that <span class="populated place">Arab town</span> practically you could see the people on the <span class="dlf">street</span>, and here we were on the other side living, you know, two enemies and of course, I had a lot of adventures because of living on the <span class="dlf">border</span>, but then again, that has not much to do with the Holocaust and I am sure that the <span class="building">Holocaust Museum</span> has a lot of testimonies from Israelis so they don't need. </sentence><sentence id="3499">I don't know, but that's up to you, but I have a lot of stories that came to us as a result of living so close at that time, back in 1948, 1949, on the <span class="dlf">border</span>, you know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3508">Q: I'd be interested in hearing how, what kinds of relations or encounters you had with Arabs in that <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3510">A: Well, when we first showed up, when we first showed up, the first day, there were Arab shepherds down on the other side of the <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span>, the <span class="dlf">border</span> was just marked with a bunch of <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3511">And when they saw us, they emitted a sound like woo-woo-woo, and they were running away, they were just scared to death. </sentence><sentence id="3512">These were shepherds, very poor people, and we didn't know exactly who they were, but we learned eventually, that they were, they were working for the local, you know, sheik or whomever owns the <span class="env feature">land</span> for very little. </sentence><sentence id="3513">And eventually, we also saw that here on this side of the <span class="dlf">border</span> we are plowing with up-to-date 20"-century machinery and we saw not far from us, a man on a <span class="spatial object">horseback</span> whipping people just because they did something apparently that did not please them. </sentence><sentence id="3514">The owner of the <span class="env feature">land</span> had practically complete jurisdiction over these poor fellows, and that was just a few hundred yards from where we were working. </sentence><sentence id="3515">As they got used to us, they came closer and closer and when they saw that we don't mean any harm, they came down to the <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span> many times, watching to make sure that nobody sees them and tried to make friends with us and we did make friends with them for, the main reason is that chocolate was very expensive in <span class="country">Israel</span> those days, cocoa, and we already had quite a few children in our group, babies. </sentence><sentence id="3516">Cigarettes were very expensive for some reason in <span class="country">Jordan</span> and they were very cheap in <span class="country">Israel</span>, American cigarettes. </sentence><sentence id="3517">So they asked, oh, these people offered us a deal, but they did not want to do it during the day because they were afraid that the... <span class="country">Jordan</span> had the best military force, the Arab Legion, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="3518">It is not the primary

trained by the British and they were afraid that they were patrolling there and all this and it was a serious crime to deal with, with Israelis. </sentence><sentence id="3520">So at night in the darkness, and I remember it was my turn, too, it was always a few people and always the tractor drivers because we had the contact with the <span class="dlf">border</span> people, we went down because they would recognize us and it was a very risky thing, they could have just shot me dead right there, it could have been a trap. </sentence><sentence id="3521">We went down and we were doing all the business, they jumped over or we went over, but mainly they came over because they were much better <span class="dlf">fence</span> jumpers than we were. </sentence><sentence id="3522">So this was one contact that we had. </sentence><sentence id="3523">The other one was not so pleasant, these <span class="env feature">wadis</span>, dry <span class="env feature">river beds</span>, that run across, they don't recognize <span class="dlf">borders</span>, they run, you know, back and forth, <span class="country">Israel</span>, <span class="country">Jordan</span>, and in, when they are dry which is most of the time, this is where the Arab thieves come over, they use these <span class="env feature">river beds</span> because you can't see them, they are, you know, they are like little <span class="env feature">canyons</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3524">And they would come over in these <span class="env feature">river beds</span> and go into other <span class="region">areas</span> and steal, mainly animals. </sentence><sentence id="3525">And they were unbelievably good thieves. </sentence><sentence id="3526">They would steal, they can, they would steal a cattle, they would steal a donkey, they would steal a horse surrounded by <span class="dlf">walls</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3527">Nobody could ever figure out how they did it. </sentence><sentence id="3528">So the army hired us to be kind of a paramilitary force and go out and lie, so we had to lie down in the <span class="env feature">wadis</span> and a few of us, we didn't have very good guns, we had old Czech guns, and wait for these thieves to come. </sentence><sentence id="3529">And I only had one occasion when three of us were in a patrol and there were about fifteen or twenty of these coming by and we didn't feel like getting murdered by them because what chances do we have?And so we let them go by and then reported to the <span class="building">border police</span> that they went by, but we didn't want to engage in any fire fight there. </sentence><sentence id="3530">Now, my good experience was with the Jordanian Legion, which then eventually had also a sad ending. </sentence><sentence id="3531">All of a sudden one day we were, I was plowing I remember, and I had to have always a guard on my <span class="spatial object">tractor</span> with a submachine gun who was constantly casing and watching because I was so close to the <span class="dlf">border</span> and this was a friend of mine one day who was a guard in an <span class="populated place">Arab POW camp</span>, an <span class="populated place">Israeli POW camp</span>, guarding Arabs during the War of Independence, so he learned some Arabic from them. </sentence><sentence id="3532">And you will see why this is important, and all of a sudden we saw some, an Arab Legion patrol right by the <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span> and they were motioning to us to come down and we said no, you know. </sentence><sentence id="3533">And so they went away. </sentence><sentence id="3534">Next day they came and again they were motioning, they said, "Peace, peace." </sentence><sentence id="3535">So finally they went back about fifty yards and they put their guns into a <span class="spatial object">pile</span> and then came back, showing that they had no weapons and they told us, "Sit down on that side of the <span class="dlf">border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3536">What can we do?" </sentence><sentence id="3537">They were about twelve, if they really wanted to kill us, we said, "Okay, let's go down. </sentence><sentence id="3538">What do they want?" </sentence><sentence id="3539">They just wanted to talk to us and from there on, every day they would come down at a certain time and eventually they, the Arabs have watermelon all over, so it was like a party, they would yell at one of these poor fellows who was working there and I, this is all I learned in Arabic, what it is, "Hey, bring me a <span class="spatial object">watermelon</span>." </sentence><sentence id="3540"><span class="building">Yalla Jibbu Battiyah</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3541">And they brought a <span class="spatial object">watermelon</span> and they would slice it and we were eating, almost every day we had a little lunch there together, we brought some stuff. </sentence><sentence id="3542">And this went on for weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks. </sentence><sentence id="3543">And eventually we really fooled our countries because sometimes they came over and ate and laughed that they ate in <span class="country">Israel</span> and sometimes we jumped over and we said, "Oh, we ate in <span class="country">Jordan</span>." </sentence><sentence id="3544">And one day it was our turn, we stopped the <span class="spatial object">tractor</span>, they haven't come down yet so we were waiting for them, but we were already sitting on the other side, we had a little blanket, we put it down, all the food from our <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> and all of a sudden a patrol is there, but it is a totally different patrol. </sentence><sentence id="3545">What happened, apparently somebody saw them and reported them, I don't know what ever happened, I never saw them again and these guys were, they drew their guns and they are going to shoot us. </sentence><sentence id="3546">And you know that <span class="dlf">border</span> was no joke, every night somebody was killed there, either an Israeli or an Arab. </sentence><sentence id="3547">Very innocent people, you know, sometimes a, one night I felt so badly, a young couple, lovers, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="3548">It is not the primary source,

walking around and apparently they were in the wrong place and an Israeli guard, and most of the Israeli border guards were from <span class="country">Arab countries</span>, Arab Jews, well, not Arab, that sounds kind of strange, but Jews from <span class="country">Arab countries</span>, and they were vicious. </sentence><sentence id="3550">I mean, you could not get better border guards and they were, they hated the Arabs more than we hated the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="3551">And so they were, they were, they saw one at night, they were shooting sometimes for no reason. </sentence><sentence id="3552">So that was a very poisonous atmosphere there, and I mean it took a long time and the fact that my friend spoke some Arabic and all this and mitigated the situation, but then the man said, "How come you speak some Arabic? </sentence><sentence id="3553">Where did you learn it?" </sentence><sentence id="3554">And then he had to kind of, so finally the sergeant who was leading all them, always a master sergeant leading the patrol, he said, "You have one luck that I have a son of your age." </sentence><sentence id="3555">He said, "If I ever see you even down touching the <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span>," he said, "T am going to just make dust out of you." </sentence><sentence id="3556">And of course, we never went back again. </sentence><sentence

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3611">A: Well, it was a very simple conversation because we had a language problem, it was mainly sign language quite a bit, and we were talking about, basically, these people were talking about their children, they showed pictures of their families and the word peace, Salaam or Shalom in Hebrew, was constantly mentioned. </sentence><sentence id="3612">And I have a feeling that all of us involved, probably, if they are, hopefully they are alive, will always remember this and that kind of softened us up, so we know that human beings can relax under certain circumstances and we don't have to be enemies. </sentence><sentence id="3613">It was the first time that I realized that an Arab can, doesn't necessarily have to be my opponent, you know? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3673">Q: Before we go into more details about that, you mentioned that you found the Israelis very well organized as you were escaping from <span class="country">Hungary</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3674">When you arrived in the <span class="populated place">kibbutz</span>, did you, did you share the feeling that the way that the <span class="populated place">kibbutz</span> was organized was, was very good and smooth and, did you have any observations about that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3677">A: The <span class="populated place">kibbutz</span> was also very well organized, this was an old <span class="populated place">kibbutz</span> and it was like a clock work. </sentence><sentence id="3678">Also, there was a hierarchy which naturally some people didn't understand, but I had no argument with that because I realized a person who came here fifty years ago when there was nothing here except <span class="env feature">rocks</span> and Arabs shooting at them, has, is more equal, right, than somebody who arrives here today. </sentence><sentence id="3679">It was well run, it was a wealthy <span class="populated place">kibbutz</span>, there was very good food, there was culture, they made sure that orchestras are coming, good ones, entertainment, no, I had absolutely no feeling of let down in this respect. </sentence><sentence id="3680">No, I admired the way they carried on. </sentence><sentence id="3681">Just a little, just a little thing that shows that how they thought of everything: shoveling manure, for example, of course, not something that somebody wants to do for the rest of his or her life, so or washing dishes in the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>, so there were, there were certain things in the <span class="populated place">kibbutz</span> that it was not a, an <span class="region">area</span> where you were assigned permanently, they were temporary. </sentence><sentence id="3682">And so everybody knew that once in a month I have to shovel manure and once a month or twice a month, I have to wash the <span class="spatial object">dishes</span>, so, there were some other, but even this was taken care of, you know, I think in a very human manner. </sentence><sentence id="3683">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="3684">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="3685"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 7 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3695">Q: Did you have dreams or ideas of what exactly you would be doing when you went back to <span class="country">Hungary</span>, was that... was your sense of where you wanted to go in your life very developed? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3697">A: I was naively thinking about going to the <span class="building">university</span> and continuing with my education to become a teacher, a <span class="building">high school</span> teacher, and so I went back through the <span class="env feature">Bosporus</span>, <span class="country">Turkey</span>, <span class="env feature">Black Sea</span>, <span class="country">Romania</span> and then <span class="country">Hungary</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3698">Travelling through <span class="country">Romania</span> by <span class="spatial object">train</span>, in 1949, excuse me, 1951, was quite an experience, the people just looked at me, looked at me and since there are quite a few Hungarians in <span class="country">Romania</span>, I then... eventually they found out that I speak Hungarian, so there was always a Hungarian there and asked me and I very naively give all the details of my life and all this and that, and I didn't understand why they looked at me, just looked at me, just looked at me, and also <span class="country">Romania</span> was tremendously gray and I could only think of 1984, going across <span class="country">Romania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3699">And that was only the beginning, 1951, you know? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3703">Q: You're referring to the book, 1984? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3705">A: Pardon me? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3707">Q: You're referring to the book? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3709">A: Yes, I refer to the book /984, or the movie rather, okay? </sentence><sentence id="3710">It's the same thing, but the movie is the one that I always keep in my mind when I think of <span class="country">Romania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3711">So I arrived on the <span class="dlf">Hungarian border</span> and here was an officer on the <span class="dlf">border</span> looked at my papers and all this and he, I'll never forget what he told me, he said to me, "I don't know where you come from, but it must have been very bad, very bad there, that you come from." </sentence><sentence id="3712">And he looked at me and said, "Welcome to <span class="country">Hungary</span>." </sentence><sentence id="3713">And this was a border guard officer. </sentence><sentence id="3714">And I thought this is a strange thing, what does it mean? </sentence><sentence id="3715">Well, I learned very quickly. </sentence><sentence id="3716">When I boarded the <span class="spatial object">train</span> again on the other side of the <span class="dlf">border</span>, it was just as gray as coming through <span class="country">Romania</span> and then finally when I arrived <span class="building">home</span>, I looked around, I realized that I was totally, totally misled. </sentence><sentence id="3717">Never have I been misled before or after the way I was. </sentence><sentence id="3718">I arrived there and it was the grayest, most colorless, most suspicious, paranoid society you can imagine. </sentence><sentence id="3719">And my bad period started with, of course, not being able to get a job, any job, there was no one, going to the <span class="building">university</span>, of course, was ridiculous to think about because I was an unreliable element, I came <span class="building">home</span>, number one, from the <span class="region">West</span>, I was an imperialist agent, as far as they were concerned, not only that, I was a Zionist imperialist agent. </sentence><sentence id="3720">And it took me almost six month to get a job to sweep a <span class="interior space">floor</span>, to sweep <span class="interior space">floors</span> and clean oil off the concrete in a <span class="building">garage</span>, in a <span class="building">state-owned garage</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3733">Q: How did you get the job? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3735">A: With great connections, the fact that my father was from the working class and many of his brothers and their friends were involved, but mainly their friends of where they come from, this <span class="populated place">suburb</span> of <span class="country">Hungary</span>, a very poor one, suburb of <span class="populated place">Budapest</span>, where now the communist officials with great connections, but nobody wanted any names, nobody wanted to stick out their neck, they just somehow pushed some paperwork somewhere and I was an, kind of an auxiliary labor help, a no name person whom they hired because they needed somebody to clean something. </sentence><sentence id="3736">And that was the only job I could get. </sentence><sentence id="3737">What hurt me even more was the fact that my good friends on the <span class="dlf">street</span>, some of them who stayed in <span class="country">Hungary</span>, not too many because most of them escaped, but they would This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="3738">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="3739"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 8 not want anything to do with me because most people didn't want to touch me, didn't want to talk to me, they don't know me, they rather would go to the other side of the <span class="dlf">street</span> than to meet me. </sentence><sentence id="3740">Some probably out of disgust that how stupid a human being can be to come back to this, and others for fear. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3748">Q: Because you had been in <span class="country">Israel</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3750">A: Yes, yes, because I had been out, it doesn't have to be, it didn't have to be <span class="country">Israel</span>, anyone, it was a totally paranoid society, everything that happened in the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span> was copied the next day, you know. </sentence><sentence id="3751">So the, I worked in this <span class="interior space">garage</span> for about six month and I always noticed with great nostalgia, how they have these posters about urging workers to go to <span class="building">college</span> and I wanted to go to <span class="building">college</span>, and I went to the Party secretary of the <span class="building">firm</span> which had about twelve <span class="building">garages</span>, had to sign a paper that recommends you to go to the next <span class="dlf">step</span> and every time I went to see him, he laughed at me, he said, "You know that you are here by the grace of a few people and not, you have no merits to go there." </sentence><sentence id="3752">So the, my break came when the secretary became very ill, the Party secretary of the <span class="building">firm</span>, and they sent out a temporary Party secretary, and she was a woman, she was very busy when I entered, you know, dirty and overalls and all this, and when I told her what I wanted, I got an, this opportunity and try, now, when I told her what I wanted, she said, "Well, I don't have time to write you a recommendation. </sentence><sentence id="3753">I'm glad that a worker wants to go to <span class="building">college</span>, we need working youth, why don't you dictate what you need to my secretary and I will just sign it." </sentence><sentence id="3754">So I passed the first <span class="dlf">hurdle</span>, with this I went to the <span class="building">university</span> where I had to submit this. </sentence><sentence id="3755">This was a committee, they interviewed you and they read your, you had to write your, your biography, autobiography for everything, everything. </sentence><sentence id="3756">So here was a committee, admitting committee, the Young Communist League, the Communist Party, one from the <span class="building">faculty</span>, et cetera, about, I would say, seven, eight people. </sentence><sentence id="3757">And when they got to certain points, they said, "Come on, you must be joking that you really think that, you know, you can come here." </sentence><sentence id="3758">Well, I left and as I was going out a man whose name was Mr. Bartos, he was on the faculty, this was the <span class="building">Hungarian Teachers Academy</span>, this was the <span class="building">university</span> where I wanted to go, it was called the <span class="building">Teachers Academy</span>, but it was part of the <span class="building">university</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3759">He came out and he said, "Holczer, Holczer, didn't your father play on a certain soccer team?" </sentence><sentence id="3760">I said, "Yes." </sentence><sentence id="3761">He said, "Didn't your father have four or five brothers playing on the same soccer team?" </sentence><sentence id="3762">And he said, "Yes." </sentence><sentence id="3763">And he said, "Okay, come back in September and see, maybe since you were a minor when you left the <span class="country">country</span>, I will try and write to the <span class="building">Ministry of Education</span>, maybe something can be done." </sentence><sentence id="3764">Well, I was holding my breath for three months, I went back in September and I went into the Party secretary's <span class="building">office</span>, they had no idea who I was, they couldn't find any paper, anything, so I was looking for him. </sentence><sentence id="3765">And I found him and he said, "Just a second." </sentence><sentence id="3766">He went into the Party secretary, he came out a few minutes later and he said, "I am very happy to inform you that the Minister of Education, on the basis that you were a minor when you left <span class="country">Hungary</span>, give you special permission to enter the <span class="building">university</span>." </sentence><sentence id="3767">And he said, "Now, this was the last time you ever talk to me, you ever looked at me, you ever even thought that we have anything to do with each other. </sentence><sentence id="3768">Never again." </sentence><sentence id="3769">He said, "That is the price. </sentence><sentence id="3770">You understand?" </sentence><sentence id="3771">I said, "Yes." </sentence><sentence id="3772">Said, "and say hello to your dad." </sentence><sentence id="3773">That was it. </sentence><sentence id="3774">I went <span class="building">home</span>, my father remembered him, they played on the same team. </sentence><sentence id="3775">And he was the head of the physical education branch of the faculty, you know?And this is how I got in. </sentence><sentence id="3776">And I had a very, very good time because I found out ninety-nine percent of the kids thought the same way as I did and there were very few communists, very few. </sentence><sentence id="3777">And yet, when it came to 1953, I almost was, I was thrown out for about one week. </sentence><sentence id="3778">Stalin was dying and when he, in his last breath, he looked up, he saw doctors around him and he was paranoia, he said, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="3779">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="3780"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 9 "Who are these?" </sentence><sentence id="3781">They said, "<span class="building">Doctors</span>." </sentence><sentence id="3782">And Stalin was very anti-Semitic and he said, "Are they Jewish doctors?" </sentence><sentence id="3783">And I think, out of twelve or so, seven or eight were Jewish, they said, "Yes." </sentence><sentence id="3784">They said, "Arrest them." </sentence><sentence id="3785">And they were, all the doctors around Stalin were arrested a few days before he died. </sentence><sentence id="3786">And then, when this happened, in <span class="country">Hungary</span>, too, they were looking for Jewish doctors or anybody who was, had anything to do with Zionists because they called them the Zionist conspiracy against Stalin and they found me at the <span class="building">college</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3787">They had to, since this was a chain reaction, that went down. </sentence><sentence id="3788">So they found me and they told me to go <span class="building">home</span> and that I am a Zionist this and Zionist that. </sentence><sentence id="3789">And Stalin died three days later and I mean, I was just heartbroken because it was before exams and all this and it was in March and I was ready to take my exams soon and then when everything died, died down, and the so-called Thaw, this is what they called it politically, the Thaw started, then they called me back and they said forget about the whole thing and continue. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3833">Q: You mentioned in the last tape that your father had, after he returned from <span class="populated place">Bor</span>, he was appointed on a committee for <span class="building">housing</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3837">Q: What, what happened with his work, with his career, did he remain on that committee after the communist takeover, or did he continue, you also mentioned that he went back to work for his former employer, did he continue to work for this former employer? </sentence><sentence id="3838">What became of his career? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3841">A: My father's former employers, either died or escaped in 1947 or 1948, to the <span class="region">West</span>, so this, what I mentioned, was a volunteer work. </sentence><sentence id="3842">Everybody, basically, had to volunteer to do something. </sentence><sentence id="3843">This was volunteer work, he volunteered to be appointed to this position and this was not a paid job. </sentence><sentence id="3844">And it did not require a great deal of his time. </sentence><sentence id="3845">He immediately looked for some opportunity and started to work for a <span class="building">co-op</span>, a lot of <span class="building">co-ops</span> started and what <span class="building">co-ops</span> were are a group of people who banded together and formed a what you would call a, maybe a small enterprise, as long as they worked under the ruse of a cooperation and everything was divided, the profit if there was any, and they paid their taxes to the state, this was what the communists considered kind of a happy in- between of <span class="dlf">state farms</span> or state enterprise and private enterprise. </sentence><sentence id="3846">Because private enterprise was phased out gradually, except in cases such as a shoe maker that, you know, repairs shoes, but even for that, eventually, they had <span class="building">co-ops</span>, <span class="building">shoemaker co-ops</span> or <span class="building">tailor co-ops</span> or this, but a few, a few of those branches, that you could not really work any other way except in a <span class="building">co-op</span>, but he was working for a <span class="building">co-op</span> where he rose eventually, he was a very smart man, and he rose to be kind of a midlevel manager, but also working and this <span class="building">co-op</span> was working with a lot of women who would then get the merchandise and do it at <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3847">They were making shopping nets and <span class="spatial object">shopping bags</span> and things like that that anybody can do on a <span class="spatial object">sewing machine</span> at <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3848">And then they would bring it in and so actually they had a very, a very small <span class="region">area</span>, a very small <span class="building">base</span> and just a <span class="building">warehouse</span> and he enjoyed this, he enjoyed it and he was very much liked. </sentence><sentence id="3849">The only problem he had occasionally is that they asked him, because he was such a good worker, and he received all kinds of awards that he didn't really want particularly because he was not very, you know, infatuated with the communist system, they always wanted him to join the Party because he was a perfect, what they called cadre, cadre, he comes from the working class, he was a hard-working man, he was an honest man, he rose from nothing to a midlevel manager, so he was an ideal person. </sentence><sentence id="3850">But he never joined, he always said, "No, absolutely no." </sentence><sentence id="3851">So that, he was such a good worker, they left him alone. </sentence><sentence id="3852">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="3853">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="3854"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0 </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3917">A: Oh, the Russian exam. </sentence><sentence id="3918">And then I found out later that some of my classmates had the same problem and, eventually, they decided not to, not to have us back, so they just gave us a D and they were very angry about it. </sentence><sentence id="3919">But in a way it was their fault, too, because how could we get up to that point, going through all classes, didn't they realize that something is wrong? </sentence><sentence id="3920">Well, this, I remember this very distinctly, that that was one way to show our reaction to what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="3921">And otherwise, even the ones who were very active in the Communist Party, most of them always gave us a signal that this is all a show, there is nothing to worry about. </sentence><sentence id="3922">There were very few people. </sentence><sentence id="3923">So when I left the <span class="building">college</span>, at that time, you, I became a teacher and we were supposed to go to the <span class="region">countryside</span>, they could not, you could not teach in <span class="populated place">Budapest</span> the first year and I was then assigned to a little, small <span class="populated place">village</span>, not far from <span class="populated place">Vacz</span>, from my mother's birthplace, only a few miles and taught there for a year. </sentence><sentence id="3924">And this was a small <span class="populated place">village</span> of a minority, <span class="country">Hungary</span> has very few minorities, but they have some Slovak minorities in the <span class="region">North</span>, these were Slovaks and they speak, they spoke very little Hungarian, but they would not admit it because they were afraid that there would be repercussion, so they asked for a Hungarian teacher, they could have asked for a Slovak-speaking teacher, too. </sentence><sentence id="3925">And it was quite an experience, but it has nothing to do with being Jewish or with the Holocaust, none of that came up, it was just a totally different one. </sentence><sentence id="3926">And then after this year that I spent in... I made contact again, I wanted to get back with a youth organization and I found interestingly that the Communist Youth Organization, the Pioneer organization probably could use me because, I mean I went through the boy scouts, I went through the Zionists, I had some very definite ideas and I answered an ad and became a director of a <span class="building">summer camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3927">They looked for a young teacher who, I had about twelve other young teachers with me and it was in <span class="populated place">Budapest</span>, it was just a <span class="populated place">day camp</span>, and it turned out to be such a good experience that the local Communist Party secretary asked me if I would like to come and teach in the <span class="populated place">district</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3928">And I said, "Naturally, this is it!" </sentence><sentence id="3929">And so I was transferred to, just to a <span class="populated place">suburb</span> of <span class="populated place">Budapest</span> and I taught there until the Revolution came and I escaped again. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4407">Q: Were you not... did it seem strange to you that it would be the group of Black co-workers, rather than Germanic co-workers who would befriend you, or did you think that that had anything to do with you being Jewish, or did you reject friendships with the German descent co-workers? </sentence><sentence id="4408">What was the story with that? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4841">A: Why <span class="populated place">Fresno</span>? </sentence><sentence id="4842">Yeah, people always ask me this question, because I'm the most unlikely person to end up in a <span class="populated place">central California town</span> of practically no distinction. </sentence><sentence id="4843">Hundred, hundred ten degrees heat. </sentence><sentence id="4844">Why <span class="populated place">Fresno</span>? </sentence><sentence id="4845">Because they were the only ones, back those days, who answered my letters...not giving me a scholarship, because I had trouble getting my records together from <span class="country">Hungary</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4846">It was against the law, at that time, to send anything out, and I had to wait for my parents to find an opportunity to send it out with somebody. </sentence><sentence id="4847">And so, I just... a <span class="building">college</span> had to accept me on my word, and apparently they were afraid to do that. </sentence><sentence id="4848">But <span class="populated place">Fresno</span> said okay, you can come, spend a semester, we'll find out how you function here, and then we will determine your status, based on that. </sentence><sentence id="4849">And we cannot give you a scholarship, but we can assure you about the National Defense Scholarship, which was given to people who eventually end up in education. </sentence><sentence id="4850">And so I| applied for that, and I got a National Defense loan, excuse me, not scholarship. </sentence><sentence id="4851">That's what it was called back then. </sentence><sentence id="4852">And I received that loan, and so eventually, after <span class="country">Alaska</span>, I ended...

I found some goodness. </sentence><sentence id="4859">So we had some little differences, but all in all, I liked the people in <span class="populated place">Fresno</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4860">I liked them. </sentence><sentence id="4861">I had a lot of foreign, foreign students, colleagues in the <span class="building">college</span> and it was probably easier for me to navigate there, than if I had gone to a big <span class="building">institution</span>, where I would have been just a strange fish. </sentence><sentence id="4862">Here I had a chance to talk to professors. </sentence><sentence id="4863">It was just a very relaxed atmosphere. </sentence></p></dialogue>

I didn't really consider teaching these children a great deal different than teaching regular children. </sentence><sentence id="4975">As a matter of fact, in certain aspects, in certain sense, it was even easier because they were so loyal and devoted to you. </sentence><sentence id="4976">Naturally, there were some problems with emotionally disturbed kids, who were in this group, too. </sentence><sentence id="4977">But basically, it was easy, because of their love and devotion. </sentence><sentence id="4978">And I stayed in it for ten years, and after ten years, I honestly said to myself, I'm burned out, I have nothing more to give, and this is when I This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="4979">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="4980"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 7 returned to regulating... teaching so-called normal children, if there is such thing. </sentence><sentence id="4981">And my wife, yeah, I met my wife at a teacher's meeting, and our superiors, our administrators, were a rather strange bunch of people, who had sometimes very unreasonable requests, and it had nothing to do with education, such as we should have two pairs of shoes in our <span class="interior space">drawers</span>, so we would never have dusty shoes. </sentence><sentence id="4982">And saying this to people who had to go out in the <span class="interior space">playground</span> almost every hour, I mean it was strange. </sentence><sentence id="4983">And they criticized the way we dressed or what we said, or we looked, and they didn't much do it to me, but to... because I was a man, and I was the only man on the faculty of the <span class="region">county</span>, but mainly to women. </sentence><sentence id="4984">And... so | met my wife and at that time she was married with three children. </sentence><sentence id="4985">And she struck me as a kind of a person who doesn't really want others to know much about her. </sentence><sentence id="4986">And I found out later there was a reason for that. </sentence><sentence id="4987">Then...and we just discussed things, and I in my mind said, "Oh, this lady's quite cold." </sentence><sentence id="4988">That was my first impression. </sentence><sentence id="4989">And never bothered really much. </sentence><sentence id="4990">But, our <span class="dlf">path</span> crossed at these meetings, and eventually, she was writing some kind of a publication for mentally retarded teachers, and she called me up, and... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5024">A: Yeah, and as I was saying, first, I was not really very impressed, because she was not very warm. </sentence><sentence id="5025">And then the relationship changed after her phone call, when she asked for some help, because I thought if a woman is really cold and reserved, she wouldn't call me and ask for help. </sentence><sentence id="5026">And so I called her back and we started to chat, and from there on, occasionally, we called each other. </sentence><sentence id="5027">But we never talked about personal things, and so, the whole thing kind of petered out. </sentence><sentence id="5028">And then, later, a year or two years later, I was invited to a party, and to one of our colleagues, and he said, "Oh, by the way, Jan got a divorce. </sentence><sentence id="5029">She is divorced, and she looks good." </sentence><sentence id="5030">And according to...excuse me... according to Jan, I said, "Wow," which I deny. </sentence><sentence id="5031">I never said such thing. </sentence><sentence id="5032">But anyway, this, or whatever I did, or said, they considered it some kind of a sign for me that I would like to see her. </sentence><sentence id="5033">So they invited her and kind of matched us together one evening, and we hit it off just right. </sentence><sentence id="5034">And from there on, I began to see her more often, and eventually, we just decided that this was a pretty serious relationship. </sentence><sentence id="5035">But I was thirty-seven, thirty-six and a bachelor, and I just was not going to get married without giving it some thought. </sentence><sentence id="5036">So, I did what my previous girlfriend did, and signed up for one year to go and teach for the Army in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5037">And [ arrived there, and I spent a year in <span class="country">Germany</span>, and that year convinced me that yes, that she would be the right person for me, so I came <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5038">And we got married on <span class="populated place">Mount Tamalpais</span>, on the top of <span class="populated place">Mount Tamalpais</span>, the <span class="env feature">mountain</span> I loved to hike around, and the <span class="env feature">mountain</span> we both saw every day, coming and going to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5039">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="5040">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="5041"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 8 </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5065">Q: Did they ask you about your experiences during the war at some point, or did you tell... did they know anything about your history? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5067">A: Interestingly, they were more interested then, than they are now. </sentence><sentence id="5068">As little children, they kept asking me a lot, and these days, as adults, if we meet, maybe they fear they knew... they heard everything. </sentence><sentence id="5069">But I am surprised that my sons, who are writing all the time, just as a pastime, never really ask any questions. </sentence><sentence id="5070">And they are around movies concerning the Holocaust and... back those days. </sentence><sentence id="5071">But no. </sentence><sentence id="5072">But back then yes, yes, and I told them quite a bit, and it was not really that much about the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="5073">They were too little, and I didn't want to, of course, cause nightmares, but it was mainly just life, what was life when I grew up and what I... the things I did, and they were fascinated by my accent, and they begged us to have another child, so he or she could have an accent. </sentence><sentence id="5074">They thought that a baby is going to be born with an accent. </sentence><sentence id="5075">And they laughed at my mistakes that I made, because sometimes they were really funny. </sentence><sentence id="5076">And inadvertently, I did say certain things that just sounded very strange, and still are a saying in the family. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5136">A: Yes, and the reason was, by the time we got married, the person who probably wouldn't have liked me, because he was a rabid anti-Semite, her father, was gone. </sentence><sentence id="5137">Her mother was a very tolerant person, but she was dead, too, by the time we got married. </sentence><sentence id="5138">So, the only relatives around that she had, was her brother and her sister, who are 20""-Century human beings, and they are very, very tolerant, and very progressive people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5142">Q: Okay, so you stayed in the <span class="region">Bay Area</span> until 1974, is that right? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5150">A: Oh yes. </sentence><sentence id="5151">By the time I arrived in the <span class="region">Bay Area</span>, and even before that, as soon as I could understand and speak some English, I became involved in the social and political scene very much. </sentence><sentence id="5152">For example, I remember when I... even before I settled in the <span class="region">Bay Area</span>, I would come up for the weekend and would go down, just by myself, to <span class="populated place">North Beach</span>, in <span class="populated place">San Francisco</span>, to the <span class="building">beatnik coffeehouses</span>, and just listen, or converse sometimes with people. </sentence><sentence id="5153">I really enjoyed the beatnik era. </sentence><sentence id="5154">I liked those people, they were very introspective and intelligent. </sentence><sentence id="5155">There was kind of a subdued, refined attitude about them that I appreciated. </sentence><sentence id="5156">Occasionally, when somebody played the <span class="spatial object">piano</span>, they were sipping the coffee and philosophizing, just a great time, I think, for literature, poetry reading. </sentence><sentence id="5157">They were all part of the scene. </sentence><sentence id="5158">That truly was an interesting chapter in my life, going to <span class="populated place">North Beach</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5159">Then, later on, of course, after we were married, after I came back from Europe, from my one-year stint with the Army, which was in 1966, that is when everything started, especially the Vietnam War flared up. </sentence><sentence id="5160">And our family was very much involved in that. </sentence><sentence id="5161">We were going over to the <span class="populated place">city</span>, and I remember making big signs. </sentence><sentence id="5162">My wife joined the Another Mother for Peace movement. </sentence><sentence id="5163">We were demonstrating, and there was a very cute episode that happened to us. </sentence><sentence id="5164">She usually sewed a lot for herself and for the children, and bought a very nice, flowery material to make a <span class="spatial object">dress</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5165">And we went to a big demonstration over in <span class="populated place">Berkeley</span>, and had to make our own signs. </sentence><sentence id="5166">And we were getting the <span class="spatial object">signs</span> ready and all of a sudden, we look down on our youngest son, Kevin's sign, and what did we see? </sentence><sentence id="5167">A beautiful flower, of some textile, and if we looked at it, then we realized it was her dress material that she had bought. </sentence><sentence id="5168">He was so fascinated by the pattern, and he needed flowers, because that was the theme of the demonstration, you had to have flowers on your signs, that he didn't think twice, and he was cutting out the flowers from... what... we didn't know what to do about it, and then we decided just to talk to him, that this was not really the proper thing to do, but he didn't get punished. </sentence><sentence id="5169">So that was <span class="country">Vietnam</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5170">My sister-in-law wrote to, for example, to Lyndon Johnson and told him that she fears that he should not run again. </sentence><sentence id="5171">And interestingly, about three days later, he came out and he announced that he would not run. </sentence><sentence id="5172">So that... we felt that the family can take some credit for that decision. </sentence><sentence id="5173">But, we, we tried to have our children go and learn a lot about the times where we lived in, because we realized that they were very exciting times, very unique times. </sentence><sentence id="5174">And perhaps, I always thought later on in their lives, life will be much duller than it was back then. </sentence><sentence id="5175">We also lived, by that time, in <span class="populated place">Inverness</span>, in an <span class="region">area</span> that was in the center of all these cults, and rock This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="5176">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="5177"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0 bands and so the kids were exposed to all these people and spent sometimes days, just listening to their music, up in the <span class="env feature">hills</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5178">It had advantages, it had disadvantages. </sentence><sentence id="5179">The disadvantage in this respect was that, no matter what parents would say to their children, they always had a place to go and because these rock groups had open <span class="building">house</span>, you could help yourself at the <span class="spatial object">fridge</span>, or whatever, eating, or no matter how young you were, you were also welcome to dip into the <span class="spatial object">pot</span> and smoke it. </sentence><sentence id="5180">And so it was in a... in the sense, difficult. </sentence><sentence id="5181">And many of our children in the <span class="region">area</span>, were runaways. </sentence><sentence id="5182">They would occasionally run away because that was just the style. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5218">Q: During that time, did you... were you aware of how Americans in general thought about the Holocaust and Holocaust survivors, and some of the stereotypes that were attached to them? </sentence><sentence id="5219">And did you think of yourself as a Holocaust survivor, and how were you... how were you relating to the culture at large, in terms of that kind of identity? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5222">A: Mm-hm. </sentence><sentence id="5223">Now that is a very surprising question, because I never really thought about it, but as you were asking me, I realize I didn't really think much about myself any more, as a Holocaust survivor. </sentence><sentence id="5224">I just thought much as a member of the scene, so to speak. </sentence><sentence id="5225">I was more involved in what is happening in <span class="country">America</span>, and thought more about it day by day, than to think too much, to give too much thought about the past. </sentence><sentence id="5226">So, in this respect, it was good, because one should not constantly be visited by ghosts. </sentence><sentence id="5227">So I think it, it was a good thing for me, in this respect. </sentence><sentence id="5228">And you know, I was part of the whole story then, and, rather, an American fighting to end the war, and bring justice to people who were oppressed. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5381">A: Oh, I could have stayed in <span class="country">Germany</span>, by the sheer coincidence of my name, which is a German name and the fact that I was, for a few month, a German citizen, in World War II. </sentence><sentence id="5382">And that was just for a few months, so I didn't include in any citizenship, just by a mistake and because of the strange happenings of the times. </sentence><sentence id="5383">They classified me as German in <span class="country">Hungary</span>, and temporarily we were considered Germans, and of course the whole thing was... oh, they only lasted for a few month when they found out who we were. </sentence><sentence id="5384">But that little episode and my name, and the fact that the reason the Hungarians tossed us out, besides being Jewish, they discovered that one of my great-grandparents was born in what is called <span class="region">Sudetenland</span>, which was a part of German speaking <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>, which was at that time, the <span class="country">Austro-Hungarian empire</span>, and all back, it all connects together, and it all added up to some very tragic events, because we were not considered Hungarians, and my grandfather was deported to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, not because he was Jewish, but because of they said he was a foreigner. </sentence><sentence id="5385">He could not prove that his grandfather was a Hungarian, which was not true. </sentence><sentence id="5386">But because of this, and other reasons, I could have gotten German citizenship. </sentence><sentence id="5387">I could have gotten, probably, a great deal of money that way, because of This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="5388">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="5389"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 3 what happened to my family in World War IJ, and all this, but I never had, for a second, a thought. </sentence><sentence id="5390">I mean, how can I think about settling in <span class="country">Germany</span>, and taking German citizenship?There are so many reasons why I shouldn't have done this, right? </sentence><sentence id="5391">Number one is an emotional thing, a rational thing to... that would be a little bit too much for me to bear. </sentence><sentence id="5392">Second is that I have an American family, and my wife was ready to return to the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5393">There no way would she have stayed in <span class="country">Europe</span> with me. </sentence><sentence id="5394">So, I knew that this was temporary, and I enjoyed while it lasted. </sentence><sentence id="5395">End of Tape 9, <span class="interior space">Side A</span> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="5396">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="5397"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 4 Tape 9, <span class="dlf">Side B</span> </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5421">A: I just want to say that I know that, for the purpose of the interview, you're interested in anti- Semitism and where did I run into the most, and I must say that the <span class="country">country</span> where I ran into the most anti-Semitic and Fascist remarks, and... is <span class="country">Austria</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5422">And I was amazed that the... so many years after the war, I don't see a lot of changes. </sentence><sentence id="5423">That here is a <span class="country">country</span> that, unlike <span class="country">Germany</span>, was considered a victim of Fascism, which of course, it was not, and played this role very successfully. </sentence><sentence id="5424">And today, it is just terrible. </sentence><sentence id="5425">It's, the right wing elements are all over it. </sentence><sentence id="5426">And you can go to any <span class="building">pub</span> and just wait until they have a few drinks, and there will be some talk about the good old days. </sentence><sentence id="5427">So, no, I thought <span class="country">Germany</span> dealt with the problem much, much better than <span class="country">Austria</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>

And he said, "You open your mouth, and everybody says, "Oh, what a nice accent, where are you from?"" </sentence><sentence id="5584">And he said, "I open my mouth and they say, "Hey, you are not from here, are you?" </sentence><sentence id="5585">And you know what they mean," he says, "that I'm a damn Yankee." </sentence><sentence id="5586">And I don't know about this, but all I can say is that nobody has ever reacted negatively toward my accent. </sentence><sentence id="5587">I see that sometimes people smile when I talk to them, and I know why they do it and I consider it a friendly gesture. </sentence><sentence id="5588">And that's about it. </sentence><sentence id="5589">The only people I'm really mad at, the ones who listen to me for awhile and say, "What's that?" </sentence><sentence id="5590">Because I know that they are putting me on. </sentence><sentence id="5591">That... if schoolchildren could understand me, they could, too. </sentence><sentence id="5592">But... and another thing that, of course irritates me, when... my hearing is not that good any more, and this has nothing to do with accent and all this, it's just that some people are very intolerant, and if you ask, you know, "Will you please repeat it?" </sentence><sentence id="5593">They just say, "Forget it." </sentence><sentence id="5594">And the word forget it really irritates me. </sentence><sentence id="5595">But that has nothing to do with accent and being foreign born. </sentence><sentence id="5596">Otherwise, I find that people are much friendlier, even with my reservations about being suspicious, much friendlier than they were in some other <span class="region">states</span> that I've travelled. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5618">A: No, I don't do it any more, and frankly, I can't even come up with a good reason why. </sentence><sentence id="5619">Perhaps it's just that I get very busy at <span class="building">home</span>, and the... somehow, the familiar faces that I knew, many of them left and I... it's very difficult, I think, after a certain age, to make friends and to build kind of a circle around yourself. </sentence><sentence id="5620">And also when I first joined, the <span class="building">Historical Society</span> was a lot more vital than it is now. </sentence><sentence id="5621">I think it just settled into a routine life, and it just... 1 was just not interested any more. </sentence><sentence id="5622">The <span class="building">museum</span> was established, it's running smoothly. </sentence><sentence id="5623">I don't think they really need me there any more. </sentence><sentence id="5624">So I rather concentrate on the <span class="building">Master Gardener's Association</span>, where I can do something, actually work. </sentence><sentence id="5625">I am always much happier when I can do physical work, than when I just sit around and talk about what to do. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5880">A: I consider this very similar to what was going on in <span class="country">Germany</span> while we lived there. </sentence><sentence id="5881"><span class="country">Germany</span> had an economic boom in the 1950's, just like we have now, which meant that the... all the menial and dirty jobs were unfilled. </sentence><sentence id="5882">Most Germans just wouldn't want to work in that, and also that they needed more workers than the <span class="country">country</span> actually could produce. </sentence><sentence id="5883">So they invited in other nationalities as guest workers, that's what they were called, and they were mainly from <span class="country">Turkey</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5884">And this was back in the 50's. </sentence><sentence id="5885">The German economic miracle produced a migration from <span class="country">Turkey</span>, which was legal, completely legal. </sentence><sentence id="5886">They had to have documents, they entered, they went to work in the <span class="building">factories</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5887">Now, today, in 1993... 1999, the economy... the German economy has slowed down considerably. </sentence><sentence id="5888">These Turkish workers, the original Turkish workers, today are grandparents. </sentence><sentence id="5889">They brought their children back then, it was allowed, which was, I think, a very nice, humanitarian gesture, because <span class="country">Switzerland</span>, who had the same problem, did not allow family members to follow. </sentence><sentence id="5890">They could go <span class="building">home</span> on vacation, send the money back, but nobody was allowed to... allowed to come. </sentence><sentence id="5891">So, the family members came, and you know, one family member then brings another family member, and pretty soon... I think today there are close to three million Turks living in <span class="country">Germany</span>, a country of sixty-five million people. </sentence><sentence id="5892">That's quite a bit, and of course, was tremendous resentment by some people to begin with. </sentence><sentence id="5893">But the real problem came not while the economic boom was on, the real problem came when it was over, because now you had a lot of people who were already adults, and born in <span class="country">Germany</span>, to Turkish parents, and all the rest. </sentence><sentence id="5894">So now, here came the problem of what to do with them. </sentence><sentence id="5895">Are they citizens, are they not citizens? </sentence><sentence id="5896">And welfare, are they qualified for welfare? </sentence><sentence id="5897">So, I am afraid of the same thing here. </sentence><sentence id="5898">Right now, especially around here, in the <span class="region">Bluegrass</span>, everybody who can think, knows that these illegal... or legal Mexican workers are fulfilling an important job. </sentence><sentence id="5899">They are working here in a job that most other people wouldn't take. </sentence><sentence id="5900">So, nobody has great reservations. </sentence><sentence id="5901">When they see...
