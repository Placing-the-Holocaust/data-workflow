<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="91">A: Yeah, well, it started with <span class="populated place">Povorsk</span>. </sentence><sentence id="92">A -- I -- I was not there when the tragedy happened. </sentence><sentence id="93">I was in the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span>, working a <span class="dlf">coal mine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="94">And I found out about -- I knew -- I -- I -- the Soviet -- I -- read the Soviet press, even though I worked for a <span class="populated place">slave labor camp</span>, we had a cultural life. </sentence><sentence id="95">There were -- there was a <span class="building">library</span> with papers and books which you could read. </sentence><sentence id="96">As a matter of fact, I ha -- even had the privilege of subscribing for -- to -- to the <span class="building">Pravda</span>, one of the Soviet papers, for a short while, for a few months, because the librarian, who was also a internee like myself, had about half a dozen papers he could give, to give us a semblance of kind of freedom and culture. </sentence><sentence id="97">So, he gave me the privilege of sur-surpri -- which was dirt cheap, it was pennies. </sentence><sentence id="98">But, to me it had a big value besides reading it, I could read it in the <span class="building">library</span>. </sentence><sentence id="99">But I could sell it afterward

if you had money, you could buy things. </sentence><sentence id="106">They used to bring in milk, he used to bring in tobacco, which was sold by the glass. </sentence><sentence id="107">Actually, that was not even tobacco, it was tobacco roots, which were chopped up with an ax and you rolled it in newspaper. </sentence><sentence id="108">Now, once a mon -- once a week, I used to sell my bread ration in this commerce in -- intercamp commerce -- intracamp commerce, and buy tobacco. </sentence><sentence id="109">But I had to buy a newspaper. </sentence><sentence id="110">A <span class="spatial object">newspaper</span> cost 10 rubles. </sentence><sentence id="111">So, when I had five newspapers or six newspapers a week, I could sell five of them and one use for my own needs and with others I used to get the 50 rubles and use it to buy the tobacco roots, see? </sentence><sentence id="112">So, while I had it, I was in very good shape, financially. </sentence><sentence id="113">I didn't have to sell my bread ration. </sentence><sentence id="114">So -- and in the <span class="building">press</span>, there wasn't much about the Final Solution. </sentence><sentence id="115">The <span class="building">Soviet press</span> didn't write much about it, they wrote about atrocities committed against the Soviet people, none that mentioned Jews. </sentence><sentence id="116">Of course the particular Jews [indecipherable] designed to be exterminated. </sentence><sentence id="117">But -- And they knew about it, of course, but they didn't -- I remember when the revolt broke out in the <span class="populated place">Warsaw ghetto</span>, there was a little <span class="spatial object">column</span>, one <span class="spatial object">column</span>, but about four or five inches tall, about a revolt in the <span class="populated place">Warsaw ghetto</span>, which was liquidated by -- the <span class="populated place">Warsaw ghetto</span> was liquidated by the German -- the German occupiers. </sentence><sentence id="118">Not mentioning much about just one word to the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="119">The <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, of course, they had to mention the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, because there's only one kind of a <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, a <span class="populated place">Jewish ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="120">So they mentioned it. </sentence><sentence id="121">So there wasn't much about it. </sentence><sentence id="122">But one day, when the forces -- the Soviet forces approached not far from where my <span class="populated place">town</span> was located, I wrote a letter from <span class="populated place">camp</span> to the -- somebody in the ci -- <span class="building">town council</span>, asking if This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="123">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or

information about my family. </sentence><sentence id="125">It so happened that the <span class="populated place">town</span> was not liberated yet. </sentence><sentence id="126">It was still -- there was still the -- the -- the front was there in the -- the next <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="127">For quite awhile, places changed hands back and forth, but I -- another <span class="populated place">town</span> close to it, was already liberated. </sentence><sentence id="128">And a friend of mine, who was a former partisan, where my brother was also a partisan of the sa -- the same place, the same time. </sentence><sentence id="129">He was already liberated and he was working in the <span class="building">post office</span>. </sentence><sentence id="130">And when they saw my name -- my return address, with my name on it, he opened the letter and he sent it to my brother. </sentence><sentence id="131">He read it, sent to my brother and my brother answered it. </sentence><sentence id="132">And he -- he just wrote me that he is -- he knows that he -- he is -- he is alive, everything is -- all is well. </sentence><sentence id="133">He works now as -- doing -- as a guard in an NKVD, secret -- secret police farm. </sentence><sentence id="134">And he sent me -- he would sent me some money. </sentence><sentence id="135">Course, they used to speculate theirselves by [indecipherable] and he knew that I was in bad shape, so he send me some money. </sentence><sentence id="136">A few days later, I got a letter from one of my friend -- a former brother-in-law of mine, as a matter of fact, and then his brother, describing what happened and how it happened and who survived and did not survive. </sentence><sentence id="137">So I knew -- then I find out what happened. </sentence><sentence id="138">And I had in mind that my wi -- in 1945, after the war, the Poles and the Soviets conclude an agreement to let -- this ha -- by the way, this information is in the videotape, but I'm telling you so you understand what I am talking about -- had an agreement to let all of those who were former Polish citizens, til "39, coo -- provided they are Jews or Poles, not Ukrainians or Russians, could get out, back to <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="139">And after a year, they find -- this is a long story, but doesn't make any sense, it repeats again. </sentence><sentence id="140">I left the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span>, you know, and then came to <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="141">But, I This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="142">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="143"> ontectnetonancedjusietneey for ther biormatierabouttfisenecion USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0027 7 ha -- I thought I'Il be able to go by this <span class="populated place">town</span> and see what -- you know, where the place was, at least, fo-found out what happened. </sentence><sentence id="144">But luckily, luckily, I could not stop there, because th-they routed me through a different way, through <span class="country">Belarus</span>, through <span class="populated place">Minsk</span> and - - but I always dreamed about coming back to <span class="populated place">Povorsk</span> and putting up a <span class="building">monument</span>, which was impossible during Soviet days. </sentence><sentence id="145">First of all, they didn't allow any <span class="spatial object">monuments</span> which specifically said Jews perished there. </sentence><sentence id="146">Soviet citizens, yes, but not Jews. </sentence><sentence id="147">So, i-in -- in -- and at that time, this -- this was a very dangerous place to be, because Ukrainian nationalists already harassed the Soviet army and killed the Jews, just like the Poles did after the war, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="148">So, is good that they did not go through. </sentence><sentence id="149">But I -- I -- It was a kind of - - became an obsession for me to come and put up a <span class="spatial object">monument</span>. </sentence><sentence id="150">Now, when you co -- then they st -- they started allowing already do -- before Gorbachov's time already, they start allowing put up with and even in Yiddish or in Hebrew, what happened -- descriptions on these <span class="building">monuments</span>, and they allowed to have Jews. </sentence><sentence id="151">I don't know if you know about that pol -- a Soviet write up of the name of Viefter Schenko, who wrote a poem about, "There's no <span class="building">monument</span> in <span class="populated place">Babier</span>," which is <span class="populated place">Kiev</span> -- probably heard about it. </sentence><sentence id="152">And he wrote he's ashamed being a Russian, that they did not allow to put up <span class="spatial object">m-monuments</span> in these places, so they did allow, finally they did allow. </sentence><sentence id="153">And then, in the beg -- middle of this decade, since "95, I think, <span class="country">Ukraine</span> became independent and they allowed, already. </sentence><sentence id="154">And there was a fellow in our -- in -- in the -- in the <span class="region">province</span> there, who, as a matter of fact, he's -- he -- he was the -- the -- the secretary of the Communist party in the -- in the -- yeah, he was half Jewish, too, but he didn't -- he said himself Ukrainian. </sentence><sentence id="155">And he This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="156">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="157"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0027 8 started putting up this <span class="spatial object">monument</span> with government help, first Soviet and then the independent <span class="country">Ukraine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="158">I got in touch with him, I found out there is in <span class="country">Israel</span> a organization, it's called the <span class="building">House of Waleen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="159"><span class="populated place">Waleen</span> is the name of the <span class="region">province</span> which has records of many. </sentence><sentence id="160">There's probably, in that part, hundreds of thousands of Jews perished. </sentence><sentence id="161">They didn't send them to -- to <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>, they killed them right then and there. </sentence><sentence id="162">In our <span class="populated place">town</span>, it was exploded dump, <span class="building">oil dump</span> that the Soviets built and they exploded it and then they used it for when they killed th-the German [indecipherable] they dump the Jews in there, you know. </sentence><sentence id="163">And this is the place -- so it was a <span class="region">military zone</span>, belonged to the army. </sentence><sentence id="164">And you could not go into any place in army during Soviet days. </sentence><sentence id="165">They agreed they" Il let us put up the <span class="spatial object">monument</span>. </sentence><sentence id="166">We -- We -- We a-agreed on a price with -- how much it'll cost. </sentence><sentence id="167">But it came the day when they're supposed -- already the <span class="building">monument</span> is ready and they decided nyet, they're not allowed to on the mili-military. </sentence><sentence id="168">So, I -- finally it was ready, we are ready to go in 19 -- in 19 -- this was what, 60, now is 90 -- 98 and 96.95, we had a date and I
