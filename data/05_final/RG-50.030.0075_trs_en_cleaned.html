<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="18">A: I was born in a small <span class="populated place">town</span> called <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> -- a country called <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>, in a small <span class="populated place">town</span> called <span class="populated place">Klyucharki</span>, which was near a <span class="populated place">city</span> called <span class="populated place">Munkacs</span>. </sentence><sentence id="19">They were like, I don't know, maybe 20 kilometers from the "big <span class="populated place">city</span>" called <span class="populated place">Munkacs</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="22">Q: What can you tell us of life in the <span class="populated place">city</span>, as far back as you can remember? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="24">A: I came from a small <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="25">There were not many Jewish families in our <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="26">We were maybe a handful. </sentence><sentence id="27">I was a child, and I don't -- I, I couldn't tell you how many. </sentence><sentence id="28">But it was a close-knit <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="29">Prior to the war, I personally didn't -- I did not feel any antisemitism directed towards me or my family. </sentence><sentence id="30">As far as I remember, we lived in peace with our neighbors. </sentence><sentence id="31">My friends were not Jewish as well as Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="32">In fact, my very best friend was not Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="33">She was a young lady, a young girl my age, who used to sleep in our <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="34">We would share a <span class="spatial object">bed</span>, many times, and -- as I would sleep in her <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="35">And I, I personally never felt any antisemitism directly towards me, or directly towards my family. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="48">Q: What kind of work did your father do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="50">A: My dad came to this <span class="country">country</span> just before the war broke out. </sentence><sentence id="51">Our families were farmers mostly. </sentence><sentence id="52">And I don't really recall. </sentence><sentence id="53">I think he was, he was an owner of a <span class="building">store</span> -- <span class="building">clothing store</span>, prior to coming to -- his coming to this <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="54">I don't really remember him. </sentence><sentence id="55">To tell you the truth, when I came to this <span class="country">country</span>, I came to my -- I had very few memories of my father. </sentence><sentence id="56">He was like -- it was like coming to a stranger. </sentence><sentence id="57">You know? </sentence><sentence id="58">So I really don't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="68">Q: And when your mother was looking after you, when you were growing up as a small child, could you tell us whether she looked after you alone? </sentence><sentence id="69">Or were there others in the  family? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="72">A: Well, we had -- my grandmother lived in <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="73">And, of course, I had uncles and my aunt. </sentence><sentence id="74">And we did have family. </sentence><sentence id="75">There were some cousins. </sentence><sentence id="76">We were very fond of our grandmother, and I spent a lot of time there; and my mother also had her parents, who lived in another <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="77">And so she had support from both families, both on her husband's side and on her, her own parents" side. </sentence><sentence id="78">But after my dad came to this <span class="country">country</span>, he used to help us. </sentence><sentence id="79">When my dad came to this <span class="country">country</span>, it was right after, I believe, the Depression. </sentence><sentence id="80">And he came to <span class="populated place">Chicago</span>, and earned three dollars a week working for <span class="building">Vienna Sausage Company</span> in <span class="populated place">Chicago</span>. </sentence><sentence id="81">And the story went that my dad would send us a dollar and a half to live on in Europe -- which was a lot of money at that time in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="82">And, of course, he lived on a dollar and a half here. </sentence><sentence id="83">And when my dad came here, immigration was very strict. </sentence><sentence id="84">In those days, a man had to show that he could support a family before he was allowed to bring a family to this <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="85">And I believe there's a long story behind this, but by the time my dad was able to send us papers to immigrate to this <span class="country">country</span>, the war had broken out. </sentence><sentence id="86">And my mother was afraid to take her family. </sentence><sentence id="87">I had two younger brothers; and my mother was afraid to take three children on a <span class="spatial object">ship</span> that might have been bombed on the <span class="env feature">waters</span>, that were beginning to be bombed already because the war had broken out. </sentence><sentence id="88">I, I believe this is the joke of, of the century: her being afraid to take us on a <span class="spatial object">boat</span> that might be bombed, and then getting caught in the war in Europe and <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="89">You know? </sentence><sentence id="90">So.... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="110">Q: As you speak of the war beginning, could you tell us what your first impressions were of the beginning of the war? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="112">A: The first -- okay. </sentence><sentence id="113">The first that I really knew that Jews were being persecuted in <span class="country">Europe</span> was as a child. </sentence><sentence id="114">I recall my mother taking us -- meaning my brothers, my two brothers and herself -- going to my grandfather's <span class="populated place">town</span> where my grandparents lived, where my mother was born and came from. </sentence><sentence id="115">And she took us there, often times, for visits. </sentence><sentence id="116">And, I believe, in 1939 when the Germans took away citizenship from the Polish Jews that emigrated to <span class="country">Germany</span>, became German citizens, established <span class="building">businesses</span> in <span class="country">Germany</span> and fought for the German government. </sentence><sentence id="117">These Jews were asked to leave <span class="country">Germany</span> when Hitler came into power. </sentence><sentence id="118">He took away their <span class="building">businesses</span>, as you well know; and he took -- confiscated everything they had, and sent them back over the <span class="dlf">border</span> to <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="119">When these Jews came to <span class="country">Poland</span>, they had no place to go. </sentence><sentence id="120">They had no <span class="building">homes</span>; and of course the <span class="populated place">Polish community</span> did not want these Jews back. </sentence><sentence id="121">So a lot of the Jews were being persecuted, and a lot of them went into the <span class="region">mountain areas</span>. </sentence><sentence id="122">My grandparents lived close to the <span class="dlf">Polish border</span> in <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>; and, of course, in -- near the <span class="env feature">mountains</span>. </sentence><sentence id="123"> I recall, as a child, these Jews coming down from the <span class="env feature">mountains</span> looking for <span class="building">Jewish homes</span>; and begging for food, begging for warm clothing and so forth, to take back to their families in hiding. </sentence><sentence id="124">I recall, as a child, helping my grandfather; taking <span class="spatial object">buckets</span>, pretending we were going to feed the animals, and going into the <span class="building">barns</span> for whatever reason. </sentence><sentence id="125">And carrying food and warm clothing in these <span class="spatial object">buckets</span> to take back to these people, so that they could take it back to their families. </sentence><sentence id="126">I recall hearing horror stories of Jews being persecuted in <span class="country">Poland</span> and in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="127">Of course, we didn't know about <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span> at that time. </sentence><sentence id="128">But we knew -- I knew, as a child, that Jews were being persecuted. </sentence><sentence id="129">And I recall hiding many of these young Jewish people that would come; and putting them into <span class="spatial object">wagons</span> and covering them with straw and whatever, and taking them into different parts of <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>, to different <span class="populated place">towns</span>. </sentence><sentence id="130">So that we could help these young Jews escape. </sentence><sentence id="131">We still had freedom at that time, and little did we know that we were going to be next. </sentence><sentence id="132">That we were going to be persecuted. </sentence><sentence id="133">So I did know at that time that Jews were being persecuted. </sentence><sentence id="134">But we still lived in peace with our neighbors. </sentence><sentence id="135">We, as I said, were not being persecuted at that time. </sentence><sentence id="136">Our life was peaceful. </sentence><sentence id="137">The businessmen did or went about their business as they pleased. </sentence><sentence id="138">And that was my first recollection. </sentence><sentence id="139">Then I recall going back <span class="building">home</span> to our <span class="populated place">hometown</span> in Czecho- in <span class="populated place">Klyucharki</span>. </sentence><sentence id="140">And I had a young uncle that must have been 17, 18 years old at the time; and as <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> was being occupied, this uncle pretended he was going to take eggs and things off of the <span class="dlf">farm</span> to go into the big <span class="populated place">city</span> of <span class="populated place">Munkacs</span>. </sentence><sentence id="141">He would take these things and put them in a <span class="spatial object">basket</span> on his <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> and pedal to the <span class="populated place">city</span>; strictly to find out about what was happening in the <span class="populated place">city</span>, what was happening around the world, so to speak. </sentence><sentence id="142">Because that was the only news we could really get. </sentence><sentence id="143">We didn't have <span class="spatial object">television</span> and we didn't have radio, as they do today. </sentence><sentence id="144">And my uncle used to come back and bring us bits and pieces of news. </sentence><sentence id="145">We were not allowed to listen to this news, we as children. </sentence><sentence id="146">We were being protected. </sentence><sentence id="147">And we were just -- we were getting bits and pieces of this. </sentence><sentence id="148">So I did know that in certain <span class="region">areas</span> Jews, because they were Jews, they were being persecuted. </sentence><sentence id="149">But we ourselves were not touched by it at that point. </sentence><sentence id="150">Actually, I personally was not affected by this until Hitler marched into <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> and took over the <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="190">Q: Do you remember that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="192">A: My first recollection was when I went to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="193">The night before going to <span class="building">school</span>, my friend who was not Jewish -- she and I slept in our <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="194">Slept in the same <span class="spatial object">bed</span>, played as children do. </sentence><sentence id="195">I remember my mother opening the <span class="dlf">door</span> and telling us to go to sleep, because we were being noisy and the next day was <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="196">She and I got up in the morning to go to <span class="building">school</span>, one morning. </sentence><sentence id="197">When we came to <span class="building">school</span>, she was allowed to walk in and the <span class="dlf">door</span> was closed to me. </sentence><sentence id="198">I was told I was not allowed to walk into <span class="building">class</span> anymore. </sentence><sentence id="199">I needed to go <span class="building">home</span>, because I was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="200">A teacher who was my teacher, who took out a white handkerchief from his pocket the week before to wipe a smudge off of my face, turned to me one day and told  me I must not come to <span class="building">school</span> anymore. </sentence><sentence id="201">All of a sudden, for whatever reason, I needed to go back <span class="building">home</span> and not come back to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="202">I remember going <span class="building">home</span> and crying, and not understanding why I was not allowed to go to <span class="building">school</span> anymore. </sentence><sentence id="203">A few minutes later, my two brothers came <span class="building">home</span> crying. </sentence><sentence id="204">They too were sent back <span class="building">home</span>, and were told not to go to <span class="building">school</span> anymore. </sentence><sentence id="205">Because we became quote "Jewish" overnight. </sentence><sentence id="206">My mother had to sit down with us and tell us the facts of life. </sentence><sentence id="207">Tell us why we were not allowed to go to <span class="building">school</span> anymore; tell us that the <span class="country">country</span> was invaded by a man called Hitler who was a bad man. </sentence><sentence id="208">We did not know about the killings at that time -- at least, I didn't. </sentence><sentence id="209">But we were told that there were certain rules we needed to follow from now on, and one was not to go to <span class="building">public school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="210">I recall the laws being set down one by one. </sentence><sentence id="211">Not being able to go to a <span class="building">grocery store</span>, except during certain hours. </sentence><sentence id="212">Not being able to work our <span class="dlf">farms</span> anymore. </sentence><sentence id="213">Not being able to walk into a <span class="building">bakery</span> anymore, except during certain hours. </sentence><sentence id="214">Not to go into a <span class="dlf">park</span> and sit on a <span class="spatial object">bench</span>, unless it said, "For Jews Only." </sentence><sentence id="215">The wearing of the yellow star. </sentence><sentence id="216">And the hours we were allowed to be out, and the hours we were -- has to be back in the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="217">And those were the first that I personally felt. </sentence><sentence id="218">And then, of course, the laws that came down one by one. </sentence><sentence id="219">Everyday there was a new law, and everyday we had to obey the new law. </sentence><sentence id="220">And we were not allowed to walk down the <span class="dlf">street</span> anymore. </sentence><sentence id="221">If someone came towards us that was not a Jew, the Jew needed to step off the <span class="dlf">sidewalk</span> to allow the next person -- who of course was not Jewish -- to walk by. </sentence><sentence id="222">I recall our neighbors turning their backs on us. </sentence><sentence id="223">Spitting on us. </sentence><sentence id="224">Neighbors who lived in peace with us, who were our friends the week before. </sentence><sentence id="225">And then, of course, we were lucky we were farmers; because we would have starved to death. </sentence><sentence id="226">You know, it's interesting. </sentence><sentence id="227">You, you sit and, and you talk, and as you sat and memories came back. </sentence><sentence id="228">It took me many, many years to find out why my mother would put food on the <span class="spatial object">table</span> for her three children at night, give us our dinner, and after she served us, she would walk out of the <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="229">She never stayed in the <span class="interior space">room</span> where we ate. </sentence><sentence id="230">I could never understand this. </sentence><sentence id="231">Just recently -- shows you how smart I am -- I've just recently figured this out. </sentence><sentence id="232">I probably had forgotten all of this. </sentence><sentence id="233">The reason she didn't stay with us was because there wasn't enough food to go around. </sentence><sentence id="234">So those are my early memories of Hitler walking into <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="235">And, of course, then there was the knock on the <span class="dlf">door</span> in the middle of the night. </sentence><sentence id="236">We were told to gather our belongings, take warm clothes, take our valuables, and to take our pots and pans. </sentence><sentence id="237">We were told we were going to be relocated. </sentence><sentence id="238">And as we know today, they lied. </sentence><sentence id="239">And we believed. </sentence><sentence id="240">I'm not sure if our parents knew what was going to happen or not. </sentence><sentence id="241">But we believed. </sentence><sentence id="242">I think we needed to believe. </sentence><sentence id="243">And, of course, as we know how brave Hitler was -- the knock came in the middle of the night. </sentence><sentence id="244">It was the last days of Passover when they came to get us, and they told us to take whatever food we could. </sentence><sentence id="245">We didn't have bread in the <span class="building">house</span> yet. </sentence><sentence id="246">We still had matzo. </sentence><sentence id="247">I remember my mother packing matzo to take with us to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="248">It seems like yesterday. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="306">Q: You mentioned to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="307">Was the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> in the <span class="populated place">town</span> or did they transport you? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="308">A: In our case a <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was in a small -- in our small <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="309">The Germans took over the <span class="building">grammar school</span>, a small <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="310">They emptied the <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="311">They put a <span class="dlf">fence</span> around the <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="312">They brought soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="313">They brought dogs. </sentence><sentence id="314">For some reason, always dogs. </sentence><sentence id="315">And the guards, of course. </sentence><sentence id="316">And they put us into this <span class="building">school</span> -- which became our <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="317">All the Jewish family from the -- families from this <span class="populated place">community</span> were put into this <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="318">We slept on the <span class="interior space">floor</span>. </sentence><sentence id="319">We had our <span class="spatial object">bedding</span>, because we brought it with us. </sentence><sentence id="320">We were not abused while we were in this so-called <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="321">Food was brought to us every day. </sentence><sentence id="322">We didn't have an over-abundance of food, but we were not starving. </sentence><sentence id="323">Of course, our neighbors did not come to see us, nor did they come to ask if we needed any food or any help. </sentence><sentence id="324">I will never understand that part. </sentence><sentence id="325">I will never understand how one human being -- a neighbor, a friend -- can turn against you. </sentence><sentence id="326">A person that has lived with you in peace, that has watched you born, that has gone to <span class="building">school</span> with you, knows your family and knows your life history, can turn against you as a human being. </sentence><sentence id="327">But nevertheless, that's what they did. </sentence><sentence id="328">The Germans would come -- the soldiers would come every day to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="350">They would take our young people on a work crew -- I was too young, but they would take most of the young people -- and they would take them to do forced labor. </sentence><sentence id="351">Whatever they did, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="352">There were different jobs for all the young men, as well as women. </sentence><sentence id="353">They would tell us that they would bring them back at night; and in most cases, most of them did come back at night. </sentence><sentence id="354">The ones that didn't, we were told that they were sent to a different <span class="region">area</span> but we would see them in some future time. </sentence><sentence id="355">Of course, we never did. </sentence><sentence id="356">And this is how we lived for several weeks. </sentence><sentence id="357">We -- the families stayed together; and we could have lived that way, very well. </sentence><sentence id="358">We would not have had all of the comforts of <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="359">But if they would have let us, we could have survived in that type of an atmosphere. </sentence><sentence id="360">Until the <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> came to empty out the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>; and, of course, to take us to the famous <span class="spatial object">trains</span>. </sentence><sentence id="361">When they came to empty the <span class="populated place">ghettos</span>, again they told us we were going to be relocated. </sentence><sentence id="362">I had two younger brothers, of which one was nine and one was seven. </sentence><sentence id="363">When they came to take us on to the <span class="spatial object">trucks</span>, as we were walking on to towards the <span class="spatial object">trucks</span>, my youngest brother turned back and ran back into the <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="364">He would not come out. </sentence><sentence id="365">He hid underneath a <span class="spatial object">table</span>. </sentence><sentence id="366">They carried him out, bodily, and threw him on to this <span class="spatial object">truck</span> as he was kicking and crying, as if he knew where he was going to go. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="728">Q: As you struggle to remember and help us to know, can you share with us some of your impressions of what you saw and how you reacted to it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="730">A: I think the, the reaction is -- I think the first thought is, to survive. </sentence><sentence id="731">Your concern for your family. </sentence><sentence id="732">Your wondering what happened to them. </sentence><sentence id="733">The people around you. </sentence><sentence id="734">The seeing of death day in and day out. </sentence><sentence id="735">Not knowing when your turn was going to come. </sentence><sentence id="736">But I think the struggle to survive, in all of us. </sentence><sentence id="737">And, and none of us really know the kind of energy we put in every day to survive, unless we're faced with this. </sentence><sentence id="738">And I know many people thought of dying, and many people thought of committing suicide. </sentence><sentence id="739">My thought was always of tomorrow. </sentence><sentence id="740">And I believe that's what -- maybe youth -- but my, my hope was always of tomorrow. </sentence><sentence id="741">The struggles to survive. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="754">Q: You mentioned the word "selection." </sentence><sentence id="755">Could you tell us a little about that process? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="758">A: Selection. </sentence><sentence id="759">We needed to get undressed every day. </sentence><sentence id="760">And we needed to run -- not walk -- in  0 front of Dr. Mengele, or his entourage, which was SS soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="761">We needed to show that we still had strength left to -- whether it was to work or to live another day. </sentence><sentence id="762">I recall some women were beginning -- as the hair grows back, they were beginning to get gray hair. </sentence><sentence id="763">And they would go and take a little piece of coal from one of the <span class="spatial object">pot-bellied stoves</span> that was in a <span class="building">barrack</span>. </sentence><sentence id="764">And they would use this coal to color their hair with, so that they would look a little younger. </sentence><sentence id="765">I mean, one grayed at the age of maybe 18 or 19 under those conditions. </sentence><sentence id="766">And they would run -- we would run in front of whoever it was that was doing the selections, to show that we could survive one other day. </sentence><sentence id="767">If one had a scar, a pimple, if one didn't run fast enough, if one didn't look right for whatever reason to the particular person that was doing the selection. </sentence><sentence id="768">They would stand there with a stick -- to the right or to the left -- as you ran by them. </sentence><sentence id="769">One never knew if they were in the good <span class="dlf">line</span> or the bad <span class="dlf">line</span>. </sentence><sentence id="770">One <span class="dlf">line</span> would go to the <span class="interior space">gas chambers</span>. </sentence><sentence id="771">The other <span class="dlf">line</span> would go back to the <span class="populated place">camp</span> and to the <span class="building">barracks</span>, to live another day. </sentence><sentence id="772">This is how the selection was done. </sentence><sentence id="773">I believe there were so many people that needed to be gassed every day. </sentence><sentence id="774">And we knew the <span class="spatial object">trains</span> were coming in; and we watched the people marching. </sentence><sentence id="775">And we knew many of the <span class="building">barracks</span> were being emptied out, day in and day out, to make <span class="interior space">room</span> for the new people that were coming in. </sentence><sentence id="776">We never knew when our turn would come next. </sentence><sentence id="777">So one always lived in fear, and one always tried to get through these selections for one more day. </sentence><sentence id="778">And, of course, the <span class="building">Appell</span>. </sentence><sentence id="779">They would wake us up at the crack of dawn and empty out the entire <span class="building">barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="780">And we would need to line up in fives to be counted, twice a day -- the first thing in the morning and the last thing at night. </sentence><sentence id="781">To make sure no one had escaped, no one was missing. </sentence><sentence id="782">Sometimes we would stand there for hours and hours. </sentence><sentence id="783">Just stand to be counted, until every single person in the particular <span class="populated place">camp</span> was accounted for. </sentence><sentence id="784">You must remember, there were thousands and thousands of people in each <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="785">Whether it rained or the sun was out, if it was hot or if it was cold. </sentence><sentence id="786">We had very little clothing. </sentence><sentence id="787">And, of course, in the summer we had to wear whatever we had. </sentence><sentence id="788">So if the <span class="env feature">sun</span> would beat down on you, many people would faint during these "Appell" counts. </sentence><sentence id="789">Nobody ever wanted to be at the beginning of the <span class="dlf">line</span>, and nobody ever wanted to be at the front of the <span class="dlf">line</span>; because for whatever punishment was being dished out, they would pull people from the beginning or the end of the <span class="dlf">line</span> to punish these people. </sentence><sentence id="790">To show us what would happen to us if we did not obey orders in every day living. </sentence><sentence id="791">And, of course, the dead people that that would die during the night from starvation or disease, or from killing, from beatings, they too would need to be carried out from the <span class="building">barracks</span> every single morning, and lined up in front of the <span class="building">barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="792">They, too needed, to be counted. </sentence><sentence id="793">Every single body needed to be accounted for. </sentence><sentence id="794">Day in, and day out. </sentence><sentence id="795">We would not get any food until every single person was accounted for. </sentence><sentence id="796">And then we were allowed to march and get our breakfast, which often times just consisted of a cup of coffee. </sentence><sentence id="797">Often times they would give us a little soup and a small slice of bread. </sentence><sentence id="798">And most of the time, of course, we didn't have any <span class="env feature">water</span>. </sentence><sentence id="799">So we would use that hot coffee to wash our faces and our hands with. </sentence><sentence id="800">So we wouldn't even get the hot coffee in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="801">This was our existence while we were in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="802">My job in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> was -- they would line us up  1 every morning and they would take us outside; and we would carry huge rocks from one <span class="region">side</span> to another. </sentence><sentence id="803">One day we would come, and we would take these huge <span class="env feature">rocks</span> from this side and we would carry them to that <span class="region">side</span>. </sentence><sentence id="804">The next day, they would bring us back;

and the shutter would close after. </sentence><sentence id="939">And we would all pounce on this potato or this -- whatever this piece of food was that came at us. </sentence><sentence id="940">And, of course, they would shoot at us;

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1093">A: When we heard that <span class="country">Russia</span> had occupied the particular <span class="populated place">town</span> we were liberated in, we went to them and presented ourselves as prisoners, as they could see, because we were skin and bones, and of course our hair had not grown back in the few days, and we were still in uniform. </sentence><sentence id="1094">We joined other survivors. </sentence><sentence id="1095">They took us to an <span class="region">area</span> where they had other survivors that they had liberated. </sentence><sentence id="1096">And then the Russians took us into a <span class="populated place">town</span>, where they took over an <span class="building">apartment building</span>; and they put us all into this <span class="building">building</span> and literally made it like a <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> type of a surrounding. </sentence><sentence id="1097">Although they did give us all the medical attention we needed, and they did give us food and they gave us a <span class="interior space">bath</span> and they gave clothing. </sentence><sentence id="1098">They had to put guards around us, because they were afraid we were carriers of disease at that point, as probably we were. </sentence><sentence id="1099">Most of us were sick. </sentence><sentence id="1100">And they -- as I said they put guards there; and they put they put wires on the <span class="dlf">windows</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1101">But they did -- we were given freedom at that point. </sentence><sentence id="1102">And I think the, the <span class="dlf">windows</span> and so forth were being protected -- we, we were given the protection from their soldiers at that point, more than anything. </sentence><sentence id="1103">Because we were women; and, of course, you know, the protection we needed. </sentence><sentence id="1104">After that, after we had medical attention and all, they had asked us where we wanted to go. </sentence><sentence id="1105">And I chose to go back <span class="building">home</span> to my <span class="populated place">hometown</span>, hoping that someone from my family had survived and would come back <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1106"> 4 I was one of the first to come back <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1107">And when we came -- when I came back to our <span class="populated place">town</span>, our <span class="building">home</span> was destroyed. </sentence><sentence id="1108">Soldiers had used it as a <span class="building">lookout post</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1109">It was kind of on a <span class="env feature">hill</span>, and they could see different directions from it. </sentence><sentence id="1110">So it was totally destroyed. </sentence><sentence id="1111">My grandmother's <span class="building">home</span> still stood. </sentence><sentence id="1112">There were no <span class="dlf">windows</span>, but the <span class="building">home</span> was intact. </sentence><sentence id="1113">And I moved into that <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1114">And we had a <span class="spatial object">train</span> that would pass by our <span class="populated place">village</span> once a day. </sentence><sentence id="1115">And I would go to meet that <span class="spatial object">train</span> every day, to see if someone else had survived. </sentence><sentence id="1116">And little by little, some of our young people started to trickle back, one by one. </sentence><sentence id="1117">And my grandmother's <span class="building">home</span> became the gathering place for all of us. </sentence><sentence id="1118">We all moved in. </sentence><sentence id="1119">We had what you call communal living; except that we did it out of necessity, "cause we had nothing else. </sentence><sentence id="1120">And we all migrated to this one <span class="building">home</span>, and lived off of potatoes and carrots or whatever we could get off the <span class="dlf">fields</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1121">Our neighbors did not come to offer us anything. </sentence><sentence id="1122">Our neighbors -- who used our <span class="spatial object">furniture</span>, who used my aunt's clothes and my mother's clothes, that we recognized -- not once came to ask if we needed any food or warm clothing. </sentence><sentence id="1123">I like to think that it was done out of shame, maybe out of guilt. </sentence><sentence id="1124">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1125">I like to think that this is why they never came forth. </sentence><sentence id="1126">And we all lived that way until we all went in our different directions. </sentence></p></dialogue>
