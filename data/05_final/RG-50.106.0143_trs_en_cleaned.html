<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="979">A: Okay, when I was younger I couldn't figure that out at all, but now, being older and seeing what has happened, my guess is that she was such a Nazi fanatic, she was a good friend of Hitler and deep inside she was convinced that Hitler did not know what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="980">She used to tell that to my father, to my mother, that Hitler doesn't know what's going on. </sentence><sentence id="981">Once he learns what's going on, he's going to stop that. </sentence><sentence id="982">And I believe because of that mentality, she was convinced if she would be caught helping us, that Hitler would free her and she would say everything to Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="983">A-And I think that's the only reason that I can think of why she helped us. </sentence><sentence id="984">And of course she mu-must also feel that she brought me onto this <span class="env feature">world</span>. </sentence><sentence id="985">And I think that's the only reason. </sentence><sentence id="986">And I think I'm the only Jewish person she ever assisted in a birth. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3972">A: In the political life, yes, I am very active in the political life. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3974">Q: Why is that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3976">A: Well, probably it goes back because about 30 years ago the former governor of the state of <span class="populated place">Washington</span>, Albert D. Rosellini and I became good friends, strictly through my C.P.A. And my C.P.A. is a Sephardic Jew, also speaks Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, he speaks about seven languages. </sentence><sentence id="3977">And the former governor is an American, but he is from Italian parents. </sentence><sentence id="3978">In fact, a book has been written on him. </sentence><sentence id="3979">And my C.P.A., Victor Barkey(ph) introduced me to Governor Rosellini, and they have been long, long friends, and they always speak Italian together. </sentence><sentence id="3980">And over the years Governor Rosellini and I have become very close friends. </sentence><sentence id="3981">And he is the man -- again probably because I am in the <span class="building">computer business</span> and I did mailings for candidates and so forth. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3988">Q: So it's not because you were aware of what can happen when a political system goes awry? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3990">A: No, definitely not, it is just that I helped in the political party and some of them -- right now yes, I'm very active to get Mark Sidran elected as mayor, because first of all, he is Jewish and he tries to eliminate demonstration that shouldn't be there. </sentence><sentence id="3991">Again, people like -- that put up that This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="3992">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="3993"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50. </sentence><sentence id="3994">106*0143 89 swastika, and he's definitely, of course, against that, and he is against, naturally, anti-Semitism. </sentence><sentence id="3995">And lately we have seen a little bit of that in <span class="populated place">Seattle</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4003">Q: What does that do to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4005">A: It bothers me. </sentence><sentence id="4006">And again, that's why I'm very much in support of Mark Sidran for mayor. </sentence><sentence id="4007">And hopefully he will have a police chief that can do the right thing. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4017">A: I'm sure it is, and again I say why does that happen? </sentence><sentence id="4018">Again, I was all for the <span class="country">U.S.</span> to help out with troops over there. </sentence><sentence id="4019">I didn't like the way it was taken out. </sentence><sentence id="4020">And again, i-it bothers me, is just like the <span class="country">U.S.</span> could have helped many million of Jews being saved. </sentence><sentence id="4021">And why they aren't helping out further bothers me. </sentence><sentence id="4022">I don't like what happened in <span class="country">Iraq</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4023">I think they -- it was good for us to be in there, but why not get rid of the main cancer in <span class="country">Iraq</span>, which is still over there. </sentence><sentence id="4024">And those things bother me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4033">Q: Do you think you are more sensitive to that than those of us who did not grow up in Europe? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4035">A: Tm sure I am, I'm sure I am. </sentence><sentence id="4036">I know a lot of people, including Jews in <span class="populated place">Seattle</span> that did not like us going into <span class="country">Rwanda</span> or <span class="country">Iraq</span> and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="4037">They say why should we get involved? </sentence><sentence id="4038">I said, the same reason we should have been involved to save Jews. </sentence><sentence id="4039">And some of them, like I say, even other Jewish people I know, were against that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
