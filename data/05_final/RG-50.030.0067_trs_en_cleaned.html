<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="117">Q: What happened, with the <span class="building">hotel</span>, or what did you begin to notice? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="119">A: In 1941, there was a <span class="building">club</span> in <span class="country">Holland</span>, and it was a <span class="building">men's club</span>. </sentence><sentence id="120">Very sophisticated, for lawyers; and, and the German right away took that <span class="building">building</span>. </sentence><sentence id="121">So one of the head of the police and the owner from that <span class="building">men's club</span> came to my mother and say, you know, "Why don't you go out of the <span class="building">hotel</span>, so the Germans don't take it. </sentence><sentence id="122">And we take your <span class="building">hotel</span> and that you will  save." </sentence><sentence id="123">And my mother was very upset, of course. </sentence><sentence id="124">They really-- my father died, what I told you -- they really built that <span class="building">hotel</span> by themselves, really built it. </sentence><sentence id="125">And to leave everything, just to go out what you have in your hand, was very hard. </sentence><sentence id="126">So I don't remember exactly what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="127">I know after many talking with the police and with this man, the owner, my mother had to go out of the <span class="building">hotel</span> and could just take with her--they talked her into it, perhaps it was the best-they could just go out of the <span class="building">hotel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="128">And there was another Jewish family in our <span class="populated place">home town</span> what, had a little <span class="building">house</span>, very poor little <span class="building">house</span> in a very poor <span class="region">area</span>, and, we moved in that little <span class="building">house</span> in. </sentence><sentence id="129">But I have to tell -- yeah -- it was already -- we moved into the <span class="building">hotel</span> in and in that little <span class="building">house</span> in, and, and it was horrible. </sentence><sentence id="130">There was no hot water and there was no <span class="interior space">bathroom</span> and it was a very poor <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span> and I really hated it, | remember; and it was a very difficult time because, you were not allowed to go out and you hear the German already walking through your <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="131">And also one day the German took all the people what went over to another religion, like there were was a Jewish boy by the name Wynberg and he went over to the Catholic religion, and they picked up all the people what went over to the, the Jews what went over to the Catholic religion. </sentence><sentence id="132">So they didn't know -- they picked my mother and my two brothers and me. </sentence><sentence id="133">My oldest brother was married. </sentence><sentence id="134">I, 1 come from a family from four children and I was the youngest. </sentence><sentence id="135">I had three older brothers. </sentence><sentence id="136">And they took us already to the <span class="dlf">German border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="137">But in <span class="country">Holland</span> was a <span class="building">Jewish Raad</span>", a Jewish group of people. </sentence><sentence id="138">What they say they help the Jews going to, <span class="country">Poland</span> and <span class="country">Germany</span>, but they went after it and they know that they made a mistake and we were already one or two days. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="159">Q: Okay, fine. </sentence><sentence id="160">Can you just go back and explain why were you taken? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="163">A: Because that was a mistake. </sentence><sentence id="164">It was a mistake that they took us because, they didn't know that the, the <span class="building">Wynberg</span>, that boy, that he was it. </sentence><sentence id="165">They thought that we were it. </sentence><sentence id="166">It was a mistake. </sentence><sentence id="167">And it -- because we had the same name. </sentence><sentence id="168">And so they sent us already -- and always we had a little <span class="spatial object">backpack</span> staying by the <span class="dlf">door</span> because everybody knows already that it would be perhaps something like that happened, that, that we would be called up, so we went to that -- <span class="populated place">Enschede</span> was the <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="169">We went to <span class="populated place">Enschede</span>. </sentence><sentence id="170">It was on the <span class="dlf">German border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="171">And when we were there the Dutch Jewish organization, the <span class="building">Jewish Raad</span> was there -- I don't know how it is in English. </sentence><sentence id="172">They, they went working very effective and they got us back to my, to <span class="populated place">Zwolle</span>, where I lived. </sentence><sentence id="173">And I remember when we came back. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="185">Q: And how did they get you back? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="187">A: I don't know, exactly. </sentence><sentence id="188">They talked with the Germans and they told them that they have the wrong people and that we were the wrong people and that they have to have this other boy what he went over to the Catholic religion and not we. </sentence><sentence id="189">We were Jews, and, and that's the reason, they got us back. </sentence><sentence id="190">They went after that they said they had the wrong people. </sentence><sentence id="191">But that was just a postponing of a time. </sentence><sentence id="192">And so we went -- I remember we came back and all the * Council (Dutch)  people were standing on the <span class="dlf">street</span> and, and everybody was cheering that we came back and, and everybody came to our <span class="building">house</span> and congratulated us. </sentence><sentence id="193">That's the reason it's so in my memory, that thing, that way. </sentence><sentence id="194">But, it didn't help much. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="204">Q: What happened when you did go back? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="206">A: Nothing happened. </sentence><sentence id="207">We just-- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="210">Q: What was your life like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="212">A: Our life was -- we were not allowed to do anything, so it was very, very upsetting. </sentence><sentence id="213">It was very strenuous and it was very nervous. </sentence><sentence id="214">And, and the men had to go already to, <span class="populated place">work camp</span> but I'm talking now where it's already the end of 1941, beginning 1942 or so. </sentence><sentence id="215">And, the men had to go to <span class="populated place">work camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="216">And I remember my brother was -- one of my brothers was hidden and he just got married not long before, and her father had to go a <span class="populated place">work camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="217">And they starting already talking; they say, "Oh, when somebody goes to a <span class="populated place">work camp</span>, then my father will be sent away. </sentence><sentence id="218">So you better come out of the <span class="region">hiding place</span>." </sentence><sentence id="219">So my brother came out of the hiding place and her father -- they would have sent away anyway -- my -- you know, the rumors go around. </sentence><sentence id="220">You didn't know what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="221">And so my brother came out. </sentence><sentence id="222">And the men went to <span class="populated place">working camps</span>, but they were allowed to go weekends <span class="building">home</span>; so nobody saw something difficult in it, not so serious in it. </sentence><sentence id="223">They thought, "Oh, they have to go there for helping, doing things," and they came weekends <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="224">So in between, also, there were things going on in, in my <span class="populated place">home town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="225">That a young group of men didn't have anything to do. </sentence><sentence id="226">They're all -- everybody what had a business was taken away already for the Germans and they put Volk-, traitors what went with the Germans-they put in these <span class="building">businesses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="227">So the men didn't have anything to do. </sentence><sentence id="228">And we were not allowed to go out of the <span class="building">house</span> after five o'clock at night; we have to stay in. </sentence><sentence id="229">So these men, eight young married men, came together and played card. </sentence><sentence id="230">And one of the traitors, a Dutch man, went to the German and say, "You know, that bunch of Jews sitting there and playing card." </sentence><sentence id="231">And they took these eight men and sent them to <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="232">So that was going on a lot. </sentence><sentence id="233">It was a, a lot of Dutch, not-Jewish people, what were traitors; and you had to be very, very careful, to not to talk and not to, say anything. </sentence><sentence id="234">I tried to, to, to do something, what, what I told you I went to <span class="populated place">Apeldoorn</span> and helped--and that's a little <span class="populated place">town</span> not far from my <span class="populated place">hometown</span>--and helped an older family, an older couple. </sentence><sentence id="235">But it was after a very short time also very dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="236">And there was not much what you could do. </sentence><sentence id="237">I remember one day I was walked in my <span class="dlf">street</span>, and in the <span class="dlf">street</span> where I was, was a big <span class="building">house</span> and there was a Catholic priest lived in there. </sentence><sentence id="238">And the Catholic priest came to me and he say -- he start talking to me, and he said, "How do you think that you can save your life?" </sentence><sentence id="239">And I say, "The only way that I, that the Jews can save their life, is when not-Jewish people take us in." </sentence><sentence id="240">And, the same evening he came to me and he say, "I have a <span class="building">house</span> for you. </sentence><sentence id="241">I have a place for you where you can go. </sentence><sentence id="242">And be ready tomorrow morning at five o'clock, six o'clock," I don't remember exactly what time, but very early in the morning, "with your <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span>, and a little bit what you can take with you on the <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span>, and I will bring you there." </sentence><sentence id="243">And that what I did. </sentence><sentence id="244">I remember I say goodbye to my mother and to my brothers, and I never saw them again. </sentence><sentence id="245">That was the last time, time that I ever saw my family. </sentence><sentence id="246">And, we  went to <span class="populated place">Utrecht</span>, and I went to, a family -- no, a woman, what she was a nurse. </sentence><sentence id="247">She came also from my <span class="populated place">hometown</span>. </sentence><sentence id="248">I went to her <span class="building">house</span> and, I stayed with her a few months. </sentence><sentence id="249">And that was very, a very nice place with this woman to live; what she was the whole day gone and I was the whole day alone. </sentence><sentence id="250">And, then she had another family what she want to take in, and I went to another family's <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="251">A very large <span class="building">house</span> with, a lot of <span class="interior space">room</span>, and I was there the maid. </sentence><sentence id="252">I had to clean the <span class="building">house</span>, and I had to, was not allowed to talk to anybody. </sentence><sentence id="253">I was not allowed to go open the <span class="dlf">door</span> ever. </sentence><sentence id="254">I was not allowed to go out of the <span class="building">house</span>; and there was no food in the <span class="building">house</span> and it was very hard already, food in <span class="country">Holland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="255"><span class="country">Holland</span> -- they suffered tremendous in the war. </sentence><sentence id="256">They didn't have, much to eat and they had, didn't have much, it was very difficult; and these people, they really didn't have anything in the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="257">I remember they cooked the bones ten times to make soup and they had the cat's plate already with it. </sentence><sentence id="258">It was very awful fam-- it was a very awful time for me to be there alone. </sentence><sentence id="259">And, I, I didn't I didn't get much to eat there. </sentence><sentence id="260">I remember I stole sometimes an apple, or I put in a sandwich under my <span class="spatial object">pillow</span> that at night when I came to my <span class="spatial object">bed</span> that I had something to eat-- because there was, really nothing to eat there. </sentence><sentence id="261">These people -- when I was there a few months, they had another Jewish family and they took in; an professor it was there--I met his wife, and they came <span class="interior space">upstairs</span> and they want to use me also as a maid. </sentence><sentence id="262">I didn't let it. </sentence><sentence id="263">They had, they wanted I cleaned the <span class="spatial object">oven</span> and things like that, and I didn't do that. </sentence><sentence id="264">Because I was so very lonely and so unhappy, one day they told me that not far from them is another Jewish family hidden; and, I want to go and visit them. </sentence><sentence id="265">And I was very happy that I could talk with somebody. </sentence><sentence id="266">So after three months being alone in, in that, locked up in that <span class="building">house</span> and not really having to talk with anybody. </sentence><sentence id="267">And they were very Christian. </sentence><sentence id="268">They really tried me to get over to their religion too, but, you know, it was very -- it was not very pleasant time. </sentence><sentence id="269">I went, to this family, and the moment that I came into this family's <span class="building">house</span>, the police came. </sentence><sentence id="270">And, I was very sure that I was safe because I had a passport and it was -- every Jew in <span class="country">Holland</span> had to have a passport with a "J" on it, and the <span class="interior space">underground</span> took my "J" out of the passport. </sentence><sentence id="271">Well, I didn't know that you hold it to the light that you can see the J, so I came there and I -- and when the police came. </sentence><sentence id="272">There were also police what were with the German. </sentence><sentence id="273">Dutch police that went over to <span class="building">NSB</span>", as they called them; and when police came I say I'm a nurse and have come to help these people. </sentence><sentence id="274">And so they took my passport and hold it to the light and they saw the "J" and that was it. </sentence><sentence id="275">So there wasn't -- there was a family hidden there, a lawyer. </sentence><sentence id="276">And what I didn't know, the people where I was hidden were traitors. </sentence><sentence id="277">That what I heard when I came back. </sentence><sentence id="278">Twenty-eight Jews are caught after that I, after that I was the first one what was hidden there; and nothing happened to the people what lived in the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="279">Always when the German found Jews in an <span class="building">house</span>, they took the whole family -- most of the time the whole family, but sometimes just the men. </sentence><sentence id="280">And there never was happen something to these people, but I didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="281">I heard it all after the war. </sentence><sentence id="282">These men went to <span class="building">jail</span>, but because I didn't know, after the war I, I testified for that they saved -- that what I know. </sentence><sentence id="283">3 National Socialistische Beweging (Dutch); National Socialist Movement. </sentence><sentence id="284"> Later on I heard what was happened to them. </sentence><sentence id="285">So anyway, the police tried to get to know from me where I was hidden, but I didn't want to tell because I thought I know there was another Jewish family there, and they have a chance then to, to get away. </sentence><sentence id="286">And so I didn't tell them;

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1345">A: I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="1346">I really don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="1347">But I was sick. </sentence><sentence id="1348">a week, six weeks. </sentence><sentence id="1349">Chaim always covered up for me, a lot of times. </sentence><sentence id="1350">And also my girls, the girls -- the--Ula, Ursula Stern--what I did from the beginning for them when they was sick, or we could help each other. </sentence><sentence id="1351">You have to have somebody what covers up for you in a <span class="populated place">camp</span>, if not you couldn't live. </sentence><sentence id="1352">You lived -- I slept together with Mimie Katz -- she came from <span class="country">Holland</span>, <span class="populated place">Haarlem</span> -- and <span class="populated place">Ula</span>, where I slept in the middle. </sentence><sentence id="1353">So when something, we, we could help each other, that's what we did, so, after the -- I don't -- I, lremember that the <span class="populated place">camp</span> got bigger and bigger. </sentence><sentence id="1354">More people from, <span class="populated place">Minsk</span>, from the <span class="populated place">Minsk</span> -- was a <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> in <span class="populated place">Minsk</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1355">And people from <span class="populated place">Minsk</span> came over, and we made big <span class="building">barracks</span>, the <span class="building">building</span> -- big <span class="building">barracks</span> in <span class="populated place">Sobibor</span> and we all were very scared because there came no <span class="spatial object">transports</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1356">They didn't come <span class="spatial object">transports</span>, and so we didn't know what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="1357">And then, when the <span class="spatial object">Minsk transport</span> came these guy from Ger-- from <span class="country">Russia</span>, Sash, Sasha, Sash -- he just died not long ago. </sentence><sentence id="1358">he came with a group of Russian Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1359">And I didn't talk with these, all these people, because, we Dutch people were, were like -- they think did the Dutch -- the Polish Jews hold together tremendous, and some of the young girls, had friends with the, with the Polish Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1360">So, Katty Gokkes, she was also a Dutch girl, and she had -- with one of the Kapos she was friendly. </sentence><sentence id="1361">She was very beautiful. </sentence><sentence id="1362">The German, the Polish Jews thought she was very beautiful. </sentence><sentence id="1363">And she had friendship with one of the Polish Jews and so that's the reason, she knows everything; and she could tell Ula. </sentence><sentence id="1364">But so, when you didn't have a Polish friend -- the, the <span class="spatial object">Polish stick</span> tremendous together. </sentence><sentence id="1365">They spoke Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="1366">We didn't speak Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="1367">In <span class="country">Holland</span>, they didn't spoke Yiddish; so we spoke German but not Yiddish, so, we were goyim, we were not Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1368">In the eyes from, from the, from the Polish Jews, we were not Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1369">We were Jews, of course. </sentence><sentence id="1370">We were at <span class="populated place">Sobibor</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1371">But we were not, we were -- they they didn't understand that we didn't speak Yiddish, and they stick tremendous together, so when the whole thing from the uprising, we didn't know anything about it. </sentence><sentence id="1372">The Dutch Jews didn't know anything about it. </sentence><sentence id="1373">Ula was lucky that she knows this other girl that was also a survivor. </sentence><sentence id="1374">It was lucky because of Katty Gokkes that she knows. </sentence><sentence id="1375">Katty knows about that, she had a relationship with one of the Kapos. </sentence><sentence id="1376">I don't remember his name. </sentence><sentence id="1377">So, when there was already something going on and then they built very big <span class="building">barracks</span>; so we went also, came in the big <span class="building">barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1378">And I remember -- I don't remember much about it. </sentence><sentence id="1379">I don't remember much about it that I came to the big <span class="building">barrack</span>; but I remember what it was a little bit better, what it was in that big <span class="building">barrack</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1380">There was a very big and much nicer, and I remember there was another girl -- Viool was her name-that she came to <span class="populated place">Sobiber</span> with her father and two sisters and they could sing very beautiful, and they were and they were always singing. </sentence><sentence id="1381">And so she got also typhus and she was very sick and she had also a, a boyfriend and he left her there. </sentence><sentence id="1382">He didn't take her -- he ran away by himself. </sentence><sentence id="1383">And there was another Dutch man -- not a -- from <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>, he's alive -- Kurt Thomas, and he was friendly with Katty Gokkes. </sentence><sentence id="1384">That was his girlfriend; and when they run away and they were  9 in the <span class="env feature">woods</span>, he say, "Where's Katty?," </sentence><sentence id="1385">he says. " </sentence><sentence id="1386">I have no idea where Katie is. </sentence><sentence id="1387">You should know. </sentence><sentence id="1388">You should have taken her with you like Chaim did." </sentence><sentence id="1389">So Katty Gokkes also died. </sentence><sentence id="1390">I, I, I'm -- almost everybody died. </sentence><sentence id="1391">But anyway, I didn't know anything what was going on from the uprising. </sentence><sentence id="1392">So one day -- it was, it was very dangerous also. </sentence><sentence id="1393">It was like a war. </sentence><sentence id="1394">Like in, in like there is a war, just a few people know about it; so nobody -- there was just a very small group know about the uprising in <span class="populated place">Sobibor</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1395">And one day Chaim tells me, "Try to get some clothes. </sentence><sentence id="1396">I tried to get some boots; and dress yourself up." </sentence><sentence id="1397">I was already a little bit better. </sentence><sentence id="1398">It was -- I, I was already much better, and so I-- there is a <span class="building">barrack</span> -- all the boots, all the clothes went to different <span class="building">barracks</span>, different <span class="building">tents</span>, big <span class="building">tents</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1399">The boots were together. </sentence><sentence id="1400">The clothes were together. </sentence><sentence id="1401">Oh, yeah -- one thi-- one day -- also, my mother knitted a lot and all my clothes was always knitted. </sentence><sentence id="1402">Especially when I go to <span class="country">Poland</span>, my mother put sure that in the <span class="spatial object">backpack</span> was all warm clothes. </sentence><sentence id="1403">And Ula, Ula Stern, was a big person and I was a big person. </sentence><sentence id="1404">One day she couldn't find any clothes, so she went to the <span class="building">barrack</span> and she -- coincident, she took one of the dresses what my mother knitted. </sentence><sentence id="1405">And she came to, came to the <span class="building">barrack</span>; and I remember that she had my dress on. </sentence><sentence id="1406">I was very upset of course, it was my mother's dr-- made that, so.... But, so it was all <span class="building">barracks</span> that were over, that were sent, that were sent to <span class="country">Poland</span>; where they make bundles out of it. </sentence><sentence id="1407">There were other people again what worked there. </sentence><sentence id="1408">Other people what worked and organized everything to separate. </sentence><sentence id="1409">And it went in the <span class="spatial object">trains</span> what went back; what when the Jews came, the <span class="spatial object">trains</span> went back with all clothes what went back to <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1410">And that went also, before the people went to the <span class="interior space">gas chamber</span>, the men had to go and cut their hair; and that also went back to <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1411">Everything, also the gold; and, we had to separate gold, and many times when we had to assort the clothes we found diamonds and gold in it, and I remember once I found a whole handful of diamonds and the German saw it and he took it. </sentence><sentence id="1412">The Germans when they went on vacation to <span class="country">Germany</span>, they took the <span class="spatial object">backpack</span> full with ger-- with gold and with silver and with, with everything what, what they could grab; what was, what the Germans really want for the army. </sentence><sentence id="1413">You know? </sentence><sentence id="1414">So, when you, when you found that you have to give it up. </sentence><sentence id="1415">I had to assort the clothes. </sentence><sentence id="1416">And I was not so clever, really, that I thought about that the German and they take the gold; but a lot of people took it and hide it. </sentence><sentence id="1417">I, I always cut out all the clothes what I had assorted. </sentence><sentence id="1418">I, I cut it in pieces, when I saw that's the only sabotage what I can do. </sentence><sentence id="1419">You know, to cut the clothes. </sentence><sentence id="1420">And Chaim, and when I found something what nobody could see, I give it to Chaim. </sentence><sentence id="1421">The fireman what had to burn all the pictures and all the documents what were burned in <span class="populated place">Sobibor</span> -- Chaim, that was Chaim's best friend. </sentence><sentence id="1422">Szmuel was his name. </sentence><sentence id="1423">And so Chaim many times put money under it, in the bottom and that went to him and he hide that in the <span class="env feature">ground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1424">That was hidden in the <span class="env feature">ground</span>, so I when we run away, Chaim makes sure that he got some of the money. </sentence><sentence id="1425">So, so we, we-- I didn't know anything, what was the uprising or anything what was, going-- absolutely had no idea. </sentence><sentence id="1426">So when Chaim told me try to get some warm clothes; then he told me, "Take some warm clothes," and he told me that what the plan is to do. </sentence><sentence id="1427">Then he told I was not allowed to tell it to anybody, absolutely-- and that's my always and guilt feeling. </sentence><sentence id="1428">I had a cousin there, and I didn't tell her; and the same day she say, "I will make some food," when she work in the where the <span class="spatial object">laundry</span>  0 for the Germans and she had a chance to cook something. </sentence><sentence id="1429">And I didn't tell her, and she didn't come out. </sentence><sentence id="1430">And I always feel guilty that I didn't do it. </sentence><sentence id="1431">So, I went to a <span class="building">barrack</span>, and there was one German that was sometimes good. </sentence><sentence id="1432">He didn't get also not much punishment, and he give me a pair of boots. </sentence><sentence id="1433">And I had a lot of clothes on, what was very dumb, because when the German would have seen me with so much clothes on, he would have asked, "Why do you have so much clothes on?" </sentence><sentence id="1434">So Chaim told me, "On four o'clock be by a big place." </sentence><sentence id="1435">That is-- and also the, the medicine, all the medicine the Dutch people brought a lot of medicine and that went also in one big place where, where they put the, the medicine, so the medicine was in that big place. </sentence><sentence id="1436">And there he say, "Come there at four o'clock." </sentence><sentence id="1437">So I make sure that I walked there at four o'clock. </sentence><sentence id="1438">Everybody was working. </sentence><sentence id="1439">Everything -- nobody knows anything. </sentence><sentence id="1440">Everything -- just a very small group of people what were involved in this in this uprising. </sentence><sentence id="1441">So everything went through normal. </sentence><sentence id="1442">I went walked -- I don't know how, how I came to that, was allowed to walk there. </sentence><sentence id="1443">Anyway, I walked there. </sentence><sentence id="1444">I remember also in <span class="populated place">camp</span>, once before the uprising, that I walked somewhere and I heard that the Germans spoke to the whole group of transport people; and I saw the rabbi and the cantor from my <span class="populated place">home town</span>, sitting there. </sentence><sentence id="1445">And I, you know, I just -- I was planned just to run to them or -- but I couldn't have done anything. </sentence><sentence id="1446">Also, many times I saw people from my <span class="populated place">home town</span> walking. </sentence><sentence id="1447">There was a little <span class="dlf">window</span>, and I saw people from my <span class="populated place">home town</span> passing this <span class="dlf">window</span>; and I was afraid that they would see me, you know, I made almost sure. </sentence><sentence id="1448">Whole families I saw walking to the <span class="interior space">gas chamber</span>, many, many times. </sentence><sentence id="1449">And, and I couldn't say anything when even -- was no way, nothing that I could do. </sentence><sentence id="1450">Nothing that I could do. </sentence><sentence id="1451">So I walked to <span class="populated place">Chaim</span>, and on four o'clock, and I come there. </sentence><sentence id="1452">I remember I walked in there, and one of the Kapos -- Wieszubski was his name, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1453">He killed already a few Germans, and he was very nervous. </sentence><sentence id="1454">And I say, "Take a pill for it, something for your nerves to calm down;" and he took it, and I remember and it was bitter and he spit it out. </sentence><sentence id="1455">Says he, "I don't need it." </sentence><sentence id="1456">So I met Chaim on the end, and there came -- there wasn't -- Chaim was not involved in the uprising, but somehow he say to me, "come there" and from there we will always go somehow in the <span class="region">area</span> for roll call. </sentence><sentence id="1457">So he want to be sure that we are together when there is a roll call. </sentence><sentence id="1458">And there was a boy standing there and he was involved, he was in the uprising involved, and he had to kill one German. </sentence><sentence id="1459">Together with the <span class="spatial object">Kapo</span>, with Wieszubski, and he say -- I was standing together with him and Chaim -- he say, "I'm afraid to go." </sentence><sentence id="1460">Said Chaim, "You have to go." </sentence><sentence id="1461">And said he, "I'm afraid." </sentence><sentence id="1462">Said Chaim -- "there's no way back." </sentence><sentence id="1463">What we know already there was one young boy what had a chance to go walk around in <span class="populated place">camp</span> and he knows already there were ten dead. </sentence><sentence id="1464">So there was -- we know already now, you know, there was -- we know it is our death. </sentence><sentence id="1465">When we, when we get caught now, that's the end. </sentence><sentence id="1466">So the, the electricity was already cut off and the <span class="spatial object">telephone</span> was already cut off; so there was already, you know, was already not a connection anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1467">So Chaim had no choice. </sentence><sentence id="1468">He run inside and took a knife, put it in his boots; and he walked to this, <span class="building">office</span> where Beckman", was his name, was and in between the Kapo was already there. </sentence><sentence id="1469">And he had no choice, Chaim. </sentence><sentence id="1470">And he -- I remember that he was gone. </sentence><sentence id="1471">I was inside to take "4 Scharfiihrer Kurt Beckman  1 the knife or something like that, and I didn't see him going away to the <span class="building">barrack</span>; and I went looking for him. </sentence><sentence id="1472">I said, "Where's Chaim? </sentence><sentence id="1473">Where's Chaim?" </sentence><sentence id="1474">Oh, I got so panicky, when I know already there was an uprising and there was something going on there, and I couldn't find Chaim. </sentence><sentence id="1475">And then one of the boys, he say that, "I say Chaim is in that <span class="building">barrack</span>." </sentence><sentence id="1476">And I went looking where Chaim was and I hear screaming, like somebody killed a pork. </sentence><sentence id="1477">Was screaming, this man -- the SS man was screaming, of course; and they were killing him with knives. </sentence><sentence id="1478">When it was -- we couldn't, we couldn't use guns or anything because nobody was allowed to hear, hear that we were -- that they were killing Germans because they were all over, the <span class="country">Ukraines</span> were standing there and the, and the Poles were all around. </sentence><sentence id="1479">So I went back to the spot;
