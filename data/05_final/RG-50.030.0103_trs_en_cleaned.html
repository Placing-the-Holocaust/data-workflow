id="28">A: So, the <span class="dlf">road</span> to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, in fact last year here in October, I went to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> and was given the so called golden doctorate diploma by the <span class="building">university</span>. </sentence><sentence id="29">I spoke to 600 law students to tell them a little bit what it was like to grow up in <span class="country">Germany</span> in the 20s and in the 30s. </sentence><sentence id="30">These kids didn't have a clue. </sentence><sentence id="31">It was all completely new to them. </sentence><sentence id="32">The names I mentioned of the people gave distinctive reputation to German and specifically <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> in the 20s. </sentence><sentence id="33">So, now I have my golden doctorate diplom </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="34">A: Now, I left <span class="country">Germany</span> after as I said after my doctorate exam and came straight to the <span class="country">States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="35">Due largely to the fact that I had met a marvelous man in one of our conferences in the <span class="building">offices</span> of the World Union for Progressive Judaism in <span class="populated place">London</span>, Montefiore and Lilly Montegue, and his name was Rabbi Lazerum, and he was the rabbi of the <span class="populated place">Baltimore</span> Hebrew congregation. </sentence><sentence id="36">He would urge me long before to come to the <span class="country">United States</span>, and finally sent me an affidavit which I needed to gain my <span class="dlf">entrance</span> into the <span class="country">States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="37">I went to <span class="populated place">Baltimore</span> and I had a fellowship at <span class="building">John Hopkins University</span> in Political Economics. </sentence><sentence id="38">Then later I went to <span class="populated place">New York</span> and had a position with the National Refugee Service, where I led a division for social and cultural adjustment, and at the same time studied social work at the <span class="building">New York School of Social Work</span>, and got my diplom </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="39">A: Then war broke out, and I decided I had to do something about it. </sentence><sentence id="40">I wasn't eligible immediately because I had three dependents and I was a little too old then. </sentence><sentence id="41">So, I decided to go to <span class="populated place">Washington</span> to look for a position with any of the <span class="building">war agencies</span>. </sentence><sentence id="42">I was rather lucky to find a position as analyst with which was called the <span class="building">Foreign Broadcast Intelligence Service</span>. </sentence><sentence id="43">It was part of the <span class="building">Fellow Communications Committee</span>. </sentence><sentence id="44">What we did was to monitor any rebroadcasts mostly and write analyses and send them on to the <span class="building">war department</span> or <span class="building">State Department</span> or the <span class="building">White House</span>, where there was need for this kind of information. </sentence><sentence id="45">In fact, it included a lot of hard intelligence which was hard to develop. </sentence><sentence id="46">My immediate tutor, mentor, and boss was Doctor Hanzpier, one of the noted sociologists who was also from <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, who died recently. </sentence><sentence id="47">From <span class="building">Foreign Broadcast Intelligence Service</span> I switched over the OSS, the <span class="building">Office of Strategic Services</span> and became a political analyst there. </sentence><sentence id="48">Then, when was nearing its end, and we began to focus on postwar targets, and the Nuremberg Trial was mentioned, I was given the job by OSS to draft the so called pretrial briefs against the Nazi party, the SS, the SA, the Hitler Youths, and I spent about a year trying to get this material together. </sentence><sentence id="49">It proved that we had an enormous amount of material, and yet some of the most important documents like the one document which stipulated the extermination of European Jews was not among them. </sentence><sentence id="50">We must have had it somewhere, but it was not made available at the time. </sentence><sentence id="51">But we had plenty of material when we went to <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="52">I was sent with a team, a research team, under the leadership of Franz Noriman, one of the other great political analysts who emigrated from <span class="country">Germany</span>, and eventually took over his position of chief of research in <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span> where we continued to collect and present evidence for use by the prosecution. </sentence><sentence id="53">We were part of the American prosecution in <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="54">It was a fascinating experience and I've talked about it often and have written about it, and it was in retrospect I feel a very important and very useful experience. </sentence><sentence id="55">This has been contested by many people who have attacked the Nuremberg Trials as having been trial of the victors who were vanquished and trials based on expo facto law. </sentence><sentence id="56">I didn't see any of these views. </sentence><sentence id="57">I think the Nuremberg Trial was a monumental effort, first of all to punish some of This is a verbatim

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="85">Q: Can you give us some specific cases that you worked on and some of the people that you worked with? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="87">A: Well, we tried for one thing, Bill Donovan, who was the head of the OSS and my boss, and I worked together in <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span> and we tried to break down the testimony of Herman Goering, who was the prima dona of the trial. </sentence><sentence id="88">It was enormously difficult. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="89">Goering was a man of extreme intelligence. </sentence><sentence id="90">We gave him ani. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="91">Q: test, all the defendants, and Goering and , a former minister of finance and potentially  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection rag the Stormer, Storm Trooper you might call it. </sentence><sentence id="92">This was his show. </sentence><sentence id="93">He felt that he was vindicated completely by that picture. </sentence><sentence id="94">He also was the one, he was sentenced to death who allegedly, I wasn't there, shortly before his execution said to the executioner now you have your poem after all. </sentence><sentence id="95">He knew his Jewish calendar obviously. </sentence><sentence id="96">Now, those are scenes from <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="97">I do remember many others that may be worth quoting, but the trial itself was conducted by a <span class="spatial object">bench</span> which was divided in four parts, two American judges, two Soviet judges, two French judges and two Russian judges. </sentence><sentence id="98">They were not in agreement all of the time. </sentence><sentence id="99">That was obvious, but still the proceedings were conducted with utter dignity and decorum and I'll never forget the opening statement of the presiding judge, Judge Lawrence from <span class="country">Great Britain</span> that this was a trial to be conducted without fear or favor. </sentence><sentence id="100">And it was. </sentence><sentence id="101">We had a galaxy of lawyers, SS prosecutors, as well as defendants and judges of course. </sentence><sentence id="102">The judgment was to many disappointing although some of them the guilty one including the military, top military were sentenced to death. </sentence><sentence id="103">I carried away from <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span> the conviction that I had attended an event that would go down in history as one of the probably most remarkable demonstrations of international justice, and I still feel that same way about it. </sentence><sentence id="104">Although I will admit that the major purposes of <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span> to protect peace and to ban genocide and anti-semitism have not yet been met and probably will not for some time to come. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="120">Q: Can we digress for a second and go back to your role as to exactly you did for preparation of this trial and who you interacted with? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="122">A: Well, I interrogated quite a few of the defendants and also as I mentioned before wrote these pretrial briefs in which I packed all the evidence we had at the time on the felonies of the party leaders, the so called leadership core, the SS, the SA also many of these things came to light after the trial including the one document as I mentioned. </sentence><sentence id="123">I was chief of research. </sentence><sentence id="124">That was my title in <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="125">I had a staff of a dozen people, most of them members of the <span class="building">Office of Strategic Services</span>, including such upstanding lawyers as John Herz, who was part of it, and was a professor in <span class="populated place">New York</span>, later. </sentence><sentence id="126">And we just collected the evidence and some of the evidence that came to us in the most peculiar ways I remember that one day a reporter from the <span class="populated place">New York</span> times, came in my <span class="building">office</span> and said I understand you're responsible here for collection of evidence. </sentence><sentence id="127">I was in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="128">I went to the <span class="building">Chancellory</span>, Hitler's <span class="building">Chancellory</span> which was a heap of rubble of course in those days. </sentence><sentence id="129">I looked around and there were a lot of papers and I picked some up. </sentence><sentence id="130">I don't read German. </sentence><sentence id="131">I have no idea what I picked up. </sentence><sentence id="132">I'd like you to take a look at it, and he handed me a piece of paper that was slightly torn and singed of course, but low and behold there was the order from the SA party judge for the so called crystal night to the S </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="133">A: You know it was long denied that that was any organized effort. </sentence><sentence id="134">It was always as the used to call it, the boiling soul of the people who did it, but far from it. </sentence><sentence id="135"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="136">A: Well, one I remember quite distinctly was who was the head of the <span class="dlf">labor farm</span> and he was a sad sap by the time they got to him, he was obviously ill. </sentence><sentence id="137">His eyes were tearing, his nose was flooding liberally, and I presented him with the chart of the party and said now you were the leader of the organization, tell me whether this is correct the way we put it together, and Lyle looked at it and he said well yes it is correct. </sentence><sentence id="138">It is correct, but that doesn't in any way reflect the reality. </sentence><sentence id="139">This was a dynamic organization and you cannot put it into <span class="spatial object">boxes</span> straight <span class="dlf">lines</span> and <span class="dlf">vertical lines</span> and what not. </sentence><sentence id="140">He then began to take my <span class="spatial object">fountain pen</span> to draw weird circles within circles and said this is the dynamism, unless you catch it you can't catch us. </sentence><sentence id="141">Two days later he was dead. </sentence><sentence id="142">He obviously had committed suicide. </sentence><sentence id="143">That was one example. </sentence><sentence id="144">Then there was a real red neck I got this SS leader from the <span class="region">eastern front</span>, a fellow by the name of , and I confronted him with some of the atrocities that were committed by the SS in <span class="region">southern Russia</span> and he looked at it and looked at it and said I don't understand how can you people know these things, you must have a terrific staff. </sentence><sentence id="145">I don't know whether he tried to find out in order to get a favorable consideration or not, but he was one of the worst <span class="building">butchers</span>. </sentence><sentence id="146">And then the other one, I will remember and never forget was a fellow by the name of . </sentence><sentence id="147">He was -- he referred to himself as the butcher of <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="148">He was an SS man, and he said I want to be confronted with some of the generals. </sentence><sentence id="149">We got him together with General , the tank general and a general by the name of </sentence></p><p><sentence id="150"> . </sentence><sentence id="151">He said to us, I know what we did in <span class="country">Russia</span>, but he said, but I'll be </sentence></p><p><sentence id="152"> darned if I take the blame all by myself. </sentence><sentence id="153">We generals here we are just as guilty. </sentence><sentence id="154">They participated, they had the regular army and they worked with us in some of the ammunition of the minorities in <span class="region">southern Russi</span> </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="155">A: absolutely denied it. </sentence><sentence id="156">I have never known, but I don't believe it. </sentence><sentence id="157">went to the collapse, and I have it black and white. </sentence><sentence id="158">It's in the <span

the Marshall plan, but we had to do something also for the education of the new generation. </sentence><sentence id="160">And out of this came the so-called re-education program, which was at the time was a multi million dollar program. </sentence><sentence id="161">Today you would have to put the equivalent of billions for the kind of help that we had at our disposal. </sentence><sentence id="162">I was appointed in the <span class="building">State Department</span>, Director of this program. </sentence><sentence id="163">We decided that one of the most important things to do was to get some of the young Germans, students, teachers, <span class="building">high school</span> students even to come over to the <span class="country">States</span> and have them stay here for a while to get to know what democracy looked like seeing not only from the federal but from the <span class="region">local level</span>, and we recreated a so-called leadership program where practically all the leading members in politics, in the law, in the professions were invited to come to the <span class="country">States</span>, including future presidents and chancellors of <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="164">And in order to give them a chance to observe what they found here and if possible to apply it on their return to <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="165">This was a program, I remember sitting here one night, at <span class="dlf">Pennsylvania Avenue</span>, in <span class="building">offices</span> and decided what this program should be like. </sentence><sentence id="166">The total exchange program of the <span class="country">United States</span> in those days was a few hundred and we are mostly Chinese students for some reason, I don't remember what it was. </sentence><sentence id="167">I said now we have to do much more here. </sentence><sentence id="168">I turned to the staff and I said we've never done it before, what would you think of a figure of 2,000. </sentence><sentence id="169">And of all people, my budget man spoke up and said 2,000, why not 3,000? </sentence><sentence id="170">Why not 3,500? </sentence><sentence id="171">I said do you think we can do it? </sentence><sentence id="172">He said I have no ide </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="173">A: We should try, and we did. </sentence><sentence id="174">We did within a short span of years about 13,000 people involved in this exchange program. </sentence><sentence id="175">Most of them came from <span class="country">Germany</span> to the <span class="country">States</span> and experts and teachers and political advisors went to <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="176">Then later we extended it to other <span class="country">European countries</span>. </sentence><sentence id="177">We paid for it, and it's still going, although most of it today is on a private basis. </sentence><sentence id="178">But this exchange program really must be given for quite a bit of credit for what really happened in terms of political reform in <span class="country">Germany</span> on the federal, state and <span class="region">local level</span>. </sentence><sentence id="179">That is the sort of thing we failed to do in the 20s. </sentence><sentence id="180">And I felt very strongly, well I wasn't the only one, this mistake had to be corrected after <span class="region">World War IL</span>. </sentence><sentence id="181">It must not be permitted again. </sentence><sentence id="182">And we found people like -- well not General Clay. </sentence><sentence id="183">General Clay in the beginning had doubts. </sentence><sentence id="184">General Clay felt that he had so much money available and that had to be spent for economic purposes. </sentence><sentence id="185">He kept saying you cannot teach democracy on an empty stomach. </sentence><sentence id="186">We had to agree with him, but no need to do one thing without the other. </sentence><sentence id="187">Well, he had concerns that German students coming to the <span class="country">United States</span> would be exposed to a lot of unpleasant personal experiences. </sentence><sentence id="188">It turned out to be totally wrong. </sentence><sentence id="189">We hardly ever had a single unpleasant experience among all these thousands of people who came over here, and we have proved to show it. </sentence><sentence id="190">These returning exchanges were responsible for a number of very important reforms in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="191">For instance, a group of parliamentary deputies, German , came to <span class="populated place">Washington</span> and they said  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection between the German chancellorship and the <span class="building">German parliament</span>. </sentence><sentence id="192">That was one thing. </sentence><sentence id="193">Another thing is they were preparing a new law for the military and we invited the whole committee which was preparing this law to come to the <span class="country">States</span> to make it show two things. </sentence><sentence id="194">First of all, the problem of civilian control over the military and how we protected the rights of the individual soldier against any intervention from the top. </sentence><sentence id="195">They came. </sentence><sentence id="196">We took them all over the <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="197">We opened the resources for him. </sentence><sentence id="198">We went back and made a very good law which is still in existence so those were some of the things that we tried to do with our so called re-education program. </sentence><sentence id="199">Incidentally let me say I never liked much the term re-education. </sentence><sentence id="200">It was really more to soften the American taxpayer than to appease the Germans and we later renamed it re-orientation which was not only appreciated but highly praised program and the <span class="building">German Parliament</span> passed a resolution thanking us for what we did there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="230">Q: Can I ask you your comparison between the trial that you participated in and the subsequent trials? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="232">A: Well, the subsequent trials really fell apart. </sentence><sentence id="233">If you want to see the documents as I read Telford Taylor's book and I was invited to go back as deputy to <span class="populated place">Telford Taylor</span> for the second trial and I didn't do so. </sentence><sentence id="234">I was so advised in fact by my old boss Bill Donovan of </sentence></p><p><sentence id="235"> , and it turned out that some of the trials were good and some of it is  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="236">A: Not in preparation, but while I was in <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span>, I took time off to go to <span class="populated place">Dachau concentration camp</span>, which was only a few miles down from <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="237">I went there. </sentence><sentence id="238">We had a guided tour by I think one of the former inmates. </sentence><sentence id="239">We went through the famous <span class="dlf">gate</span>, "Labor Makes You Free" or something like it. </sentence><sentence id="240">We went there. </sentence><sentence id="241">They showed us some of the <span class="spatial object">ovens</span>. </sentence><sentence id="242">In one of them I still detected some bones. </sentence><sentence id="243">They showed us the <span class="interior space">courtyard</span> where the prisoners were torn apart by dogs and they showed us the <span class="building">barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="244">That was after all a few months after the so-called liberation. </sentence><sentence id="245">That was an experience that no one can forget. </sentence><sentence id="246">I know that Eisenhower went there too at the time, well a few months earlier. </sentence><sentence id="247">Yes, I saw that, but I never saw the <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span> in the <span class="region">east</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
