<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="27">Q: Would you tell me about your family and growing up in_6d_? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="29">A: Well, uh...basically my life was, as a child, was sheltered and beautiful and I remember only wonderful things about my childhood. </sentence><sentence id="30">I had very caring and wonderful parents. </sentence><sentence id="31">My father...uh...was a very educated man, and uh...he had a <span class="building">factory</span> of...uh...uniforms...uh...sort of like...sol...for soldiers or like...uh...boy scout uniforms also and like preparatory ..uh...school uniforms...uh...and...uh...we were slightly upper middle class family, basically fairly well-to- do. </sentence><sentence id="32">I had a younger brother and...uh...we had a very good life. </sentence><sentence id="33">We used to go..., my brother went to...uh... <span class="building">Jewish private school</span> where they learned Hebrew and...uh...so on. </sentence><sentence id="34">We went to a <span class="building">private kindergarten</span>. </sentence><sentence id="35">I went to...uh...uh...regular ...uh... <span class="building">public school</span> which was...uh...only Jewish because this is the way the system was in <span class="country">Poland</span> that...uh...the Jews had their own, ...then their own <span class="building">schools</span> and the Polish people had their own <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="36">And the reason for that, evidently, was that the Polish people were not going to <span class="building">school</span> on Sundays and we did not go on Saturdays. </sentence><sentence id="37">So it was like, ...uh ...basically...uh...helping us not to be sacrilegious and so on, so it was good and we felt good about it. </sentence><sentence id="38">Of course, as far as antisemitism is concerned in <span class="country">Poland</span>, I as a child could...uh...notice things quite a lot. </sentence><sentence id="39">I occasionally would notice or hear that...uh... someone...uh... Jewish was beaten up or that...uh...you know, something...uh...little schul which was, you know, a small little <span class="building">synagogue</span>...uh...that was...uh...vandalized or burned or so. </sentence><sentence id="40">Those were little things and...uh...and my parents tried to ...uh...shelter me from it and for me not to, you know, grow up with a complex of these things but I knew of it. </sentence><sentence id="41">L..uh...when I was growing up,...uh...children, Polish children my age...uh...some let me know and would say something bad, "You Damn Jew" or something like that, to me. </sentence><sentence id="42">But...uh...the majority did not because  USHMM Archives RG-50.030*250 2 maybe children did not to such extent understand antisemitism or practice it as the older did, olders did. </sentence><sentence id="43">So, that was it and...uh...I don't know what else I can tell you. </sentence><sentence id="44">Life, in my opinion, was beautiful and...to me. </sentence><sentence id="45">Of course, I know that there were...uh...people of lower financial class that maybe did not have it so good in...in <span class="country">Poland</span>, but they were also people upgraded...uh...as far as financial situation and so on is concerned and they most probably had even a better life...uh...but... uh...I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="46">I know it existed, but I don't really... have not experienced it. </sentence><sentence id="47">We used to go every summer...we used to have a <span class="building">summer home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="48">Uh...We used to spend our summers there. </sentence><sentence id="49">And a funny thing happened. </sentence><sentence id="50">I visited <span class="country">Poland</span> two years ago, and I visited all those places. </sentence><sentence id="51">It was a very emotional journey for me. </sentence><sentence id="52">Of course, I still feel like it isn't enough. </sentence><sentence id="53">I would like to go back and see more of it, because I spent a short time in these places and so on. </sentence><sentence id="54">So maybe I will do it some day again. </sentence><sentence id="55">And then I...uh...the first year, I started going to <span class="building">high school</span> which was a private and only for Jewish girls. </sentence><sentence id="56">It was a <span class="building">girls" high school</span> and, like I said, private, but unfortunately it did not last too long because the Germans entered...uh...my <span class="populated place">city</span> in September 1939. </sentence><sentence id="57">Of course, we still went to <span class="building">school</span> for a couple of months and...uh...but as...uh... time went on, the Germans started occupying...occupying...uh...pri...<span class="building">buildings</span> that...like <span class="building">school buildings</span>, <span class="building">offices</span>, <span class="building">government offices</span>, and so on, and they settled themselves in our <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="58">They only used the third and...uh...second <span class="interior space">floor</span>, and we had the first <span class="interior space">floor</span> for us. </sentence><sentence id="59">But it became dangerous because we had to use the same <span class="interior space">bathrooms</span> and on some occasions...uh...we have heard that...uh...some girls were abused by the soldiers so for that reason alone, the <span class="building">school</span> was closed. </sentence><sentence id="60">It would have most probably lasted for another month or so, but it was too dangerous and it wasn't worth it. </sentence><sentence id="61">And...uh...so I stopped going to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="62">Uh... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="99">Q: What was life in _6d_ like right after the German occupation? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="101">A: Well, right after... Now first of all I would like to describe the entering of the Germans and slightly prior to it. </sentence><sentence id="102">I have heard that the war started with <span class="country">Germany</span> and, of course, all the soldiers were going toward the <span class="dlf">German borders</span> to defend <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="103">But it seemed like...its...they just simply turned back, and they were running. </sentence><sentence id="104">Uh...a day or two prior to the entrance of the Germans to _6d_, the Polish Army, without actually having, you know, without fighting, ran back and they were passing through our <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="105">And they were passing through our <span class="dlf">street</span> and they were heading somehow toward <span class="country">Russia</span>, running away. </sentence><sentence id="106">I will never forget that day because what...what we did, ..-uh...we were preparing sandwiches and food and we were giving it to the soldiers as they were going toward <span class="country">Russia</span> [the Polish army was retreating eastward in an attempt to avoid encirclement by the Germans]. </sentence><sentence id="107">The population of the <span class="populated place">city</span> remained. </sentence><sentence id="108">There were some that...uh...foresaw what was coming for some reason...uh...that also ran to <span class="country">Russia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="109">Many of those survived and they escaped <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> and <span class="populated place">camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="110">But for a family with children, it was difficult to run away. </sentence><sentence id="111">So basically who ran away is young women and young men that were unattached and many majority of them survived if they could survive the winters in <span class="country">Russia</span> and later on. </sentence><sentence id="112">Of course, the Germans practically were near...uh... <span class="populated place">Moscow</span> [only briefly in early December 1941] and...uh..of course, the Jews were running away and Jews at that time, somewhat were persecuted by...by the Russians also. </sentence><sentence id="113">So, but it still was evidently much easier to survive than to go on to <span class="populated place">camps</span> and <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span> where a majority of... uh... people perished in gas  USHMM Archives RG-50.030*250 3 <span class="interior space">chambers</span> and so on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="127">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="128">The Germans have entered _6d_. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="131">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="133">Q: Uh...What happened to you and your family? </sentence><sentence id="134">What did you do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="137">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="138">We stayed there until about the end of...the beginning of December, actually. </sentence><sentence id="139">And at that point my father thought that it was too dangerous to stay in _6d_, that there were talks about making a <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> in one part of the <span class="populated place">city</span> where the poorer people...where the poorer Jewish population lived, and they were going to push everybody in there...uh...and since my Mother's <span class="populated place">home town</span> was a small <span class="populated place">town</span> called <span class="populated place">Wierzbnik-Starachowice</span>, and my Mother still had relatives living over there, we...we thought that it would be easier for us to get there and, you know, we were hoping that the Germans would not be able to follow us. </sentence><sentence id="140">I mean it was just a dream that, but it...uh...they followed us, but a lot later and in the meantime, we were still able to exist as normal people without being thrown into a <span class="populated place">camp</span> and so on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="145">Q: How did you exist? </sentence><sentence id="146">How did you live in this <span class="populated place">town</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="149">A: During that time? </sentence><sentence id="150">Well, we...we did not take much with us. </sentence><sentence id="151">Whatever we could pack on a <span class="spatial object">wagon</span>! </sentence><sentence id="152">And, of course, the...the journey on the <span class="spatial object">wagon</span> from...uh..._ <span class="dlf">6d_</span> to <span class="populated place">Wierzbnik</span> was very unusual too because we were...we had to hide and we had to...uh...sort of...uh... pretend that we were not Jewish and the way we were doing it is, my father used to live during World War I in <span class="country">Germany</span> for some reason I don't understand why. </sentence><sentence id="153">He was born in <span class="country">Poland</span>, but he lived for some time in <span class="country">Germany</span>, near <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="154">He spoke a perfect German. </sentence><sentence id="155">As a matter of fact, a German with a dialect, which is very unusual because if a foreigner speaks...uh...German he will not speak with a dialect, because it is very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="156">So he spoke with a dialect and I learned German in <span class="building">school</span>, and I also was able to speak with Father some German. </sentence><sentence id="157">So we were able to sort of make believe that we are either of German descent or mixed Germans which they sort of, kind of, you know, were lenient with them. </sentence><sentence id="158">And we arrived to one <span class="populated place">city</span> where a German family .... Well, actually not all, also mixed-Germaan ...Germans hid us for a day or two until we were able to continue by <span class="spatial object">wagon</span> to...uh...<span class="populated place">Wierzbnik</span>. </sentence><sentence id="159">And since it was winter time it was a very difficult journey because the <span class="dlf">roads</span> were not cleared of snow, and the <span class="spatial object">wagon</span> was slipping and sliding, and the horse were...was...uh... tripping and it was a very bumpy, bumpy and bad trip, very cold and so on. </sentence><sentence id="160">But finally we arrived to <span class="populated place">Wierzbnik</span>, and...uh...after a little while.... We lived for sometimes with relatives,...uh.. but later on, we were able to rent an <span class="interior space">apartment</span> for ourself and we lived, so.... We had a sewing machine on the <span class="spatial object">wagon</span> and my father was a designer. </sentence><sentence id="161">I don't know if I mentioned that to you, but he was designing military clothes for the army before the war. </sentence><sentence id="162">He was also designing sportswear. </sentence><sentence id="163">Also...uh...boy scouts uniform and... and...for <span class="building">preparatory school</span> uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="164">So...uh...since he had the knowledge of...of making patterns and...and able to understand how to do things and so on, and I somehow always liked to sew, so we were doing some sewing. </sentence><sentence id="165">Father used to make the patterns and doing things like that; and I, under  USHMM Archives RG-50.030*250 4 his instruction, would sew the garments and we were able to make some money to sustain ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="166">Because all we needed at that time was just to buy potatoes and...and bread. </sentence><sentence id="167">That was our daily...uh...food, whatever we could make with it, because meat was very scarce and if there was any meat, the Polish people would get it. </sentence><sentence id="168">Somebody that had influence. </sentence><sentence id="169">In order words, people that grew up in the <span class="populated place">city</span> and so on, knew the natives, the Polish people, and in the <span class="populated place">city</span>, they were able to sort of obtain other staples of food...of food and so on. </sentence><sentence id="170">But since we were strangers, things were a little bit more difficult for us. </sentence><sentence id="171">Uh...later on, L..uh... decided that I will open up a little <span class="building">kindergarten</span>, and take care of small children for still working parents because it was not a <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> yet in this <span class="populated place">city</span> and we were just restricted as far as the time is concerned. </sentence><sentence id="172">In other words, we were not able to get out of our <span class="building">houses</span> before a certain time, which I imagine was 7 o'clock in the morning, and we had to be in our <span class="building">homes</span> at 5 o'clock. </sentence><sentence id="173">But, of course, people still continued working and so on. </sentence><sentence id="174">There were a lot of tailors, shoemakers and...uh... merchants in the <span class="populated place">city</span> and whatever else, just like it was before the war. </sentence><sentence id="175">So they continued to serve the <span class="populated place">community</span> and so on. </sentence><sentence id="176">And I...uh...the <span class="building">kindergarten</span> that I opened...it was in my own <span class="building">home</span>, which was consisting of one large <span class="interior space">room</span> and a kitchen.(cough) Excuse me. </sentence><sentence id="177">But usually, we would clear the <span class="interior space">room</span> and push the <span class="spatial object">furniture</span> back, and then accept the children at 9 o'clock and I would take care of them til 1 o'clock; and that helped the family survive because...uh... the kind of parents of the children would occasionally bring some articles of clothing, or extra food that they were able to get, you know, like meat and things like that, and they were paying me a certain amount of money. </sentence><sentence id="178">And I was doing it with another friend of mine who was the same age. </sentence><sentence id="179">We were about 16 at that time. </sentence><sentence id="180">Unfortunately, this young lady was killed by the Germans later on. </sentence><sentence id="181">So, this is how we tried to sustain ourselves during the time until..-until the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was formed and until they took us into a <span class="populated place">work camp</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="217">Q: How was the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> formed? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="219">A: Well, the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was still...uh...not terrible, by comparison to..to a <span class="populated place">work camp</span> or a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="220">In other words, we were still sort of free, but we have to abide by the tules of the Germans and..., but we were moving around freely in the <span class="region">area</span> of our confinement; and we were still together, which was the most important thing, my parents and my brother and I. And we...our lives were still sort of normal because we were able to get together with friends, with relatives, and amazing thing that all through our confinements in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> or in a <span class="populated place">work camp</span> or even in <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> is the fact that... uh...we were..., the Jewish population always had a sense of...of wanting to learn...of wanting...of...you know, wanting to have knowledge, so we did not stop. </sentence><sentence id="221">So, in...in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, we were...like for example, I continued...I was teaching young children in <span class="building">kindergarten</span>. </sentence><sentence id="222">Someone else, who had a little higher education than I, was teaching me. </sentence><sentence id="223">Of course, we all had to pay. </sentence><sentence id="224">And I remember I...] was taking algebra and continued with my German, although I spoke German well, but I...I needed to improve it, in...in writing and so on. </sentence><sentence id="225">And we were...I even took Latin. </sentence><sentence id="226">I took French, and we were able to...to get together and sing Hebrew songs. </sentence><sentence id="227">So it was important because we were still together. </sentence><sentence id="228">We were not torn apart, and therefore...uh...life seemed to be normal. </sentence><sentence id="229">It was very...uh...very special, too, because we...we valued each other much more than...than... It made us think, altho... although I cannot say that we valued each  USHMM Archives RG-50.030*250 5 other more. </sentence><sentence id="230">We just understood it better because family ties were very close among Jewish family...families in <span class="country">Europe</span> and...uh...ties with friends and relatives were also extremely important. </sentence><sentence id="231">And that was what was sustaining us and making our life bearable, that we did not have the comfort, we did not have...uh...the opportunities; we did not have a million things that we had before, but it did not seem to matter. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="245">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="246">Under what circumstances and when were you taken from the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> into a <span class="populated place">work camp</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="249">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="250">Uh...I will never forget that morning. </sentence><sentence id="251">Usually they...there were no announcements...announcements from the Germans of their plans. </sentence><sentence id="252">They usually did everything totally unexpected. </sentence><sentence id="253">If anything ever leaked out, it was either a gossip or...or it might have been some truth, or the times did not correspond. </sentence><sentence id="254">So...uh...but we knew of...we heard of other people being...uh...transferred to different <span class="populated place">cities</span>; and there were many people that were transferred from small little <span class="populated place">towns</span> near <span class="populated place">Wierzbnik-Starachowice</span> into our <span class="populated place">town</span>, and they were all...uh...you know, put into the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="255">And things were getting tighter and tighter, because we had to share our little <span class="interior space">room</span> and <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> with another family and another family. </sentence><sentence id="256">And we realized that it will not last...last like that forever, that things were getting worse. </sentence><sentence id="257">And, of course, the food situation was getting worse because of the incoming of so many people from other <span class="populated place">cities</span>. </sentence><sentence id="258">So...uh...we prepared ourselves, like for example, we made knapsacks for...for each one separately, and had them packed with the essential clothes; and my father, whatever little money we had, distributed the money among all four, amongst all four of us. </sentence><sentence id="259">That way that if we were separated that we should have the money to be able to help ourself. ( </sentence><sentence id="260">Cough) Excuse me. ( </sentence><sentence id="261">Cough) Anyhow, so basically we were prepared. </sentence><sentence id="262">We were not able to take any extras because we knew we couldn't carry it. </sentence><sentence id="263">Uh...so we left our household goods, our silverware, even a photo album which was so...so dear to us we had to leave. </sentence><sentence id="264">But I managed to stash away some pictures in a <span class="spatial object">bag</span> and kept it hidden... uh... and sure enough...uh...what happened is a few days later at 4 o'clock in the morning, the Germans at the same time knocked in all the <span class="dlf">doors</span>. </sentence><sentence id="265">The reason for that is that they did not want us to have the opportunity that one should find out, hear from the other and have a chance maybe to...of escaping. </sentence><sentence id="266">So, at the same time, they had hundreds and hundreds of Germans with dogs knocking on people's <span class="dlf">doors</span> and screaming, "Out! </sentence><sentence id="267">Out! </sentence><sentence id="268">Raus! </sentence><sentence id="269">Raus!" </sentence><sentence id="270">So many people, if they were not prepared as we were at that time, ...uh...ran out with basically nothing. </sentence><sentence id="271">And then they ran us all together and gathered us on a <span class="building">marketplace</span>. </sentence><sentence id="272">Each small <span class="populated place">city</span> had a <span class="building">marketplace</span> that was, you know, usually the <span class="populated place">cities</span> in <span class="country">Europe</span> had this point that was called the <span class="building">marketplace</span>. </sentence><sentence id="273">So we were all rounded up there and at some point, they had Germans doing a selection: right, left, right, left. </sentence><sentence id="274">So what was happening (cough), they were selecting younger and stronger people to remain in the <span class="populated place">city</span> and they were distributing them to those three <span class="populated place">camps</span> that were located in the <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="275">One <span class="populated place">camp</span> was a <span class="populated place">woodwork camp</span> where they were cutting wood; and before the war, I imagine they were making <span class="spatial object">furniture</span>. </sentence><sentence id="276">But during the war, the Germans confiscated it and they transferred it for their war purposes. </sentence><sentence id="277">So this particular <span class="populated place">camp</span> was manufacturing <span class="spatial object">boxes</span> for ammunition. </sentence><sentence id="278">They were manufacturing...uh...um...<span class="spatial object">stretchers</span> for the soldiers, and...uh... other things that were helping them for their war ..uh...purposes. </sentence><sentence id="279">Then there was a <span class="populated place">camp</span>...uh...nearby in the <span class="populated place">city</span>, nearby <span class="populated place">city</span> called  USHMM Archives RG-50.030*250 6 <span class="populated place">Starachowice</span> where they had a <span class="building">steel factory</span>; and...uh...all the Jews were ordered to work in the <span class="building">steel factory</span>, also manufacturing things for the war. </sentence><sentence id="280">And the <span class="populated place">camp</span> was nearby the <span class="building">factory</span>, and they were over there. </sentence><sentence id="281">And there was also one other <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="282">I don't know what specific purpose this particular <span class="populated place">camp</span> had. </sentence><sentence id="283">And they started selecting. </sentence><sentence id="284">My father and my mother, my brother and I were standing naturally together. </sentence><sentence id="285">When they came to us...when one of the Germans came to us with a dog and with a big...uh...switch that they used, you know, for beating horses when they were driving <span class="spatial object">carriages</span> and he wanted to separate us, my brother and I they left in the <span class="dlf">line</span>, and my father and my mother they pushed in the other <span class="dlf">line</span>. </sentence><sentence id="286">That means they were going to go to a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>, you know, instead of going to the <span class="populated place">work camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="287">Uh... someone who was...they had Polish, they had Jewish policemen ..uh...in our <span class="populated place">camp</span>..., in our <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> actually, to keep order amongst us, and they were evidently...uh... helping the Germans keep order during this ordeal of selecting the people. </sentence><sentence id="288">So, ...uh...one of the policemen...was a very good friend of my father's from <span class="building">school</span>, and he realized what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="289">And he came running and took my father and my mother out, and put us together. </sentence><sentence id="290">My mother at that time must have been maybe 36, 35--something like that. </sentence><sentence id="291">My father was a couple of years older;

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1120">A: When we arrived, they took us off the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1121">They separated us again. </sentence><sentence id="1122">Women separately. </sentence><sentence id="1123">Men separately. </sentence><sentence id="1124">And they told us to go into a <span class="building">building</span> where they say...said it was going to be a <span class="interior space">shower</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1125">We were allowed to take soap with us...uh..maybe a comb and a tooth brush and maybe those are the things. </sentence><sentence id="1126">I cannot recall. </sentence><sentence id="1127">I cannot be sure of that. </sentence><sentence id="1128">And...so we took...and we were allowed to take our shoes, I think. </sentence><sentence id="1129">Uh...And... uh...many people, since we were allowed to take soap and many people already had their soap, they pushed gold pieces, American gold pieces, into this soap and...uh...they saved them. </sentence><sentence id="1130">Uh...One lady whom I know and I meet quite often. </sentence><sentence id="1131">She lives in <span class="populated place">Toronto</span>, <span class="country">Canada</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1132">I just saw her recently. </sentence><sentence id="1133">She can never forget the fact that I have saved two...uh...gold pieces in...in the soap. </sentence><sentence id="1134">I risked my life but I...had no understanding of it. </sentence><sentence id="1135">I did it for her because she asked me. </sentence><sentence id="1136">And I used the soap for washing and as I washed naturally the place where you stuck the thing kind of got glued back and then when we got to the <span class="building">barracks</span>...uh...I give it to her. </sentence><sentence id="1137">Uh... They...uh...what they did, when we walked out the other way...uh...it was a selection. </sentence><sentence id="1138">In other words, not all people survived. </sentence><sentence id="1139">They were selecting...uh...one left, one right. </sentence><sentence id="1140">There was...the guy that was doing the selection was Eichmann. </sentence><sentence id="1141">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1142">He had a...uh...he had helpers. </sentence><sentence id="1143">Of course, the Ukrainians and there were two girls. </sentence><sentence id="1144">I don't remember the other one, but one girl she was German. </sentence><sentence id="1145">When I got out from there, he was standing right there. </sentence><sentence id="1146">We were naked. </sentence><sentence id="1147">Can you imagine how a person feels, especially a woman, in front...no matter how...how bad the situation is, whatever...I mean we practically lost our minds at...at moments like that. </sentence><sentence id="1148">But still the fact that we were naked in front of a man whoever it may have been, it was devastating and especially for a teenager that is modest. </sentence><sentence id="1149">And when I saw that I...I was confused. </sentence><sentence id="1150">I didn't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="1151">He was standing there with a...with a dog. </sentence><sentence id="1152">He had this horse whip which was thick and, you know, all leather to the end, very thin at the end, and he was going left, right, left, right, left, right. </sentence><sentence id="1153">Well, L...I don't know...I cannot say that I was brave. </sentence><sentence id="1154">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1155">Maybe I was just not experienced. </sentence><sentence id="1156">And I simply went to him because when I saw that he took my mother on the other side, I started begging him. </sentence><sentence id="1157">I says, "Please" I says, "This is the only person left in my life. </sentence><sentence id="1158">I haven't got anybody anymore." </sentence><sentence id="1159">I says, "Please. </sentence><sentence id="1160">Put me together with my mother. </sentence><sentence id="1161">We will work harder together. </sentence><sentence id="1162">We will be more loyal and whatever." </sentence><sentence id="1163">Well, he put me together with my mother. </sentence><sentence id="1164">That means going to...to the <span class="dlf">concen</span>...to the...to the <span class="spatial object">ovens</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1165">Well, the girl somehow took pity on me. </sentence><sentence id="1166">I don't...with this girl I had several other incidences too because I must say that as bad as they were and I wouldn't want to say anything special for the Germans as a whole, but I...I must say that on occasions, you found a person with feelings and compassion and they did special things. </sentence><sentence id="1167">Maybe it was not a great effort to them, but was a lifesaving to us. </sentence><sentence id="1168">Well, this girl was about my age and...and I went to  USHMM Archives RG-50.030*250 17 her and at that point I looked already like a <span class="spatial object">balloon</span> because he used the pa...the....uh...whip on me. </sentence><sentence id="1169">And not on my body, but the upper body, on my face. </sentence><sentence id="1170">My eyes were swollen. </sentence><sentence id="1171">I had little <span class="dlf">slits</span> here that I could only see, but I was so desperate that I talked and I...in German I said to her, I says, "You are the same age as I am and I am sure and I hope that your parents are at least safe somewhere or you would want to know that they are safe. </sentence><sentence id="1172">And if anything like that happened to you, wouldn't you want to save your mother?" </sentence><sentence id="1173">And that's all I said to her. </sentence><sentence id="1174">And she took my mother and I and she smuggled us to the other <span class="region">side</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1175">We survived. </sentence><sentence id="1176">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="1177">They took us to...uh ...to <span class="building">barracks</span> and the next morning--or was it the same day actually, because time had no...no value whatsoever--and this is where they...they put our...uh...marks. </sentence><sentence id="1178">It was A here. </sentence><sentence id="1179">That meant <span class="spatial object">transport A</span>, and then the number is 14028. </sentence><sentence id="1180">That was my number. </sentence><sentence id="1181">I went first for them to do it because I wanted to see how it felt. </sentence><sentence id="1182">1 was worrying that mother would not be able to stand it or so. </sentence><sentence id="1183">So it...it worried me. </sentence><sentence id="1184">I went first and mother was...mother's number was the following number <span class="spatial object">A-14029</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1185">And we were given numbers and we stayed in the <span class="building">barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1186">So we were in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> already. </sentence><sentence id="1187">The first day before they put us into our regular <span class="building">barrack</span>, they put us... they put us into a <span class="building">barrack</span> which was called <span class="building">Death Barrack</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1188">Uh...they are standing. </sentence><sentence id="1189">The <span class="building">barracks</span> are preserved, and they are standing. </sentence><sentence id="1190">They put us over there temporarily, but usually when you put people there that means they were going to...to die. </sentence><sentence id="1191">But they had <span class="spatial object">transport</span> coming one after the other, one after the other, and they had no time to kill everybody like that because the procedure, no matter how fast they have developed it to be, ...uh...did not work as fast as they would want it to work. </sentence><sentence id="1192">So, we were in that <span class="building">barrack</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1193">I saw it...uh ...recently. </sentence><sentence id="1194">It had a <span class="dlf">court yard</span>, also surrounded with bricks. </sentence><sentence id="1195">At the end of the <span class="dlf">court yard</span> on the <span class="dlf">brick wall</span>, there was a big plate, steel plate attached to the <span class="dlf">wall</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1196">Against this, I was told that--when I was there a year and a half ago, about two years ago--I was told that this what they were doing. </sentence><sentence id="1197">I had no idea that they were doing it while I was in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, but that <span class="spatial object">steel block</span> was there because they were shooting people, putting them against the <span class="spatial object">steel block</span> and shooting them. </sentence><sentence id="1198">That way the <span class="dlf">brick wall</span> would not fall apart and I realized that the whole <span class="dlf">yard</span> was drenched with blood. </sentence><sentence id="1199">And we looked at it and feelings come back. </sentence><sentence id="1200">Expression was motionless, but the feelings were there. </sentence><sentence id="1201">And I looked. </sentence><sentence id="1202">Then I went to...they have a place where they have so-called archives...uh...and stuff that were of some importance, like letters or writings or pictures or something. </sentence><sentence id="1203">Well, the pictures that I mentioned earlier in my journey to <span class="populated place">Wierzbnik</span> and from <span class="populated place">Wierzbnik</span> after I was shot that I saved them, I still had them because I was able
