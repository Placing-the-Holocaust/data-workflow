<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="339">Q: What did you find when you arrived in <span class="populated place">Frankfurt</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="341">A: Well, uh I uh I found that the Army had planned uh fully as to what to do with any survivors who might be found in <span class="populated place">German concentration camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="342">There had been set up a combined displaced persons executive, which was a large <span class="building">office</span> staffed by a number of officers. </sentence><sentence id="343">There was a general who was in charge, General Nicholson. </sentence><sentence id="344">Uh this combined DP executive was under the general command of uh the G5 on General Eisenhower's staff, General Adcock (ph), and they were doing a good job in following the plans that had been prepared a long time before. </sentence><sentence id="345">Those plans said simply that the survivors found in <span class="populated place">German concentration camps</span> should be quickly sent back to the <span class="region">lands</span> of their origin. </sentence><sentence id="346">And indeed French and, and Belgian and Greek and other nationals found in the <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span> within ninety days were sent back to their homelands. </sentence><sentence id="347">But what the planners had not thought of was number one there would be German Jews and Austrian Jews and Hungarian Jews who came from <span class="country">countries</span> that were considered enemy countries by the American Army, so they were enemy nationalists, and nobody had planned for enemy nationalists to be found in the <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="348">The irony was that the Germans, the Hungarians, uh the Austrians had deprived these Jews of their German, Austrian, Hungarian citizenship, but now they were given that citizenship again because to do otherwise would be to follow the practice of of the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="349">And so they were enemy nationalists. </sentence><sentence id="350">That was one problem. </sentence><sentence id="351">The second problem was, and this was a far greater problem, the planners, the military planners had never contemplated the possibility that there would be survivors who were, who would be Jews who would refuse to return to the <span class="region">lands</span> of their origin. </sentence><sentence id="352">Polish Jews. </sentence><sentence id="353">Ukrainian Jews. </sentence><sentence id="354">Lithuanian, Estonian Jews. </sentence><sentence id="355">Uh Hungarian Jews. </sentence><sentence id="356">Romanian Jews. </sentence><sentence id="357">Because they knew that their <span class="building">homes</span>, their <span class="building">businesses</span> that they once had had in their <span class="region">lands of origin</span> had been seized by their erstwhile neighbors. </sentence><sentence id="358">They knew also that in many cases their former non-Jewish neighbors had cooperated with the Nazis in turning in their Jewish neighbors. </sentence><sentence id="359">Indeed in helping the Nazis ship their Jewish neighbors to <span class="populated place">death camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="360">They knew that it would be dangerous even to return to the <span class="region">lands</span> of their origin. </sentence><sentence id="361">They were concerned less their neighbors now in possession of <span class="building">Jewish homes</span> and <span class="building">businesses</span> attack them, as indeed happened. </sentence><sentence id="362">Moreover, psychologically these Jews, survivors of <span class="populated place">German concentration camps</span>, knew that the very <span class="region">land</span>, the very <span class="env feature">soil</span> where they had once lived was now a <span class="env feature">soil</span> that absorbed the blood of their children and their parents and their spouses. </sentence><sentence id="363">That the very <span class="env feature">air</span> was polluted with the smoke of the <span class="building">crematoria</span> where Jews had been burned. </sentence><sentence id="364">They had no desire to return to the <span class="region">lands</span> from which they had come. </sentence><sentence id="365">Now it was the problems of these Jews in particular that had not been thought of in advance. </sentence><sentence id="366">Therefore the Army indeed did not take care properly of these Jewish survivors. </sentence><sentence id="367">It This

of these survivors and that so-called enemy nationals who were Jewish and who had suffered under the Nazis should be taken care of as victims of the Nazis, that the whole situation was turned around. </sentence><sentence id="370">And a part of that turning around of the situation involved my being ordered to take on the duties of visiting these <span class="populated place">camps</span>, seeing what the conditions were, bringing back my reports to General Eisenhower or in his absence to his Chief of Staff, General Walter Beetle Smith. </sentence><sentence id="371">And to recommend changes in

</sentence><sentence id="412">Uh can you tell me, what was your first assignment? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="413">A: Well, my first assignment was to meet of course with the uh uh officers who were the staff of the combined displaced persons executive. </sentence><sentence id="414">And I spent oh the better part of a week uh learning what my job was to, to consist of. </sentence><sentence id="415">I read through a lot of uh files and I had long discussions uh with uh the several officers who were a part of the combined DP executive and then I uh compiled for myself a list of questions that would be a questionnaire for me when I would arrive in a <span class="populated place">displaced persons camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="416">The questions would have to do with uh <span class="building">housing</span>, food, sanitary conditions, medical conditions, health of people and uh the like and where did these people want to go. </sentence><sentence id="417">What did they see as the solution, the ultimate solution to their problems. </sentence><sentence id="418">So armed with this questionnaire, I started off on my first tour. </sentence><sentence id="419">And I went first to <span class="populated place">Bavaria</span> uh then under the command of the 3"! </sentence><sentence id="420">Army, whose commanding general was General George Patton. </sentence><sentence id="421">And uh General Patton had appointed a Major Schaffer (ph) as his displaced persons officer on his staff in <span class="populated place">Munich</span>, which was the headquarters of the 3rd Army. </sentence><sentence id="422">Well, I went to <span class="region">Bavaria</span> and I headed first for <span class="populated place">Feldafing</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="423">Now why <span class="populated place">Feldafing</span>? </sentence><sentence id="424">Because in the report of Dean Harrison, <span class="populated place">Feldafing</span> had been praised. </sentence><sentence id="425">Indeed uh Dean Harrison had stated that <span class="building">Feldafing</span> should be the model for other <span class="populated place">DP camps</span> in the <span class="region">American zone</span> of <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="426">I went to <span class="populated place">Feldafing</span>. </sentence><sentence id="427">I found uh over five thousand Jews there and the Army contingent in charge was headed by a Lieutenant Irving Smith. </sentence><sentence id="428">Now Irving Smith was a very able and efficient Army officer. </sentence><sentence id="429">He was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="430">He was sympathetic to the plight of the survivors. </sentence><sentence id="431">And yet the Jews of the <span class="populated place">camp</span> voiced to me through a committee whom they had chosen, their complaints about Lieutenant Smith. </sentence><sentence id="432">Why? </sentence><sentence id="433">Well, because he issued orders without consulting with the committee. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="434">He, well that that was his job. </sentence><sentence id="435">He was an Army officer. </sentence><sentence id="436">And he wasn't trained to be in charge of a group of civilians in dire need. </sentence><sentence id="437">But as I went around through the <span class="populated place">camp</span> with the committee, the Jewish committee, I was appalled by what I had seen. </sentence><sentence id="438">Why was I so upset? </sentence><sentence id="439">Because <span class="populated place">Feldafing</span>, which had been held up by Dean Harrison as the <span class="populated place">model camp</span>, was severely over-crowded. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="440">There were uh a number of, of uh <span class="building">barracks</span> that were completely unfit for human habitation. </sentence><sentence

</sentence><sentence id="442">Certainly as I thought of the coming winter, people couldn't be housed in, under such conditions. </sentence><sentence id="443">In addition, there was severe crowding in all of the <span class="building">barracks</span> where the Jews were living. </sentence><sentence id="444">Remember, this was not a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>.

which had been constructed originally for foreign workers who had come into <span class="country">Germany</span>, who came into <span class="country">Germany</span> from such <span class="country">countries</span> uh as <span class="country">Poland</span> and <span class="country">Yugoslavia</span> and <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> and <span class="country">Hungary</span>. </sentence><sentence id="450">Many of them were brought by the Germans as slave labor to work in <span class="building">German industry</span> while the Germans themselves were in the German Army. </sentence><sentence id="451">Some had volunteered to come because of their sympathy with the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="452">Well, now these foreign workers were also displaced persons. </sentence><sentence id="453">They claimed the status of displaced persons. </sentence><sentence id="454">And their <span class="building">housing</span> that had been used for them was now being used by Jewish displaced persons. </sentence><sentence id="455">And I thought the conditions in, in <span class="populated place">Feldafing</span> were deplorable. </sentence><sentence id="456">And I wondered how bad could the conditions be elsewhere if <span class="populated place">Feldafing</span> had been praised by Dean Harrison as a model <span class="populated place">DP camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="457">I found out why Harrison praised <span class="populated place">Feldafing</span>, and that was because <span class="populated place">Feldafing</span> at that time was almost unique in that it was an <span class="populated place">all-Jewish camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="458">Now other <span class="populated place">camps</span> where Jewish survivors were being housed were <span class="populated place">camps</span> where non-Jews were also being housed. </sentence><sentence id="459">Who were these non-Jews? </sentence><sentence id="460">They were the foreign workers I mentioned a moment ago. </sentence><sentence id="461">In many cases they were sympathetic to the Jews, but in most cases they were anti-Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="462">Many of them were, had been sympathetic to the Nazi cause, had volunteered to come as workers to <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="463">Moreover they had been fed well and housed well and clothed well, all through the years of the war and what the Jewish survivors of <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span> required was not what they needed. </sentence><sentence id="464">And to give the Jews in the <span class="populated place">camps</span> where they were housed with the non-Jews special treatment, more food than the others got, better clothing than the others had gotten, more medical attention than the others received, would be unthinkable. </sentence><sentence id="465">It would, it could create riots, that the Jews were getting special treatment. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="466">Never mind that the Jews needed the special attention. </sentence><sentence id="467">It was the Jews who had suffered under the Nazi severely in the <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>, not the foreign workers. </sentence><sentence id="468">But it was an impossible situation. </sentence><sentence id="469">So what Dean Harrison had recommended was that <span class="populated place">camps</span> should be set up with Feldafing as a model, that is they should be all <span class="populated place">Jewish camps</span> and they should have a Jewish committee who would work together with whoever was in charge of the <span class="populated place">camps</span>, whether it would be uh a military group or an company or workers from the <span class="building">Joint Distribution Committee</span>  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact

class="populated place">camp</span> for a certain number of hours. </sentence><sentence id="471">The Jews in the <span class="populated place">camps</span> looked out and saw Germans who were, were the enemies of the Americans, Germans who had placed them in <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>, walking freely on the <span class="dlf">roads</span>, on the <span class="dlf">highways</span>. </sentence><sentence id="472">They were not behind <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span>. </sentence><sentence id="473">They didn't have, have to ask anybody for a pass to walk around freely. </sentence><sentence id="474">They, the Jews, who had been so severely treated by the Germans, were still behind <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span> and had to ask for permission to have a few hours of freedom outside the <span class="populated place">DP camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="475">Well, uh I must say that uh General Eisenhower acted quickly on all these recommendations. </sentence><sentence id="476">Orders were done quickly to General Patton to correct these situations and I had a uh vivid illustration of how at least in one instance if not in others, the orders were not carried out by General Patton. </sentence><sentence id="477">Generally speaking, had Eisenhower's orders beginning with his August 22nd initial order correcting the situation been carried out on all the lower levels of command, the situation for Jewish survivors in <span class="country">Germany</span> would have changed radically quickly. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="478">Unfortunately there was a wide <span class="dlf">gap</span> between the <span class="building">headquarters</span> in <span class="populated place">Frankfurt</span> and the military units dealing with the Jewish displaced persons, and with all the intermediary levels through which the orders had to pass, including General Patton's <span class="building">headquarters</span> in <span class="populated place">Munich</span>. </sentence><sentence id="479">And so, for example, when I went back again on my second trip to <span class="populated place">Bavaria</span>, the Jews complained to me that the <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span> still existed. </sentence><sentence id="480">The <span class="dlf">pass system</span> had not been changed, and when I came back to <span class="populated place">Frankfurt</span>, I reported that to General Walter Beetle Smith. </sentence><sentence id="481">Soon afterwards I came into the <span class="interior space">anteroom</span> to General Eisenhower Eisen-uh-hower's <span class="building">headquarters</span>, to his <span class="building">office</span>, and I saw General Patton sitting in the <span class="interior space">anteroom</span> at eight o'clock in the morning when the Army day began in <span class="country">Germany</span>, and I knew that I must be the reason for his being there. </sentence><sentence id="482">I had reported that he had not carried out Eisenhower's order with regard to the removal of the pass system and the <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span>. </sentence><sentence id="483">I saw him sitting there with his pearl-handled pistols, one on each side of him, with his shiny helmet and boots. </sentence><sentence id="484">He glared at me with distaste and I beat a quick diplomatic retreat out of the <span class="building">office</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="485">Later General Smith told me that what had happened was that when he had reported to Eisenhower that I had said that Patton had not carried out the orders about the removal of the <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span> and the pass system, Eisenhower had instructed General Smith to call General Patton to have him report the following morning at eight o'clock. </sentence><sentence id="486">General Patton had to ride overnight from <span class="populated place">Munich</span> to <span class="populated place">Frankfurt</span> to be there at eight o'clock in the morning, and later when General Eisenhower saw him, General Eisenhower said to Patton after reminding him of the <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span> and the pass system and his not carrying out Eisenhower's orders with regard to them, General Eisenhower asked him, George, why don't you do something for these Jews? </sentence><sentence id="487">And General Patton replied thinking that he was talking to his buddy, his close friend with whom he had gone to <span

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="803">A: Well uh, Ben Gurion went on his way to cover the major <span class="populated place">DP camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="804">I went to the <span class="building">railroad station</span> to meet Judge Rifkin who was arriving on the <span class="spatial object">military train</span> from <span class="populated place">Paris</span>, and later I learned that when Ben Gurion came back, and I saw him again when he came back to <span class="building">Army headquarters</span> in <span class="populated place">Frankfurt</span> before he departed, he gave General Eisenhower, as the general had requested, a report on his findings. </sentence><sentence id="805">He requested certain things that the Jewish DPs had asked of me which I knew could not happen. </sentence><sentence id="806">For example, he asked that the Jews be taken out of the <span class="populated place">DP camps</span>, that whole <span class="populated place">German villages</span> should be requisitioned for them, that the German occupants of the <span class="building">housing</span> in those <span class="populated place">villages</span> be evicted, and that the, the Jewish displaced persons be brought to take the <span class="building">houses</span> of the Germans evicted from their <span class="building">homes</span> in these <span class="populated place">villages</span>. </sentence><sentence id="807">I knew that would be turned down by Eisenhower, and I myself never made that recommendation. </sentence><sentence id="808">Ben Gurion did.

class="Question"><p><sentence id="813">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="814">Uh can you at this point tell me something about General Eisenhower and your relationship with him? </sentence><sentence id="815">What was he like? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="816">A: I'm glad you asked that question. </sentence><sentence id="817">Uh General Eisenhower, I learned years later when he received an honorary degree at the <span class="building">Jewish Theological Seminary of America</span>, spoke of the fact that he and his brothers were raised by their mother on the stories of what he called the Old Testament, and he grew up believing that the Jews were indeed the chosen people. </sentence><sentence id="818">And that they were the first to bring to humanity the divine message of ethics and morality. </sentence><sentence id="819">I got to know him through the humanitarian approach that he took to the improvement of the Jewish survivors in the <span class="populated place">DP camps</span> in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="820">At the very beginning he cut through what was a gordion (ph) knot with which generals at <span class="building">American Army headquarters</span> were wrestling for a long time. </sentence><sentence id="821">The <span class="dlf">gordion knot</span> consisted of the old question, who are the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="822">A question that has been given much attention by scholars of all kinds. </sentence><sentence id="823">Are the Jews a <span class="country">nation</span>? </sentence><sentence id="824">Are they a religious grouping?Are they arace? </sentence><sentence id="825">Are they a people? </sentence><sentence id="826">On the one hand it was argued that the Jews could not be given special attention in the <span class="populated place">DP camps</span> because you couldn't look upon them as Jews. </sentence><sentence id="827">There were either German nationals or Austrian nationals or Polish nationals or Czech nationals. </sentence><sentence id="828">And if you were to look upon them as Jews and deprive them of their nationality, were you not doing the same thing that the Nazis had done, of robbing them of their citizenship, and looking upon them as a racial group. </sentence><sentence id="829">On the other hand, how could you help them if you did not look upon them as a special separate group. </sentence><sentence id="830">Well, Eisenhower cut through that <span class="dlf">gordion knot</span> and when he received these several communications from <span class="populated place">Washington</span>, from General Marshall, from Secretary Stimpson, and I must stress from President Truman, that the situation must be corrected, Eisenhower at once made up his mind he was going to stop with all of this argument, all of this debate, and he was going to treat the Jews as a separate group. </sentence><sentence id="831">And German Jews and Austrian Jews and Italian Jews were no longer to be enemy nationals, but victims, and to be treated as victims of the Nazis and the Jews who didn't want to go back to their homelands, they were to be treated as a special group, given special help, brought back to the level of ordinary common place health of human beings and because he did that, I credit him with the speedy rehabilitation of the Jewish survivors. </sentence><sentence id="832">He came to speak at the <span class="building">Park Avenue Synagogue</span> at my invitation in May of 1965. </sentence><sentence id="833">By that time he had been President of the <span class="country">United States</span>, and he was living in <span class="populated place">Gettysburg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="834">I telephoned him and I asked him would he come to speak at a special service at my <span class="building">synagogue</span> commemorating the 20th anniversary of the liberation of the <span class="populated place">German concentration camps</span> by the American Army under his command. </sentence><sentence id="835">He agreed to come. </sentence><sentence id="836">In introducing him to my congregation, I said to them, I want to tell you one story about this man which will be sufficient to tell you about his character, his humanitarianism, and his answer to the difficult Jewish problem. </sentence><sentence id="837">I said when we, when the German arm...when the American Army liberated the <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span> in <span class="country">Germany</span>, there were definitions of who was a displaced person. </sentence><sentence id="838">Who was a displaced person who would benefit from <span class="building">housing</span>, food, clothing and all the rest under the aegis of the American Army. </sentence><sentence id="839">The displaced person was defined as a survivor, in this case particularly a Jewish survivor, liberated in a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> on <span class="region">German soil</span>. </sentence><sentence id="840">But soon there came into the <span class="region">American zone</span> of <span class="country">Germany</span>, other Jews. </sentence><sentence id="841">Jews who had been in hiding in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="842">Jews who had been shoved back by the Russians behind the <span class="dlf">front lines</span>, all the way back to <span class="region">Siberia</span>, an action that actually saved their lives. </sentence><sentence id="843">Now these This is a verbatim

</sentence><sentence id="846">They found that their <span class="building">homes</span> and their <span class="building">businesses</span> could not be reclaimed. </sentence><sentence id="847">They discovered that their loved ones had been murdered by the Nazis and the Polish or Ukrainian or Lithuanian helpers and they no longer wanted to try to make out, to make a new life where they had

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="885">Q: How did Eisenhower react to this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="887">A: Ah, this is a major point that I wanted to make. </sentence><sentence id="888">When these Jews started coming across the <span class="dlf">borders</span> to enter the <span class="region">American zone</span> of <span class="country">Germany</span>, Eisenhower was asked by the commanders on lower levels, what shall we do with these refugees who are coming into our <span class="region">zone</span> in such large numbers. </sentence><sentence id="889">I was asked for a recommendation. </sentence><sentence id="890">The recommendation of course was that they be admitted into the <span class="populated place">DP camps</span> in the <span class="region">American zone</span> of <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="891">General Eisenhower approved that recommendation. </sentence><sentence id="892">Eighty thousand Jews came in, and Eisenhower, by that one order of approval, contributed to the saving of eighty thousand Jewish lives. </sentence><sentence id="893">Now my friendship with him continued after the war. </sentence><sentence id="894">I was asked to help write items of interest in his campaign for the presidency, such as his Rosh Hashanah message during the campaign. </sentence><sentence id="895">My wife and I were invited to the Inauguration. </sentence><sentence id="896">Before that time I was invited to give an invocation at the Republican National Convention that had that had nominated him. </sentence><sentence id="897">I had him at my <span class="building">synagogue</span>, but before that I had visited him at <span class="populated place">Gettysburg</span> at his <span class="dlf">farm</span>, so we remained in close contact all through the years. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="909">Q: How did Eisenhower, did you and Eisenhower at the time you made this recommendation, did you talk to him face to face? </sentence><sentence id="910">What did he say to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="913">A: I did not in most instances have the opportunity of speaking to him face to face. </sentence><sentence id="914">I did often. </sentence><sentence id="915">I did have the privilege of coming to his <span class="building">office</span>, speaking to him face to face, most of the times answering his questions. </sentence><sentence id="916">When he was not in his <span class="building">office</span>, and that was, that occurred frequently, he would be out on a field trip, then my conversations were with the second in command, his chief of staff General Walter Beetle Smith. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="921">Q: Did Eisenhower ever talk to you about the Jews and his feelings about Jews? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="923">A: I did have occasion to hear such remarks from Eisenhower. </sentence><sentence id="924">He always spoke in an affirmative fashion. </sentence><sentence id="925">He always condemned every kind of bigotry and prejudice. </sentence><sentence id="926">He hated what the Nazis had done. </sentence><sentence id="927">He issued orders, after he had first visited <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>, that American military commanders should bring their units to see <span class="populated place">Dachau</span> so that the troops might know what they had been fighting against. </sentence><sentence id="928">He visited <span class="populated place">Feldafing</span> on Yom Kippur, spoke to the Jews assembled there, told them of his high admiration for them, for the Jewish people and for Judaism, and urged them to keep their hope high, that they still had a future. </sentence><sentence id="929">Eisenhower was that kind of personality. </sentence></p></dialogue>

</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="947">A: Well the first thing I did was to escort Judge Rifkin on a tour of all the <span class="populated place">camps</span>, to introduce him to all of my contacts among the Jews in the <span class="populated place">camps</span>, to tell them that he was the person for them to speak to afterwards. </sentence><sentence id="948">I returned to the <span class="country">United States</span> on a <span class="spatial object">troop transport</span> and uh I came back to the <span class="country">United States</span> at the end of November, beginning of December in 1945.Before my return I had been visited at my <span class="building">headquarters</span> in uh <span class="populated place">Frankfurt</span> by uh Major Edward Warburg (ph) who was at that time the president of the <span class="building">Joint Distribution Committee</span>, and he was good enough to invite me. </sentence><sentence id="949">After I would be discharged from the Army, to become a member of the staff of the <span class="building">JDC</span>. </sentence><sentence id="950">He even suggested that I would be appointed Director of JDC

the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="952">Soon afterwards I was asked to speak at the annual meeting of the <span class="building">Joint Distribution Committee</span> in <span class="populated place">New York</span>. </sentence><sentence id="953">I was full of vehement indignation at what I had seen. </sentence><sentence id="954">I had, I contrasted that with what I had found among American Jews when I returned. </sentence><sentence id="955">There was very little awareness among American Jews of what had happened to their fellow Jews in <span class="country">Europe</span>. </sentence><sentence id="956">Very few were aware of it, and very few were concerned about it, naturally, because they didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="957">So I was angry and at my uh, I was asked to speak at the annual meeting of the JDC and I'm afraid that I gave voice to my anger at that meeting, but to my surprise I was asked to give an address the following week at the annual meeting of the United Jewish Appeal to take place in <span class="populated place">Atlantic City</span> where an unheard of goal was to be proclaimed, a goal of $100,000,000 to be raised during 1946 among the Jews of the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="958">Of course I uh accepted the invitation. </sentence><sentence id="959">I addressed the UJA Conference in <span class="populated place">Atlantic City</span> the following week, and I was asked the next morning to have breakfast with the leaders of the JDC and the UJA who were there at that conference, and at the <span class="spatial object">breakfast table</span> I was told that I was being relieved of the employment I was to have with the <span class="building">JDC</span>. </sentence><sentence id="960">Instead I was asked to accept employment with the United Jewish Appeal and to be a speaker for the hundred million dollar campaign from which of course the JDC would be receiving its funds. </sentence><sentence id="961">And I agreed and for the next six months I spoke in forty different <span class="region">states</span> of the <span
