<body><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1">Q: Rabbi Weiner, when we finished up with your earlier interview, you were talking about after Kristallnacht, in December of 1938, you went to <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span> and stayed with your sister for about a week, who was living there. </sentence><sentence id="2">What happened after that and at that point, did you know where the rest of your family was and did you have any contact with them? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3">A: My family was, my whole family was in <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4">My brother who had run away from <span class="populated place">Bremen</span> had also come to <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5">My sister, as I mentioned before, had been working with the family in <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>, so they were all in <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="9">Q: Your father? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="11">A: My father was also in <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="12">After, about a week or so after the Shiva, my father and I returned to <span class="populated place">Bremen</span> and we were living in the same <span class="building">house</span> where we had lived before. </sentence><sentence id="13">We were searching the <span class="building">house</span> and we found the bullet which had killed my mother and we found everything upside-down, we put the whole <span class="building">house</span> in order and we were living there and repairing as much as possible. </sentence><sentence id="14">In addition we tried to emigrate and find a place where to emigrate. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="19">Q: And what were the results of that effort? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="21">A: We had written to several people before, but the answers were usually, we have no money, we have no place, we like to help you, but we can't. </sentence><sentence id="22">Now after Kristallnacht, which was on November ninth to the 10th, 1938 of November, we wrote again to these people and we told them about my mother and especially my father's cousin, who was living in Yorktown(ph), <span class="region">Saskatchewan</span>, if he could do anything about it. </sentence><sentence id="23">This time we got a letter from him, that he would talk to the member of Parliament in <span class="country">Canada</span> and find how to get us special permission. </sentence><sentence id="24">And he would then send us what is called a landing card, that we were allowed to <span class="dlf">land</span>. </sentence><sentence id="25">After a few weeks, we got this landing card. </sentence><sentence id="26">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="27">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="28"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Now the question was to leave <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="29">You needed first of all, permission from the German government and they would be there when we would pack our things. </sentence><sentence id="30">But first of all we had to get tickets to go to <span class="country">Canada</span>. </sentence><sentence id="31">My father went to the Norstorchalloit(ph), which is a <span class="building">shipping company</span> in <span class="country">Germany</span>, and they said, since the Germans wanted us to take a German company, they told us they were all booked up for two years. </sentence><sentence id="32">We did not want to wait for two years, so my father went to <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span> again and <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span> had that, <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span> had a connection with British Airline, with the British, not airline, with the <span class="dlf">British shipping line</span>, the <span class="dlf">Koolnot(ph) Whitestar(ph) line</span> and he met a man from there and he said he would get us <span class="dlf">passage</span> to <span class="country">Canada</span>. </sentence><sentence id="33">However, to get there, we needed first to go by <span class="spatial object">ferry boat</span>, from <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span> to <span class="country">England</span> and from <span class="country">England</span> to <span class="populated place">Southampton</span>, we would take a <span class="spatial object">boat</span> to <span class="country">Canada</span>. </sentence><sentence id="34">When the <span class="spatial object">landing cart</span> came, we gave it to him and he prepared us and he arranged for all the necessary things in order for us to travel to <span class="country">Canada</span>. </sentence><sentence id="35">We were traveling five people, my father, myself, my two brothers and my sister. </sentence><sentence id="36">But we needed money for the tickets. </sentence><sentence id="37">In order to do this, we had to sell our <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="38">Now there was one woman, --__ woman, who the Nazi's had planted into our <span class="building">house</span>, she wanted to buy it. </sentence><sentence id="39">Of course she bought it with very little money, just enough money to pay for the tickets. </sentence><sentence id="40">So we had the tickets and we set our date, I mean in fact the date was set by the <span class="building">shipping company</span>, for May 31, 1939. </sentence><sentence id="41">On that day we would leave <span class="country">Germany</span> with the <span class="spatial object">ferry boat</span>. </sentence><sentence id="42">Many other things happened between December and May, 1939. </sentence><sentence id="43">For instance, one thing which happened was in January, 1939. </sentence><sentence id="44">On the 18th of January, which was the Kaiser's birthday, before Hitler came to power, I got it, I was visiting a friend of ours, the family Greenberg(ph) and just about 10 o'clock I got a telegram which said, "Come to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>." </sentence><sentence id="45">I didn't know originally from whom it came, but it came from a friend of mine who was working with a Jewish organization, the same I had been working for and I knew that I would go to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> and go to this organization. </sentence><sentence id="46">He said to me, my, the family I was working, I was visiting, said to me, "Go there This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="47">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="48"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection right away." </sentence><sentence id="49">So it was 10 o'clock in the evening, I went to the <span class="building">train station</span> and the next <span class="spatial object">train</span> was going at 12 at night, so I took that <span class="spatial object">night train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="50">But it was a very uncomfortable trip because there were the Nazis walking in and out and I didn't want to be recognized as a Jew at that time, so I walked around the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="51">It was what we call a <span class="spatial object">express train</span>, where there is a <span class="interior space">hallway</span> at the side and then there are <span class="interior space">cabins</span> in there. </sentence><sentence id="52">So next morning, about seven o'clock, I arrived in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, it wasn't my first time in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="53">It was a very rainy day and a dark day and I just started to walk. </sentence><sentence id="54">I came to the <span class="dlf">Brandenberger(ph) gate</span>, which I had not seen for, at all, only in pictures before and there was a sign that Jews enter this at their own risk and Jews are forbidden to enter this, but I walked very quickly through, there was no one really watching me and I walked to this place of our organization, I came to the <span class="interior space">fourth floor</span> and I saw some friends of mine, they said yes, thank you for coming, we are waiting you, the Nazis have told us that if we make out certain affidavits, which were fake of course, that our friends, young people you see, would have a chance to go to <span class="country">Lithuania</span>, <span class="country">Estonia</span> and <span class="country">Latvia</span>, to the <span class="region">Baltic states</span> and they would go there on Hashera(ph), Hashera(ph) means preparation for emigration to <span class="country">Israel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="55">Then they would recognize us and they would go there. </sentence><sentence id="56">So the whole day we were typing out, with the type machine, of course they had no electric typing machines at that time, we were typing out letters with names and birthdays and we said that they had permission, they were accepted to the Hashera(ph) in <span class="country">Latvia</span>, I still have some letters in my files, and we gave them to the Nazis, about 200 people or so were freed from <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> and they came out. </sentence><sentence id="57">However, not everyone of these 200 people or so survived, because afterwards the Nazis conquered <span class="country">Estonia</span> and <span class="country">Latvia</span> and <span class="country">Lithuania</span> and you see and then they came into their hands, but some of them might have. </sentence><sentence id="58">So that was in January. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="99">Q: Now, I want to ask you a few questions about what you've just described. </sentence><sentence id="100">First of all, were you at this point, supposed to be identified as a Jew, did you wear a, were you wearing bands? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="103"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="104">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="105"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="106">A: No, no, they didn't have this, only in 1941 they made them, they made them wear the yellow star. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="108">Q: And in terms of this operation in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, what was this organization? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="110">A: It was a Jewish organization called Agoutis(ph) <span class="country">Israel</span> and they were trying, like everyone else, trying to get Jews out. </sentence><sentence id="111">Sometimes you could find a Nazi who was a little bit softer and her would accept such a fake document, you see they knew that it was fake, everyone knew it was fake, because especially the <span class="region">South American countries</span>, <span class="region">Latin American countries</span> were working very much with fake and with money, bribes and so forth, because I went to the South American diplomats very many times and they said to me, "Give us 400 dollars or so on, so much and we will let you out." </sentence><sentence id="112">So I went, oh we don't do it, go to that <span class="building">company</span>, to that <span class="country">country</span> and they were all working together. </sentence><sentence id="113">Many times that's what happened and you know this from your history, people went out and they were not permitted in that <span class="country">country</span> because they said we don't, these are illegal certificates, and they had to be sent back, like it happened with many <span class="country">countries</span>. </sentence><sentence id="114">But the Nazi's were very smart and they recognized the Jew, as I mentioned once before, in the class you see, either by the nose, or by the ears or by the color of the hair or by the form of the head, because they measured them all. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="120">Q: This organization that you were working with in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, was this in place for years, was this an outgrowth of political organizations you were involved with? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="122">A: No, they had nothing to do with politics, actually. </sentence><sentence id="123">They were more or less a Jewish ____--s more, I would say more religious kind of organization than another kind of organization. </sentence><sentence id="124">But all organizations tried somehow to bring their members or to bring Jews out, because I can tell you, later on when I, all right, that comes later. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="128">Q: Were you, my question is, were you affiliated with this organization or similar organizations, years before? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="130">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="131">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="132"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="133">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="134">I was already, I was already affiliated with this organization since 1934. </sentence><sentence id="135">They had such an organization in <span class="populated place">Bremen</span>, where I was living at that time, you see and it was at first a Zionist organization with which I was affiliated, however, I separated from them, because of religious reasons and then there was a special teacher in <span class="populated place">Bremen</span>, who taught us, a Hebrew teacher and he was from this organization, from Agoutis(ph) <span class="country">Israel</span> and I joined him. </sentence><sentence id="136">So I was already affiliated with this organization. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="141">Q: And in 1934, what was the basic theme of the, the focus of this organization? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="143">A: The focus was to work for the Jews to go to <span class="country">Israel</span>, mainly at that time, you see and also religiously, to make an organization where the people, where the Jews especially, became more religious instead of assimilation. </sentence><sentence id="144">It was a question of assimilation. </sentence><sentence id="145">It was a question of assimilation, emancipation. </sentence><sentence id="146">That's why the Zionist organizations, they were more of the type of uniting with the others and of so forth, where as this one was more individualized, by themselves. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="151">Q: And you felt that was important? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="153">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="154">Because as I had mentioned before, I said to the teacher when they changed this, the <span class="building">school</span> days, from Saturday, from Shabbat, I said to him that I don't want to come to <span class="building">school</span> any more on Shabbat, because I want to become more Orthodox, like the Germans want to become, in quotation marks, more German. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="157">Q: And this was your, this was really your own past, not your family's? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="159">A: No, because my father was, was not as religious you see, as my mother and my mother came from a religious family you see, but my father did not keep all the laws, but he was just Jewish </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="160">Q: Back to Agoutis(ph) in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, was there any risk to what you were doing or was this basically authorized? </sentence></p><p><sentence id="161">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="162">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="163"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="164">A: It was not legally authorized, but everyone did it and the Nazis knew about it was be done, because the Nazis were interested at that time just to get the Jews out, until in 1941, when they had the final solution, you see and they didn't want them to _in there, they said, "The world does not take them, the world does not want them." </sentence><sentence id="165">As long as they saw a letter, you see, that another <span class="country">country</span> was taking them, that was enough for them and they would sometimes, not always, let these people go and go there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="168">Q: When you say you were able to help, maybe, a couple hundred people... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="170">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="172">Q: How, how were these people chosen from where they, from where did you find them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="174">A: They were no lists, however we had friends and we knew from our organization, let's say my organization in <span class="populated place">Bremen</span> at that time, I know names and besides is they had names, each one has names, each one of the people has some names, so they gave them the names and if people gave them different names, if friends gave them friends names, a friend, a friend, a friend, you see. </sentence><sentence id="175">So that's how they were choosing them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="178">Q: So you helped whoever you could? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="180">A: Whoever, yeah, </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="181">Q: And how did you know that somebody was in <span class="populated place">Sachsenhausen</span> or somebody was in <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>, or wherever? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="182">A: These people sometimes wrote. </sentence><sentence id="183">If they were in <span class="populated place">Sachsenhausen</span>, it say <span class="populated place">Sachsenhausen</span>, near <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="184">Or <span class="populated place">Dachau</span> near <span class="populated place">Munich</span>. </sentence><sentence id="185">They wrote and at that time, we knew where the people were, besides this, as I can tell you later, I had some contact with the Gestapo and they told me that, "We have people here in <span class="populated place">Sachsenhausen</span>," and so forth and forth. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="190">Q: How long did you work with Agoutis(ph) in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="192">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="193">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="194"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="195">A: I only stayed there one day, however in this one day, you see, we did a lot of things, because on this one day, we wrote all these letters and we brought them to the, to the Nazis and they let them go, most of them. </sentence><sentence id="196">And then I went back to <span class="populated place">Bremen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="197">I was still in contact with them afterwards, but this was a deadline, I think this 18th of January was a deadline that they gave us, so we came on that day and made it all final, in one day. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="201">Q: Busy day. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="203">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="205">Q: So you went back to <span class="populated place">Bremen</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="207">A: I went back to <span class="populated place">Bremen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="208">Now one day it happened, we were always afraid, especially at nighttime that they may knock at the <span class="dlf">door</span> and take us away and it happened one day, I think in, also in January one day they came, an ominous knock at the <span class="dlf">door</span> in the middle of the night. </sentence><sentence id="209">My brother who were, had, one of my brothers, who had remained in <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span> and they had sent him to the <span class="building">Jewish hospital</span> in <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="210">First he was in <span class="populated place">Sachsenhausen</span> and from <span class="populated place">Sachsenhausen</span>, somehow, they arranged with the <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>, I don't know who, how, but he was in the <span class="building">Jewish hospital</span> in <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="211">So one night, they knocked at the <span class="dlf">door</span> and I looked out of the <span class="dlf">window</span> and I made myself not known, but they continued knocking and I said, "What can I lose?" </sentence><sentence id="212">I go <span class="interior space">downstairs</span>, I open up. </sentence><sentence id="213">I didn't want to disturb my father, so I went <span class="interior space">downstairs</span>, I opened up and he came in, not in Nazi uniform, but in plain uniform, civil uniform and he said to him, we have here a search warrant for your brother, Benu(ph), his name. </sentence><sentence id="214">I said to them, "Don't you know that he is in the <span class="building">hospital</span> in <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>?" </sentence><sentence id="215">He made as if he didn't know anything, see, but come in and look through. </sentence><sentence id="216">They came through, they put upside-down the <span class="spatial object">beds</span> and this and they're all corner and then in the end I said, "You should have known that he is in <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span> in the <span class="building">hospital</span>." </sentence><sentence id="217">He said, "Yeah, excuse me" and they left. </sentence><sentence id="218">But they came in and they made a person scared, you know. </sentence><sentence id="219">They could always come in, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="220">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="221"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection middle of the night and knock at the <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="222">I went every morning, about six or seven o'clock, with a <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span>, we had a <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span>, to the <span class="building">synagogue</span>, which was about, by <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span>, 15 minutes away, 20 minutes away and sometimes Nazis saw me, but I didn't mind. </sentence><sentence id="223">So this was 1939, in January. </sentence><sentence id="224">In February, the congregation in <span class="populated place">Bremen</span>, the Jewish congregation in <span class="populated place">Bremen</span>, organized itself again and they had a temporary president, vice-president and, but they had no place any more to live, so there was this one family, I mentioned before this family Greenberg(ph) that was a different, a brother of this Greenberg and they had a <span class="building">house</span> in <span class="populated place">Bremen</span> and they had already left this <span class="building">house</span> in September 1938 and they had sold it, not even sold it, they had given it as a donation to the <span class="populated place">Bremen</span> congregation. </sentence><sentence id="225">I met him later on in <span class="populated place">New York</span>. </sentence><sentence id="226">But this was a <span class="building">house</span> in the old <span class="populated place">city</span> and there were maybe 20 families living in this <span class="building">house</span> now, besides that's the office of the congregation, was also in this <span class="building">house</span> and we organized it. </sentence><sentence id="227">So we re-organized it, the congregation, you made a few things. </sentence><sentence id="228">Number one, I worked with the HIAS, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society and made translations, I knew a little bit of English, not too much. </sentence><sentence id="229">Number two, we organized some courses for women in sewing and other things like this. </sentence><sentence id="230">Number three, there was a neighborhood congregation in Weisaminda(ph), which is near Bremerhaven(ph), that wanted some people to come and talk to them, so I went there sometimes and talked to them. </sentence><sentence id="231">Number four, we wanted to make a <span class="building">Jewish school</span> again because the children did not go to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="232">I can speak about this later. </sentence><sentence id="233">And, besides this, number five, they wanted a person from the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span> to be acontact _, going to the Gestapo maybe once, twice, or maybe three times a week and tell them about what was happening in the congregation, so I

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1934">Q: So it wasn't a matter of either more comfort there or less comfort with somebody who doesn't understand where you came from and what you went through. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1936">A: No, it came, it came automatically, you know, it happened this way, just to happen you see, it is true, you see, that both people try to marry someone who is from their own background or so, unless someone cannot find anyone at all here and I know people who are going to <span class="country">Iran</span>, or go to other place and marry there, but usually they try to find someone. </sentence><sentence id="1937">Also I liked her family and the family gave me some, something, yeah, helped. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1940">Q: Well I guess, you know when you had talked about initially coming over here and being surprised that most Americans were clueless about what was happening in <span class="country">Europe</span> and they didn't care and they didn't even want to know, it would seem to me that it might be logical that you'd want to spend your time with people who had your same sensibilities about this. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1952">A: Not the way in which the German government operated at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1953">Because in the 20's, when they wanted to establish a democracy in <span class="country">Germany</span>, _ a democracy, most people were not in favor of this democracy, or they didn't care and therefore, one government after the other fell. </sentence><sentence id="1954">That was one thing. </sentence><sentence id="1955">Number two was, the Treaty of Versailles, in 1918, 1919, did not intend to create a This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1956">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1957"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 8 United Nations, or what we have now, in the <span class="building">League of Nations</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1958">They did not want to, they did not want to bring people closer, but they wanted to separate people and they made different <span class="country">countries</span>, small <span class="country">countries</span>, which didn't exist before. </sentence><sentence id="1959">They made this a <span class="country">country</span>, this a <span class="country">country</span>, they made all different <span class="country">countries</span>, before it was all united. </sentence><sentence id="1960">And all this encouraged someone like Hitler to bring them together again and to tell the people, you see, don't worry about it, you are not treated well, the Versailles Treaty didn't treat you well and there's inflation and you can't get anything, no jobs, nothing. </sentence><sentence id="1961">I will bring the <span class="env feature">sun</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1962">But he could only do this by having a scapegoat and he took the Jews, because the Jews are very, very passive in this way. </sentence><sentence id="1963">So therefore, from this point of view, giving him the power, people gave him the power, so that Holocaust came about. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1998">A: It has to be honest. </sentence><sentence id="1999">The first thing that happened, what Hitler did, it was in education. </sentence><sentence id="2000">He changed the, all the pictures in the books of the <span class="building">kindergarten</span> and who knows what and put in the Jews with the big nose and with hook and this kind of thing and such a person you have to hate. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2001">You can put everything into a child's mind, a child doesn't know the difference between right and wrong. </sentence><sentence id="2002">They learned this only much later. </sentence><sentence id="2003">So therefore, if a child does not get the right information from the beginning, everything goes wrong. </sentence><sentence id="2004">And that's why this sof the ------__ and other things, taught them wrong. </sentence><sentence id="2005">Education is very important. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2006">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="2007">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="2008"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 9 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2009">Q: But what about our education as Jews? </sentence><sentence id="2010">To make us stand up a little bit quicker? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2011">A: What should they do? </sentence><sentence id="2012">The Jews education does not, does not emphasize war or things of this sort, or hate or, even the Christian religion you see, says love your neighbor like yourself. </sentence><sentence id="2013">And many religions teach, say this, but the difference is, we say and I don't know if I should say it, but we say, that's a way to act, not that's a way to think only. </sentence><sentence id="2014">Roosevelt said it. </sentence><sentence id="2015">Roosevelt knew only in mind, but not in action. </sentence><sentence id="2016">Same thing also with religion you see, to love your neighbor like yourself in your mind, yes, but in your action, not. </sentence><sentence id="2017">The action has to follow what you say in your mind, if not so, not so. </sentence><sentence id="2018">So that's what they have to teach the children here, to really act, to be together, to be friends with each other and so forth, to have more kind of realistic system, not just in your mind. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2035">A: There are certain, in certain <span class="region">areas</span> in which you should not be passive, but that I cannot say and make everyone responsible for, that is, there are certain laws, let's say the 10 Commandments, you see, they should be more active in those, not to kill, not to steal and so forth, you see, and just be more active in that, not only the Jews, everybody. </sentence><sentence id="2036">Because what's going on now with the <span class="dlf">drug scene</span>, with the killing and so forth, they don't believe it. </sentence><sentence id="2037">So, so there are certain, certain laws which, which every person should understand, logically. </sentence><sentence id="2038">And that they should teach them and not only teach them to think about this, I want to, I don't want to preach here, you see, you see. </sentence></p></dialogue>
