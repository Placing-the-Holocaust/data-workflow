<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3">A: My name's Robert Zimmer. </sentence><sentence id="4">I now live in <span class="populated place">Williamsburg</span>, <span class="region">Virginia</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7">Q: Where and when were you born? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9">A: I was born in <span class="populated place">Buffalo</span>, <span class="region">New York</span>, on the 28th of April 1924. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="11">Q: Could you tell us a little bit about what <span class="populated place">Buffalo</span> was like, your childhood was like in <span class="populated place">Buffalo</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="13">A: Well, I was part of the <span class="populated place">working class community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="14">My dad was a machinist on the <span class="dlf">Erie Railroad</span>, and we lived through the Depression, which was sort of harrowing at times, especially one Christmas Eve when my dad came <span class="building">home</span> and said he was laid off, and then that he was out of work about six months, and then he got back to work again; things improved from that point. </sentence><sentence id="15">So I was a Depression child. </sentence><sentence id="16">We didn't know we were poor. </sentence><sentence id="17">We -- I went to <span class="building">public school</span>, walked, oh, eight-tenths of a mile I guess. </sentence><sentence id="18">I was a kindergartner. </sentence><sentence id="19">And then went through <span class="building">high school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="20">Obviously, for my size, I played basketball, but it was a small <span class="building">high school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="21">There were only 44 of us in the graduating class. </sentence><sentence id="22">I married a girl from the graduating class, back then. </sentence><sentence id="23">I've known her since we were in <span class="building">kindergarten</span> I guess, and -- but we didn't date until going to the senior prom together. </sentence><sentence id="24">By that time <span class="populated place">Pearl Harbor</span> had happened, and everybody was going off to war or working in the <span class="building">war industries</span>. </sentence><sentence id="25">I decided I wanted to go to <span class="building">college</span>, although, I'd been the first one in our family to graduate from <span class="building">high school</span> even. </sentence><sentence id="26">My two older sisters, they are 10, 14 years older than I am, they left <span class="building">school</span> as sophomores to help support the family. </sentence><sentence id="27">And my folks said that I didn't have to support the family if I went to <span class="building">college</span>, and that was all the help they could give me for going away to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="28">I went to the <span class="building">state teacher's college</span> at <span class="populated place">Brockport</span>, <span class="region">New York</span>. </sentence><sentence id="29">I had enlisted in the -- enlisted Reserve Corp in July of "42, and was called to active duty then in April of "43. </sentence><sentence id="30">This enough background of growing up in <span class="populated place">Buffalo</span> or not? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="49">Q: No, that's fine. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="51">A: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="53">Q: In "42, after enlisting, can you tell us briefly what led up to your activity in <span class="country">Europe</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="55">A: Well, as I said, I'd enlisted in the Reserves, and they had permitted me to start <span class="building">college</span>. </sentence><sentence id="56">Then in April "43 I went on active duty, went through processing at <span class="populated place">Port Agra</span>, and then This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="57">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="58"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection ended up in basic training at <span class="building">Camp McQuaide</span> in the Coast Guard Artillery. </sentence><sentence id="59">I applied for a -- <span class="building">OCS</span>, the <span class="building">Boston candidate school</span> to get a commission. </sentence><sentence id="60">My battery commander recommended that we take our applications back and apply for an army specialized training program, <span class="building">ASTP</span>, which promised us 18 months of college training, and then <span class="building">officers candidate school</span> training. </sentence><sentence id="61">That sounded awfully good to me, and I said okay, and I went to <span class="building">Stanford University</span> for processing, and then to the <span class="building">University of Oregon</span> at <span class="populated place">Eugene</span>, <span class="region">Oregon</span>, to study engineering. </sentence><sentence id="62">This was the most intense academic work I had ever gone through. </sentence><sentence id="63">Tremendous number of courses that we had to take. </sentence><sentence id="64">We had supervised study every evening. </sentence><sentence id="65">We started at 6:00 o'clock in the morning, and had a schedule back then until 10:00 o'clock at night; and then lights were out at 10:30, so we didn't have much free time. </sentence><sentence id="66">Then in April of "43, this program closed down because of the anticipation of the invasion of <span class="country">Europe</span>, and these troops were really in a <span class="dlf">holding pattern</span>, we now realized, and we went to fill up the vacancies in the <span class="building">11th Armored Division</span>, and I became a -- well, I went to the <span class="building">22nd Tank Battalion Company</span>, AV, for <span class="spatial object">medium tanks</span>, and I was a bowl gunner, or a BOG, and an assistant driver on one of the <span class="spatial object">Sherman tank</span>, <span class="spatial object">medium tank</span>. </sentence><sentence id="67">And they gave us, oh, several review of basic training, taught us how to drive a <span class="spatial object">tank</span> and how to shoot a 75-millimeter gun from the <span class="spatial object">tank</span>, and while we're doing things, basic survival, but we got the division -- well, the division was getting ready to <span class="spatial object">ship</span> overseas then, in August, and we moved from <span class="region">California</span> -- <span class="populated place">Camp Cooke</span>, <span class="region">California</span> to the <span class="region">East Coast</span>, and I think that was <span class="populated place">Camp Kilmer</span>, <span class="region">New Jersey</span>, and went to board a <span class="spatial object">ship</span> one night, the <span class="spatial object">SS Samaria</span>, and half of the division was on it, about 5,000 men, and they congratulated us, that it was only single loaded. </sentence><sentence id="68">By that they meant that we didn't have to share our <span class="spatial object">bunks</span> with anybody. </sentence><sentence id="69">Because in double loaded you have one <span class="spatial object">bunk</span> for two people, and we were able to sleep for eight hours and the other guy would sleep for eight hours. </sentence><sentence id="70">But we had <span class="spatial object">bunks</span> by ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="71">And I shouldn't say <span class="spatial object">bunk</span>. </sentence><sentence id="72">It was actually -- they were <span class="spatial object">hammocks</span> that were strung across the <span class="interior space">dining room</span> <span class="spatial object">tables</span> and the <span class="spatial object">back table</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="73">It was a very, very quiet <span class="dlf">crossing</span>, but we had British food, and the British didn't make any friends among these American troops with the kind of food they gave us and the service we got. </sentence><sentence id="74">We were very unhappy with the Brits on this score. </sentence><sentence id="75">I don't know if any of the other guys told you about it, but we had close to food riots on the <span class="spatial object">ship</span>. </sentence><sentence id="76">We did see -- we were called to the general <span class="interior space">quarters</span> several times, and we did see some action of death charges being dropped. </sentence><sentence id="77">It was a large <span class="spatial object">convoy</span>, and-- so I presume that they had some alerts that there were <span class="spatial object">u-boats</span> stalking or trying to attack the <span class="spatial object">convoy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="78">We landed in <span class="populated place">Liverpool</span>, and much to our surprise saw the headlines of the newspaper saying the <span class="spatial object">SS Samaria</span> had been sunk, and we got off the <span class="spatial object">ship</span>, and we were glad the news headline wasn't true. </sentence><sentence id="79">Then they put us on <span class="spatial object">trains</span> and took us to the southern part of <span class="country">England</span> near <span class="populated place">Warminister</span> where we drew <span class="spatial object">tanks</span> and had to clean up the equipment, because these <span class="spatial object">tanks</span> had been stored, a lot of <span class="building">Cosmoline</span>, it's heavy grease on all parts. </sentence><sentence id="80">It's quite a chore cleaning it up and getting them in working condition. </sentence><sentence id="81">Then we had to check out the <span class="spatial object">tanks</span>, drive them enough to road test them and get a few miles on them so we were This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="82">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="83"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection confident that they weren't going to breakdown when we needed them. </sentence><sentence id="84">And then on about the 16th or 17th of December -- I'm skipping over. </sentence><sentence id="85">We had a few trips to <span class="populated place">London</span>, and I did get into <span class="populated place">London</span> in what they called a <span class="dlf">buzz bomb alley</span> where there was a lot of damage, and I was in <span class="populated place">London</span> one night, and when some buzz bombs came in, we could hear the explosions and see the flashes, and the anti-aircraft was going off. </sentence><sentence id="86">So having been in <span class="populated place">London</span> during some of the attacks, we were getting a poor taste of what the war was going to be like. </sentence><sentence id="87">On the 16th or 17th of December we moved to <span class="populated place">Wayland</span>, <span class="country">England</span>, and boarded an <span class="spatial object">LST</span>. </sentence><sentence id="88">It's a <span class="spatial object">landing ship tank</span> that were under the auspices of the U.S.Navy. </sentence><sentence id="89">And we really envied the navy guys because they had clean <span class="spatial object">beds</span> with sheets, <span class="interior space">showers</span>, and a good <span class="building">cafeteria</span>, good food, and a greatly enjoyed being guests of the Navy for that short cross of the <span class="dlf">channel</span>, which was just overnight. </sentence><sentence id="90">We landed in <span class="populated place">Sibret</span>, and then unloading the <span class="spatial object">tanks</span>, our <span class="spatial object">tank</span> had an accident. </sentence><sentence id="91">We were the number three <span class="spatial object">tank</span> being loaded, and so we're almost the last <span class="spatial object">tank</span> to unload. </sentence><sentence id="92">While the <span class="spatial object">LST</span> had a <span class="spatial object">basketball backboard</span> -- so when they didn't -- weren't carrying <span class="spatial object">tanks</span>, the crew could shoot baskets or something. </sentence><sentence id="93">Anyhow, our <span class="spatial object">tank</span> was under it, and the motion of unloading the <span class="spatial object">tanks</span>, the <span class="spatial object">backboard</span> had dropped loose, and it swung down. </sentence><sentence id="94">Well, our gunner reached up to move that so the <span class="dlf">hatch</span> of the <span class="spatial object">tank</span> wouldn't hit it. </sentence><sentence id="95">Our tank commander was down on the <span class="interior space">deck</span> directing our driver to get the <span class="spatial object">tank</span> off the <span class="spatial object">LST</span>. </sentence><sentence id="96">Well, just as our gunner, <span class="populated place">Edmonton</span> -- and most of these guys I refer to them by their last name -- had reached out to lift this up. </sentence><sentence id="97"><span class="populated place">Martiburg</span> [ph] gave Trevy [ph] the signal to move out, and he did, and <span class="populated place">Edmonton</span> caught his hand between this <span class="spatial object">backboard</span> and the <span class="spatial object">chariot top</span>. </sentence><sentence id="98">And he crushed two or three fingers, and part of his hand. </sentence><sentence id="99">Well, this was a real medical emergency, and nobody's around to help, so we bypass the <span class="spatial object">column</span>, and delivered <span class="populated place">Edmonton</span> to a <span class="building">hospital</span> by <span class="spatial object">tank</span>. </sentence><sentence id="100">We picked up a motorcycle escort and drove through <span class="populated place">Sibret</span>, and had -- the <span class="spatial object">motorcycle</span> MP didn't realize the <span class="spatial object">tank</span> could go that fast. </sentence><sentence id="101">We had <span class="dlf">steel tracks</span>, and this was December, so it was cold weather, and they were <span class="dlf">cobblestone streets</span> with <span class="dlf">streetcar tracks</span> on them, and we were skidding and swerving. </sentence><sentence id="102">In fact, we made about two turns where our <span class="spatial object">tank</span> went -- spint 360 degrees around before we changed directions. </sentence><sentence id="103">And, in fact, we almost ran over another <span class="spatial object">motorcycle</span>. </sentence><sentence id="104">The M-view was directing traffic, and he let the -- our escort come through, and he put up his hand for us to stop, and we weren't stopping, and he scrambled to get out of the way, and then we had two motorcycle escorts. </sentence><sentence id="105">Well, we got to this <span class="building">hospital</span>, and I had the distinction of being -- delivering the first patient ever by <span class="spatial object">tank</span> to this <span class="building">hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="106">And I actually carried <span class="populated place">Edmonton</span>. </sentence><sentence id="107">He was a small slight man, older than the rest of us, he was in our mid to late 30's, and we didn't see him until the war was over, and heard that he had lost two fingers and part of the palm of his hand. </sentence><sentence id="108">Then we got back to the company, and loaded up with gas and ammunition, because at this point we didn't know that there was a battle in the Bulge. </sentence><sentence id="109">We were originally scheduled to go to <span class="populated place">Calais</span> and help -- well, sort of contain about 10,000 Germans that had been bypassed, and this was sort of our introduction to combat. </sentence><sentence id="110">We weren't going to go in and capture them, but we weren't going to let them come out either. </sentence><sentence id="111">They had live This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="112">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="113"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection ammunition, we had live ammunition, we shot, we killed, but we were just going to make sure that they didn't move. </sentence><sentence id="114">That was the original plans that we had. </sentence><sentence id="115">Well, they changed that when the Battle of the Bulge started, and they gave orders to our division to travel from <span class="populated place">Sibret</span> directly to <span class="populated place">Bastogne</span>. </sentence><sentence id="116">This was a -- I'd say a force -- it was a force smart. </sentence><sentence id="117">We drove until we ran out of gas, and the <span class="spatial object">truck</span> came by, handed up a gas can, we loaded up and kept going. </sentence><sentence id="118">We drove through <span class="populated place">Paris</span> -- oh, this must have been about the 24th -- 23rd, 24th. </sentence><sentence id="119">I want to say it was the 24th of December, Christmas Eve. </sentence><sentence id="120">Now the people in <span class="populated place">Paris</span> knew about the Battle of the Bulge. </sentence><sentence id="121">They knew the German breakthrough, and we were being inundated with propaganda, that the Germans were going to be in <span class="populated place">Paris</span> by Christmas. </sentence><sentence id="122">Well, the <span class="building">American Armored Division</span> is a pretty impressive show of force to drive through the <span class="populated place">city</span>, and the people in <span class="populated place">Paris</span> were out on the <span class="dlf">sidewalks</span>, there were eight and ten <span class="dlf">gates</span>, they were trying to climb up on the <span class="spatial object">tanks</span> giving us eggs and flowers and fruit. </sentence><sentence id="123">Everything we wanted, but our orders were not to stop, very specific not to stop. </sentence><sentence id="124">I remember driving up to the <span class="spatial object">Arc of Triumph</span> and making a sharp left turn, and drove on through to <span class="populated place">Sanson</span>. </sentence><sentence id="125">And all the time it was just hurry, keep going, keep going. </sentence><sentence id="126">It's <span class="populated place">Sanson</span> they gave us a break to do some maintenance on the <span class="spatial object">tanks</span>, and I shouldn't use that word "break," because we had to work awfully hard. </sentence><sentence id="127">We had to break -- take the <span class="dlf">track</span> apart, and take the connectors that linked each section of <span class="dlf">track</span>. </sentence><sentence id="128">These come off as a big one-inch nut on it, and you have to take that apart, take that off, then with a sledgehammer knock the <span class="dlf">connector</span> off. </sentence><sentence id="129">And then we put on a new <span class="spatial object">connector</span> or an extender. </sentence><sentence id="130">We call them <span class="spatial object">duckbills</span>, which would extend the width of the <span class="dlf">track</span> about four to five inches. </sentence><sentence id="131">And, again, these have to be put on with a sledgehammer, and then the nuts put back on and tightened up, and it was not easy work; heavy physical work, as well as <span class="dlf">track</span> -- threading that <span class="dlf">track</span> up over the drive wheels and sprockets of the <span class="spatial object">tank</span>. </sentence><sentence id="132">They had promised us a turkey dinner for Christmas day, and they delivered it. </sentence><sentence id="133">We got turkey, but that was all we got, turkey and bread; no fixings, but we had turkey. </sentence><sentence id="134">Well, at this point they discovered that our <span class="spatial object">tank</span>, this is <span class="spatial object">tank A3</span>, had a bad transmission and so the rest of the division went on, and we stayed with ordinance while they repaired and eventually they replaced the transmission, and then they decided it was an engine problem; they replaced the <span class="spatial object">engine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="135">So the division went on to <span class="populated place">Neufchateau</span> and through <span class="populated place">Bastogne</span>, and got into action very quickly. </sentence><sentence id="136">Our <span class="spatial object">tank</span> was behind, so we missed the first day -- first several days of action. </sentence><sentence id="137">In fact, when we got up to <span class="populated place">Neufchateau</span>, they held us there until -- they thought the division was coming off the <span class="dlf">line</span>, and they didn't, so we were several days there. </sentence><sentence id="138">We didn't know where we were going to, just stayed put. </sentence><sentence id="139">I had some interesting stories as we were traveling by ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="140">I remember, this was now snow and ice, and I remember one little French boy, I would guess must have been seven or eight years old, about that high, came by the side of the <span class="dlf">road</span>. </sentence><sentence id="141">He looked cold and miserable. </sentence><sentence id="142">We stopped, and put some wool socks on him, and a hat, and gave him some candy bars, and muffled him up as best as we could, but we had to go, but he did look like a very forlorn waif by the side of the <span class="dlf">road</span>. </sentence><sentence id="143">Then as we were driving beyond here, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="144">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="145"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection now we're in <span class="country">France</span> into <span class="country">Belgium</span>, in that <span class="dlf">line</span> there, a <span class="dlf">one-lane road</span>, and it had sort of a crown on it to help drainage, but it was all ice and snow, and it was snowing. </sentence><sentence id="146">This was very tricky driving, because if we kept the <span class="spatial object">tank</span> balanced on the top of the crown, we made good progress. </sentence><sentence id="147">If it was off balance, we'd slide down to one side until we hit the <span class="dlf">ditch</span> and got some soft dirt, and then the <span class="dlf">tracks</span> would dig in and bring us up on top of the thing, but usually we'd go up too far and then we'd slide down the other side. </sentence><sentence id="148">So we were going down the <span class="dlf">road</span> like this, up one side, down the other. </sentence><sentence id="149">This was all right until we noticed that along both sides of the <span class="dlf">road</span> there were these large <span class="env feature">trees</span>, and they were, oh, at least that big around. </sentence><sentence id="150">These <span class="env feature">trees</span> were all notched, and they had little white <span class="spatial object">boxes</span> all wired around them. </sentence><sentence id="151">And we discovered later that these were boxes of TNT, and that was primer cord, and this whole <span class="dlf">road</span> had been mined like that in case the Germans did break through from <span class="populated place">Bastogne</span>. </sentence><sentence id="152">They would have blown all these <span class="env feature">trees</span>, and it would have been like jackstraws across that <span class="dlf">road</span>, and they would have been denied to the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="153">This concerned me driving down that <span class="dlf">road</span>. </sentence><sentence id="154">First of all, we didn't -- we could see probably blowing that <span class="dlf">road</span> while we were there. </sentence><sentence id="155">All we could see is bumping into something and setting the whole thing up. </sentence><sentence id="156">So that was a harrowing experience. </sentence><sentence id="157">Then we caught up with the division, and as I said, we waited, and then we were in the area around <span class="populated place">Longchamps</span> which is, oh, two or three kilometers from <span class="populated place">Bastogne</span>, in and around that <span class="region">area</span>, and we -- our company became part of CCR. </sentence><sentence id="158">The <span class="building">11th Armored Division</span> was divide -- made up of three <span class="building">combat commands</span>. </sentence><sentence id="159">Combat command CCA or <span class="building">CCB</span> or CCR. </sentence><sentence id="160">And there could be any combination of battalions or companies in either one depending on the mission. </sentence><sentence id="161">Well, the mission of <span class="building">Combat Command Ark</span>, CCR, was to support whichever -- A or B -- had the main action; in case of any difficulty, we'd back them up, in case they broke through, then we were to go through the break and exploit it. </sentence><sentence id="162">So we were always moving here and there depending on what the action was. </sentence><sentence id="163">Sometimes we'd move three or four times during a night, maybe -- frequently, more than that, almost like a chess game, to get in position where we expected the German thrust to be. </sentence><sentence id="164">And I remember painting our <span class="spatial object">tanks</span> white, or whitewashing them, so we could hardly see them with all that snow around, and it was very cold. </sentence><sentence id="165">Getting up in the morning, I'd take half three-quarters of an inch of gauze across the inside of the <span class="spatial object">tank</span>. </sentence><sentence id="166">There's no <span class="spatial object">heaters</span> in the <span class="spatial object">tank</span>, and we'd just be sitting there, and as long as one man was on the radio, the rest of us could sleep, so we'd take turns doing that, but it was cold. </sentence><sentence id="167">And sometimes we'd be in position. </sentence><sentence id="168">I remember one -- this little <span class="dlf">valley</span> where the forward slope of the <span class="env feature">valley</span>, and on the other side of the <span class="dlf">knoll</span> was our <span class="spatial object">German column</span>. </sentence><sentence id="169">This morning at dawn, bright and clear, blue <span class="env feature">sky</span>, it was beautiful, and our friends in the 19th ? </sentence><sentence id="170"><span class="populated place">Akal</span>? </sentence><sentence id="171"><span class="building">Air Command</span> came over with their <span class="spatial object">P-47s</span>, and attacked this <span class="spatial object">German column</span>. </sentence><sentence id="172">Now, the <span class="spatial object">column</span> was out of sight, it was on the other side of this <span class="dlf">hill</span>, but we could see the people dive down, we could see the machine guns going, we could see them drop bombs, and it actually disappeared around the crest of the <span class="dlf">hill</span>. </sentence><sentence id="173">And after, oh, a half hour or so we got orders to move, that we were no longer This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="332">A: Oh, the massacre of <span class="populated place">Normandy</span>, about 160 I think. </sentence><sentence id="333">These were American solders that had been captured by the Germans and they were machine gunned. </sentence><sentence id="334">So the 11" decided not to take any prisoners for a while. </sentence><sentence id="335">And, in fact, General Patton had come down to <span class="building">division headquarters</span>, which is quite a way downs by the chain of command, to give direct orders to our division and commander that we were to take prisoners, and -- but we established our reputation then, and, so, we didn't wear patches, so -- we didn't want to be captured by the Germans; they didn't like us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
