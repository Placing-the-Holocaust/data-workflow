<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="27">Q: Tell me about your childhood as you were growing up? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="29">A: Well I grew up...uh when I was born...I was born during the sec...1st World War, in 1915...the war was...the the <span class="region">front</span> was standing in our <span class="populated place">town</span> for about a year so Sov...the <span class="country">Czarist Russia</span> and Germans. </sentence><sentence id="30">That <span class="region">sector</span>, that section of the of the <span class="region">front</span>, it was manned by the Austrians and it so happened that Hungarians...the Austra-Hungarian empire so there were lots of Hungarians there too, and Germans. </sentence><sentence id="31">Uh when I was about five months old they evacuated us to the rear, the Germans did. </sentence><sentence id="32">The...at that time it was the Hungarian, the Austria-Hungarian army, and we were uh from 1915, beginning of 1916, we were about forty, fifty kilometers in the rear on this of the of the front. </sentence><sentence id="33">There uh in 1917 my brother was born and in 1918 when the war ended, we came back to our <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="34">Uh the <span class="populated place">town</span> was almost uh totally demolished and there was nothing to do there, so my father moved to the nearest <span class="populated place">town</span> which was called <span class="populated place">Povorsk</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="35">Uh the Polish government was just established. </sentence><sentence id="36"><span class="country">Poland</span> became independent in 1918 and my father knowing Polish got a job as the mana...office manager in the Polish uh <span class="populated place">county county seat</span>. </sentence><sentence id="37">That way he worked for a couple of years till the Poles started settling that that part of the <span class="country">country</span>, because there were no Poles, very few Poles there, and they got a lot of Polish-speaking Poles and my father was fired. </sentence><sentence id="38">Uh this was about 1920. </sentence><sentence id="39">At that time the new Soviet army occupied, advanced all the way to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="40">They went by us and uh it was a very difficult time because there was also many Ukrainian uh independence groups trying to establish an independent <span class="country">Ukraine</span>, and among them were many bands of anti-  Semitic uh armies. </sentence><sentence id="41">There was <span class="populated place">Batura</span> (ph), and there was Bela and there were many others and whoever went by uh the Jews were their victims. </sentence><sentence id="42">The pogroms there were...you know...uh but somehow we survived and in 1920 the Soviets were pushed backed from <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>...the the Poles call it to this day the miracle of the , and uh we became, <span class="country">Poland</span> became a normal so-called democratic country. </sentence><sentence id="43">It turned out afterwards it was not democratic for everybody but was semi-democratic, and we lived there until 1939. </sentence><sentence id="44">Uh in the beginning it was not as bad a <span class="country">country</span> as being built. </sentence><sentence id="45">Uh my father went into business. </sentence><sentence id="46">He was not a good businessman (laughter) (cough). </sentence><sentence id="47">He supplemented his income by doing some bookkeeping and writing petitions to the <span class="building">Polish courts</span> in Polish because the majority of the population were Ukrainians, of course, and Jews where we lived and they needed somebody to...there were a few Polish people that knew Polish, so he used to supplement his income by writing petitions to the to the <span class="building">courts</span> or any other Polish authorities. </sentence><sentence id="48">I grew up uh in this <span class="populated place">town</span> till about...when my father lost his job before that he he went...he became a teacher in the neighboring <span class="populated place">town</span> where I, we, where I was where I was born, and for several...for about a year or so I stayed. </sentence><sentence id="49">I was three years old and I already started learning something and my father was a stickler for for education. </sentence><sentence id="50">And uh I stayed there for a year or two. </sentence><sentence id="51">I missed my...it was only twelve kilometers away but it might have been (laughter) you know the the <span class="env feature">moon</span>. </sentence><sentence id="52">That's that's while, you know, didn't have any <span class="spatial object">cars</span> or we went by <span class="spatial object">train</span> which then you had to walk six kilometers or went by horse and <span class="spatial object">wagon</span>, so it was tough and I missed my family though my father was there. </sentence><sentence id="53">One day I remember my father went for , went <span class="building">home</span>, and he left me there and my...and and he took by horse and went to the nearest <span class="building">railroad station</span> which was about six kilometers away and I I was probably four or five years old and I ran after the realize it that he sneaked out I guess. </sentence><sentence id="54">He didn't want...it was expensive to go by <span class="spatial object">train</span>, see, but he didn't realize...to this day I remember it. </sentence><sentence id="55">I I resented it very much, and I ran after him into the <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="56">They had to go through a big <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="57">There were wolves in the <span class="env feature">forest</span> but he...I was yelling, you know, and and he he heard me and he turned back and he took me with him. ( </sentence><sentence id="58">Laughter) So I grew up in that <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="59">Then my father went to as I told you before, and he didn't do badly. </sentence><sentence id="60">It was...he had a uh <span class="building">military garrison</span>. </sentence><sentence id="61">The the the terrain around our <span class="populated place">town</span> was swampy and and lot lots of <span class="env feature">forests</span>, lots of <span class="env feature">woods</span> and it was used for training the Polish army, so we used to do business with the Polish army. </sentence><sentence id="62">Uh my father used to have a uh <span class="building">beer parlor</span> like, you know, which Poles used to come and drink. </sentence><sentence id="63">He also had a kind of a so-called <span class="building">department store-like</span> which was probably twelve by twelve (laughter), but it had everything and we used to make a living from the...the Ukrainian peasants used to come and buy from us. </sentence><sentence id="64">Uh later on it was very difficult because in 1936 I think, died, the leader of <span class="country">Poland</span> who established a semi-dictatorship and since then the life for Jews in <span class="country">Poland</span> was very tough. </sentence></p></dialogue>

id="402">Picked up that <span class="spatial object">spoon</span>. </sentence><sentence id="403">I had it for a long time, and when we crossed that <span class="env feature">swamp</span>, there was a

The minute we we we crossed, we swam over that <span class="env feature">river</span>, I decided to have a cigarette. </sentence><sentence id="409">Not food but a cigarette, smoke it, and I took a puff and at this.... I wouldn't be there, I probably would have stayed there, but he , and he survived. </sentence><sentence id="410">So we went to the <span class="populated place">village</span> and the <span

till the next morning. </sentence><sentence id="411">The next morning we went down and we saw thousands of Russian soldiers, without without officers, without...not organized units. </sentence><sentence id="412">All, every everybody and quickly there were a few officers and we decided that if we encountered some Germans, we'll fight. </sentence><sentence id="413">We had we had a

small group of Germans. </sentence><sentence id="415">If not we will scatter and hid and there were again these tall uh ... can't remember the name of that uh place and uh and sure enough when we were talking organizing there's one <span class="spatial object">truck</span> with Germans, German soldiers, that they...machine guns on it, and they're already leading a procession of prisoners of war and they motioned to us to come to surrender and the majority did. </sentence><sentence id="416">The majority surrendered. </sentence><sentence id="417">We, being Jewish, knew that this means certain

circled that because they didn't drive into the __. </sentence><sentence id="419">They were afraid to drive in the <span class="dlf">field</span>, but they circled it and whoever got up...and there were a lot of us still hidden...whoever got up and surrendered, they shot. </sentence><sentence id="420">They didn't take any more prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="421">We did not . </sentence><sentence id="422">They circled it and left, left the place. </sentence><sentence id="423">We got out and then we found a few more Russian...Soviet officers and we joined them and we were a welcomed addition to their group because by knowing Yiddish...I speak a little German too and I understand German quite well...uh they, they used to send us out uh scouting whenever we came to a <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="424">So we traveled for about six weeks...the real uh German forces...uh at night we would sleep somewhere _. </sentence><sentence id="425">Of course first we had to find out if they are friendly or unfriendly Ukrainians. </sentence><sentence id="426">They, they knew, these officers knew where _ and uh at night, at night we we walked. </sentence><sentence id="427">In the daytime we would stay in the <span class="populated place">villages</span>. </sentence><sentence id="428">One uh...in every <span class="populated place">village</span> we approached they used to send us to find out if German . </sentence><sentence id="429">One night we came to a little <span class="populated place">village</span> and we came to...at the <span class="region">outskirts</span> of the <span class="populated place">village</span> there was a <span class="building">house</span> and we knocked on the <span

Germans already. </sentence><sentence id="433">This...where's their guard. </sentence><sentence id="434">He is sitting there over this <span class="spatial object">rifle</span> asleep. </sentence><sentence id="435">So of course we could have uh thrown a grenade in there and killed them all, but we didn't. </sentence><sentence id="436">The family would have been killed, and besides the whole <span class="populated place">village</span> was full of Germans. </sentence><sentence id="437">They would (laughter) capture us in no time. </sentence><sentence id="438">So we slowly retreated and stayed in the <span class="env feature">forest</span> till we went all around and came to the next <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="439">And we were like this we traveled for about I suppose about six weeks, till the one point we crossed a a point where the uh <span class="populated place">town</span> where the that changed hands several times the last few days, and we crossed a little <span class="env feature">river</span> there and we came out and this was...I still remember...I I remember the date because it was uh the Russian revolution

Germans never crossed them. </sentence><sentence id="447">They went all around. </sentence><sentence id="448">Was a waste of time. </sentence><sentence id="449">Uh with very little food. </sentence><sentence id="450">We stayed in peasants" <span class="building">houses</span> worked together all the time. </sentence><sentence id="451">We stayed there for a few months till spring and in the spring they took us to another <span class="populated place">town</span> and there they were building a <span class="dlf">railroad</span> between...uh started between...on the other side of the
