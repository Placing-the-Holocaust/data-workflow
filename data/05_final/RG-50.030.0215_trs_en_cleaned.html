</sentence><sentence id="121">Later on the majority thought that this  interested too much in it. </sentence><sentence id="122">I don't know why and I couldn't get established so I went to <span class="populated place">Lodz</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="123"><span class="populated place">Lodz</span> was the <span class="populated place">industrial capital</span> of <span

these things. </sentence><sentence id="136">Of course he improved on it using German technology and German, you know, ___ but originally it was tough. </sentence><sentence id="137">And in one night they re-settled hundreds of families in our <span class="region">region</span>, <span class="country">Poles</span>, and sent them to <span class="country">Siberia</span>. </sentence><sentence

</sentence><sentence id="443">And other <span class="populated place">towns</span>, here and there somebody will escape and you know, word gets around, so a group of young people decided to leave the <span class="populated place">town</span> and to go into the <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="444">They knew that something will happen. </sentence><sentence id="445">So they made some make-shift arms...uh <span class="spatial object">board</span> uh which uh spring that would fire a bullet if you could find one. </sentence><sentence id="446">Probably

peasants, got some food and organized a partisan group to fight the Germans, with what, how I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="459">Uh a little bit later some escaped Soviet prisoners of war joined them and a lot of...all the people came. </sentence><sentence id="460">It was a <span class="populated place">civilian camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="461">And some of them uh craftsmen,

accumulated some <span class="spatial object">stores</span> of food and they were ready to do some damage to the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="464">The uh this <span class="region">territory</span> where we lived had some unexploded artillery shells from the 1st World War yet, and the young kids, twelve, fourteen years old...some of them survived ..used to take out the explosives from there, put in a detonator and make a mine to put under the <span class="dlf">railroad lines</span> where the Germans shipped, you know, war supplies and and troops to the front, but it was way back already behind the <span class="dlf">German lines</span>, so they used to uh...they got in touch with Soviet, you know, Soviet army. </sentence><sentence id="465">They dropped by <span class="spatial object">parachute</span> more arms and they were uh really an effective fighting force. </sentence><sentence id="466">Uh my old...my younger brother...I was the

sure enough within a short time they were attacked, but before before...but they really were attacked they decided to move the <span class="populated place">camp</span> deeper into the <span

and didn't want to abandon it, so they left some guards to guard it and among them was my brother. </sentence><sentence id="470">Uh so when they came with this force attacked...the force consisted of Germans, lots of troops...Russian, the Ukrainian police, my brother was standing guard and when he saw it was too late already . </sentence><sentence id="471">To do anything he shot in the <span
