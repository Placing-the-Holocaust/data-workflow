<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3">A: My name is Leon Chameides, originally pronounced Humeidis and we're now sitting at 65 <span class="dlf">Westbridge Drive</span>, in <span class="populated place">West Hartford</span>, <span class="region">Connecticut</span>, my current <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4">I was born in <span class="populated place">Cutuvitsa</span>, <span class="country">Poland</span> in south -- <span class="region">southern Poland</span>, in 1935. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7">Q: Okay, now, Dr. Chameides, | -- I'd like to start a little bit -- just before the period that we -- we were planning to begin. </sentence><sentence id="8">Just at those -- those last days that you recall before liberation. </sentence><sentence id="9">Did you have an anticipation that something was -- was going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="10">What -- Do you recall what your feelings were at thas -- that time just before -- just before liberation? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="15">A: I think, first of all, I have to emphasize the fact that in 1944, I was nine years old. </sentence><sentence id="16">And I had been away from <span class="building">home</span> for a little over two years, since August of 1942. </sentence><sentence id="17">And if you remember your feelings at nine years of age, it's very difficult to separate out, and to recall exactly what one's feelings were at that time and what occurred later and I'm very - - always very careful not to read in things that occurred later and attribute them to that time. </sentence><sentence id="18">I was in a small <span class="populated place">village</span> by the name of <span class="building">Univ</span>, which is near the large <span class="populated place">city</span> of <span class="populated place">Lvov</span>, now in the <span class="country">Ukraine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="19"><span class="building">Univ</span> was very close to the <span class="populated place">extermination camp</span> of <span class="populated place">Belzyce</span>. </sentence><sentence id="20">But I was hidden in a <span class="building">monastery</span>, the <span class="building">Univ monastery</span> was the <span class="building">mother monastery</span> of the stunite This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="21">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="22"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0029 3 monks of the <span class="building">Ukrainian Catholic Church</span>. </sentence><sentence id="23">I was, by that time, a Greek Catholic in my -- in my approach really, but with fairly vivid feelings and recollections of being Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="24">And we, of course, knew that things were happening, because the front was coming closer and closer to us. </sentence><sentence id="25">There were the tremendous amount of warfare. </sentence><sentence id="26">The Ukrainian partisans were fighting on the <span class="region">German side</span> and then saw that <span class="country">Germany</span> was going to lose and there was a lot of confusion. </sentence><sentence id="27">So a lot of the <span class="populated place">village</span> people were involved in the fighting, and the fighting -- the front came close and closer to us. </sentence><sentence id="28">We could hear it, we could see it's effects. </sentence><sentence id="29">I'm not sure that I had any feeling in terms of that I was going to be liberated. </sentence><sentence id="30">It was -- There was a certain amount of excitement in the -- in a war coming, but of course we had been through this so many times before, that the issue then was primarily how to survive and how to get the next meal. </sentence><sentence id="31">I think those were much more of immediate concern to us -- or to me, at least, than anything else. </sentence><sentence id="32">For reasons I'm not clear, we had one healer, I don't know whether he was a physician or not, but one person who knew something about medicine in the <span class="region">area</span>, that I managed to become his helper at the ripe age of nine and we set up a -- a <span class="building">hospital</span> in the <span class="building">church</span> and we brought in -- the wounded were brought in from the -- and one of my jobs -- course, we had no medicines at all, and one of my jobs was after the battles, to run into the <span class="env feature">forest</span> and to rummage around, find dead soldiers, particularly if they were German, because they would usually have bandages and first aid material on them, and get as much of that material as possible. </sentence><sentence id="33">If they were bandaged -- their wounds were bandaged, I would take the wou -- bandages off and then run back and wash them, so we could use them on the -- on the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="34">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="35"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0029 4 Ukrainians. </sentence><sentence id="36">This helped me a great deal. </sentence><sentence id="37">It taught me a lot and also, it -- it helped me because on Sundays, the farmers, the families would come and then -- and they would -- to see their husbands and youngsters and -- and I would always be around and so I would get eggs and cheese and milk and so there was food. </sentence><sentence id="38">So, we knew something was coming, the <span class="dlf">front</span> was coming closer to us, the bombardments were more common. </sentence><sentence id="39">One heard a lot of shooting a-around and so we knew something big was -- was about to happen. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="67">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence><sentence id="68">And then, a-a-appreciating the fact that you were nine and that you're not going -- going to recall, of course, all the details or even, you know, looking back at -- those number of years to exactly what you were feeling at the time, and appreciating that fact that you don't want to reconstruct something, as you just said, what do you recall about those actual first moments of realizing that something was really changing now? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="71">A: Well, unfortunately for us, again, in my position, not that much changed, because when the Russians entered, I was on the wrong side, because almost as soon as the Russians entered, which as I recall was in June of 1944, Stalin, as you recall, was a firm opponent of the <span class="building">Greek Catholic Church</span>. </sentence><sentence id="72">The <span class="building">Greek Catholic Church</span> was a <span class="building">nationalist church</span>, it was very much bound up with Ukrainian nationalism and with a drive for independence on the part of the <span class="country">Ukraine</span>, from the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span>. </sentence><sentence id="73">And so Stalin, who eventually outlawed the <span class="building">Greek Catholic Church</span>, imme -- almost immediately began persecuting the priests. </sentence><sentence id="74">And so, we would see now, instead of Jews being shot, we would see priests being shot. </sentence><sentence id="75">And so, one day, I had heard that there was a -- a horse drawn This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="76">It is not the

place">Lvov</span> and I felt that I had to get out of <span class="building">Univ</span> and so I took one of the younger boys, who is now in <span class="country">Israel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="78">His name now is Oded Amarand, but at that time, his name was Dodo, and we decided we would walk to this nearby <span class="populated place">village</span> -- I have no i-idea of how much of a distance that was, in order to try to get this <span class="spatial object">wagon</span>, and on the way, we were stopped by <span class="country">Russian</span> soldiers a-and a Russian patrol stopped us. </sentence><sentence id="79">And children were very often used as spies, so we were highly suspect. </sentence><sentence id="80">And I remember sitting in, behind a <span class="env feature">bush</span>, crouched with my arms up in the air as this Russian was standing in front of us, not knowing -- with a tommy gun -- not knowing what to do. </sentence><sentence id="81">And finally, after what seemed like an eternity, I talked them into allowing us to go to a <span class="building">farmhouse</span> and -- which he did, and eventually he let us go back to <span class="building">Univ.</span> </sentence><sentence id="82">A- And then, it was I think several weeks before another horse drawn <span class="spatial object">carriage</span> was going -- this time I think from <span class="building">Univ</span>, if I recall correctly, and to <span class="populated place">Lvov</span>, which is a ridiculously small distance when covered by <span class="spatial object">car</span>, but is incredibly lengthy by horse-drawn <span class="spatial object">carriage</span>. </sentence><sentence id="83">And I was able to get on that and went to <span class="populated place">Lvov</span>, to the mother <span class="building">church</span>, <span class="building">Santa Yura</span> -- which is the Ukrainian for Saint George, in <span class="populated place">Lvov</span>. </sentence><sentence id="84">And it was in <span class="populated place">Santa Yura</span>, and I don't know how long I was there at this time, I don't get the impression it was a long time, but I really don't have a good concept of time, it could have been weeks, or might have been months, I'm not sure. </sentence><sentence id="85">But i-it was during the morning mass that I remember, which was celebrated by Brat Yosef, Brother Joseph was his name, I remember the way he looked, a bald head with a white beard. </sentence><sentence id="86">And he was celebrating the mass and in the middle of the mass, in walked two boys who were dressed differently than I was. </sentence><sentence id="87">But the dress and This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

in pants made of burlap, because we had nothing, and shoes made of -- of wood, soles made of wood, because there was no leather. </sentence><sentence id="91">And here come these two boys, who are already better dressed. </sentence><sentence id="92">They're in short pants, in a western style, better material. </sentence><sentence id="93">And that was -- one of the boys was my brother and the other one was a young man who is now a chemist in <span class="populated place">San Francisco</span>. </sentence><sentence id="94">And they motioned to me and -- and I went with them and I remember going to have something to eat first, because we didn't eat before mass and so we had something to eat and -- and they took me out of the <span class="building">monastery</span>. </sentence><sentence id="95">So -- So that's how I got out of the <span class="building">monastery</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="125">Q: When did you realize that that was your brother? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="127">A: | -- I think -- I think I realized almost immediately, but I wasn't a hundred percent certain. </sentence><sentence id="128">I hadn't seen him in a -- two and a half years and at that age, there's a big change that occurs in -- in people. </sentence><sentence id="129">But I -- I think I realized almost immediately that it was. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="130">Cause I had thought about him a great deal while I was in hiding and the -- the Studite monks made a tremendous effort to always keep us separated, because they were afraid that if we were ever together, we would not only give each other away, but they were in mortal danger themselves, because they were really -- would -- would have been killed had it been known they were hiding Jews. </sentence><sentence id="131">So -- And I remember once, I was in <span class="building">Univ</span>, in the <span class="interior space">attic</span>. </sentence><sentence id="132">I found a pair of pants that I was absolutely certain were his and that were hidden there, but I'm -- I'm not sure the -- </sentence></p><p><sentence id="133"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="134">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="135"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="136"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0029 7 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="137">Q: Do you recall when you finally realized and when you did, you know, connect with him? </sentence><sentence id="138">Do you -- Do you -- Do you remember? </sentence><sentence id="139">Was it -- Was it sa -- Was there enough tension so that the -- the reunion wasn't particularly joyful at the -- at that moment or d- do you recall? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="140">A: You know, I don't, and I honestly don't remember emotions very well and -- and again, you know, we had been through so many eventful days and so many eventful months and years, that it seemed like I was almost numb and that nothing surprised me, so here it is. </sentence><sentence id="141">I mean, I -- I don't -- unless I don't remember correctly, which is also possible, but I do not recall a particularly strong emotion. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="144">Q: That makes me wonder whether, I mean, especially with children and you see children nowadays in <span class="country">Bosnia</span>, for example, whether they -- di-di-did you have an idea that this was not normal, what you were going through, or did you just think this is what hap -- not that you would have consciously thought, but did -- do you recall if you would have thought, "This is not normal, this is not supposed to be happening?" </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="145">A: 1 -- I don't think I had -- I don't think I had sophisticated thoughts of that nature. </sentence><sentence id="146">I -- I think clearly, you know, at -- at least at the very beginning, I missed my parents tremendously. </sentence><sentence id="147">I was terribly scared a good portion of the time. </sentence><sentence id="148">But -- But the immediate things were hunger, were -- were loneliness, were trying to make sure that one didn't give oneself away by either saying one was Jewish -- we were particularly marked because it - - we were in a society where only Jews were circumcised, so I was always -- I had to be very, very careful, never go -- to go to the <span class="interior space">bathroom</span> when other boys were there, never to </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="165">Q: So, what you're describing, in terms of -- whereas for some people in -- in other <span class="region">parts of Europe</span>, there -- there was a liberation, there was a sense that, you know, this chapter is over. </sentence><sentence id="166">But in -- What you're describing is -- is at least up -- up through parts of 1946, exchanged one oppressor for another, such -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="167">A: Well, not through "46, because this was -- we did not stay under the Russians til "46, so -- so th -- what I'm describing now, is the immediate liberation by the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="168">And again, you know, I think every person, of course, is different and -- and adapts differently, but also, I think the age makes a big difference. </sentence><sentence id="169">I notice, for instance, people who were just a few years older than I, had different reactions than I did, because they -- I think you develop a sense of perspective and -- and -- and knowledge of the world, which, I think at the age of seven, or even nine, y-you just don't have. </sentence><sentence id="170">So, y-you have a different, you know -- you may develop the skills for survival and the skills for turning </sentence></p></dialogue>
