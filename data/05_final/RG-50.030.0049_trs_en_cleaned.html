But we worked to this kind of <span class="building">fortification</span> all the period of time. </sentence><sentence id="124">And the summer of, uh, 1940, it was a Russian ultimatum asking Romanian to cede the <span class="populated place">Bessarabia</span> [and], uh, <span class="region">northern part</span> of <span class="populated place">Bukovina</span>. </sentence><sentence id="125">I was, uh, near...uh, two or three kilometer fr...from, uh, uh, small <span class="populated place">city</span>--the name is <span class="populated place">Her_a</span>--which, uh, which never was, uh, in the occupied by the Russian. </sentence><sentence id="126">But it was in the <span class="region">Moldavian part</span>. </sentence><sentence id="127">And the Russians, they were interested to have, uh, <span class="dlf">bridge</span> in[to], uh, uh, <span class="country">Romania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="128">So they took...they took this <span class="populated place">city</span> of <span class="populated place">Her_a</span>, too. </sentence><sentence id="129">And, uh...and after then, we retreat. </sentence><sentence id="130">It was, uh...I retreat from, uh... with the whole army, the Romanian army, from this point "til Roman--the <span class="populated place">city</span> Roman. </sentence><sentence id="131">Day and night, day and night; uh, because it was... We were under very big pressure, because behind us it was the  Romanian army from <span class="populated place">Bessarabia</span> [and] from <span class="populated place">Bukovina</span>, who has to escape. </sentence><sentence id="132">And, uh, after then, being in Roman--as a matter of fact, in a <span class="populated place">village</span> near Roman--I, uh...I being Jewish, and, uh, with other people...and other soldier being Jewish, we were expelled from the <span class="building">Amny</span>." </sentence><sentence id="133">And I remember, because I was on act...on active duty. </sentence><sentence id="134">I didn't have even civilian clothes with me. </sentence><sentence id="135">So they give me some kind of clothes from the...from their <span class="building">warehouse</span>, which didn't fit on me. </sentence><sentence id="136">Which was...I was almost naked. </sentence><sentence id="137">And I receive orders to present myself to the to the regiment in <span class="populated place">Rimnicu S_rat</span>. </sentence><sentence id="138">And it was...it was a problem to, uh, to take the <span class="spatial object">train</span> and to make the journey to... to, uh, <span class="populated place">Rimnicu</span> S rat, because everybody, it was military. </sentence><sentence id="139">And who was was dressed like me, know...know...they know exactly that...that I...I was a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="140">So it was...it was very dangerous to make this trip to, to <span class="populated place">Rimnicu</span> S_rat; because uh, well, I...I could be beaten or just threw out...threw out of ...of the <span class="dlf">window</span>--which that happened to many people. </sentence><sentence id="141">So I managed to escape. </sentence><sentence id="142">And, uh, I present the second day I was to the regiment. </sentence><sentence id="143">And they give me...they give me a order to go <span class="building">home</span>, and to wait for new...new...new disposition. </sentence><sentence id="144">I arrived <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="145">And after three days or four days, I receive an order to come back to the <span class="building">regiment</span> on September Ist, 1940. </sentence><sentence id="146">I come back. </sentence><sentence id="147">And I was...I, I was sent to, uh, in the <span class="building">working battalions</span>. </sentence><sentence id="148">It was not yet in the <span class="populated place">labor camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="149">All the former soldiers, they have to go to the work...to the <span class="building">fortification</span>. </sentence><sentence id="150">And I was sent to the <span class="env feature">Carpathian Mountains</span> and, uh, the <span class="populated place">city</span>...the small <span class="populated place">city</span> <span class="populated place">Tirgu Neam_</span>, working the <span class="dlf">fortification</span> facing the <span class="dlf">Hungarian border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="151">That's...this was the period of time when the br...the war broke. </sentence><sentence id="152">And, uh, when in the summer of 1941 I was <span class="building">home</span>, sent back from the working battalions. </sentence><sentence id="153">And I worked in the <span class="populated place">city</span> [of <span class="populated place">Hu_i</span>], sent doing kind of cleaning the <span class="dlf">streets</span> and something like this. </sentence><sentence id="154">Not...not too hard. </sentence><sentence id="155">It was very humiliating, because everybody knows us. </sentence><sentence id="156">But we didn't have another choice. </sentence><sentence id="157">I remember that the war broke against the Russians on June 22nd [1941]. </sentence><sentence id="158">It was Sunday. </sentence><sentence id="159">Saturday, in the afternoon, all Jewish male from, uh, the age of eighteen to sixty, we have to present ourselves to the <span class="building">police quarter</span>. </sentence><sentence id="160">I didn't know why. </sentence><sentence id="161">So I was there; and there we were locked up. </sentence><sentence id="162">Nobody can leave. </sentence><sentence id="163">We left...we slept in the <span class="interior space">courtyard</span> of the <span class="building">police quarter</span> in <span class="populated place">Hu_i</span>. </sentence><sentence id="164">And in the dawn, we're sent to an unknown destination. </sentence><sentence id="165">What was known, it was that I heard going to the <span class="populated place">villages</span> that the war broke. </sentence><sentence id="166">And we heard the orders that everybody has to go to war against the...the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="167">As...an interesting story which I remember, that we arrived in a small <span class="populated place">village</span> in a nearby <span class="region">county</span> near, <span class="populated place">Tutova</span>, is the name of this <span class="region">county</span>. </sentence><sentence id="168">And the <span class="populated place">village</span>, the name is <span class="populated place">Bogdana</span>. </sentence><sentence id="169">I can't forget it. </sentence><sentence id="170">And we stood there for one night waiting for some orders. </sentence><sentence id="171">I don't know what kind of order we expected. </sentence><sentence id="172">But I remember, that it was in afternoon of this same day that, uh, an officer from the <span class="building">gendarmerie</span> came to us. </sentence><sentence id="173">And we know very well who the gend...the...the...the <span class="building">gendarmerie</span> is. </sentence><sentence id="174">They were the most  oppressive part of the Romanian Army. </sentence><sentence id="175">But I have to tell you that this man, it was a very kind man. </sentence><sentence id="176">And he told us, "Don't be afraid, as long as you are under my <span class="region">jurisdiction</span>. </sentence><sentence id="177">If I...if I have to go to eat, I'll never eat if I know that you are hungry...uh, hungry." </sentence><sentence id="178">His name is [Gheorghe] Pris caru. </sentence><sentence id="179">And I remember that after the war, I wrote about this man, in September 1944. </sentence><sentence id="180">But from...from <span class="populated place">Bogdana</span>, it comes the order to go to a <span class="populated place">city</span> of Birlad.(Cough) Iam sorry. </sentence><sentence id="181">And now, in the Birlad, we are...we embarked on the <span class="spatial object">train</span>, the <span class="spatial object">cattle train</span>, and sent to a camp--<span class="populated place">deportation camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="182">And the <span class="populated place">city</span>, it was <span class="populated place">Tirgu Jiu</span>. </sentence><sentence id="183">And we arrived in <span class="populated place">Tirgu Jiu</span> after a journey of two or three days. </sentence><sentence id="184">But on this our journey to <span class="populated place">Tirgu Jiu</span>, I want to tell you something which I like to be made...made...make it public. </sentence><sentence id="185">We stopped in a <span class="populated place">city</span>--the name is <span class="populated place">Craiova</span>--to change the <span class="spatial object">engine</span> to go to <span class="populated place">Tirgu Jiu</span>. </sentence><sentence id="186">It was in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="187">The soldier opened the <span class="dlf">doors</span> from the <span class="spatial object">cattle cars</span>. </sentence><sentence id="188">And some of us stepped out, just to take a breathe of fresh air. </sentence><sentence id="189">And a petty man from the... working, uh...a worker from the...from the <span class="dlf">railroad</span>, come to these people and...and start to mug them, taking their money and things which they have. </sentence><sentence id="190">An <span class="spatial object">engine</span> makes a maneuver, and ...and the neighbor from the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="191">And the <span class="spatial object">mech</span>...the mechanic from the <span class="spatial object">engine</span> saw this man mugging people. </sentence><sentence id="192">He stopped the <span class="spatial object">engine</span>, stepped down; and he went to this guy who who continued to do it, to mug. </sentence><sentence id="193">He slapped him in the face. </sentence><sentence id="194">He said, "Give back everything!" </sentence><sentence id="195">The guy, uh...the...the guy, he was afraid of [the mechanic], and he gave everything [back]. </sentence><sentence id="196">This man stepped up on the <span class="spatial object">engine</span>, started the <span class="spatial object">engine</span>, and he'll go continue his work. </sentence><sentence id="197">I don't know his name. </sentence><sentence id="198">I never saw him in my life. </sentence><sentence id="199">But I feel that I have to tell this story. </sentence><sentence id="200">In the beginning on the war, when in <span class="populated place">Ia_i</span> the Jews start to be killed by the Romani...the same people. </sentence><sentence id="201">We arrived in the camp of <span class="populated place">Tirgu Jiu</span>. </sentence><sentence id="202">It was something unbelievable huge. </sentence><sentence id="203">I want to tell you that this <span class="populated place">camp</span> of <span class="populated place">Tirgu Jiu</span> was built by the Polish army. </sentence><sentence id="204">When Polish was destroyed and occupied by the Russian, a part of the Polish Army was evacuated in <span class="country">Romania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="205">So this...this <span class="populated place">camp</span> was built by the Polish Army. </sentence><sentence id="206">Now in this period of time, the Polish Army left <span class="country">Romania</span>--this is another story. </sentence><sentence id="207">So it [NB: <span class="populated place">Tirgu Jiu</span>] was a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="208">It was the first <span class="populated place">concentration [camp]</span>, beside other: <span class="populated place">Caracal</span>, and <span class="populated place">Lugoj</span>, and <span class="populated place">Miercurea-Ciuc</span>, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="209">But this was the biggest of all of them. </sentence><sentence id="210">And, uh, this <span class="populated place">camp</span>, it was a very interesting mixture of people. </sentence><sentence id="211">It...it was divided in four and seven classes...uh, seven departments. </sentence><sentence id="212">And this department one or two, it was ...it was some opposition of the Antonescus--and, uh, generals and, uh, diplomats, which they paid to stay there. </sentence><sentence id="213">And the third class, it was a <span class="building">Legionary</span>--the fascists. </sentence><sentence id="214">I'll tell you that, entering in this...in this <span class="populated place">camp</span>, I said to myself, "Hey. </sentence><sentence id="215">At least, here I'll be, uh, nobody's yelling to me. </sentence><sentence id="216">No...no ...no...no...no...nobody will call me dirty names, and so on." </sentence><sentence id="217">Walking in front of this, uh, [third] department of the <span class="populated place">labor camp</span>, which we didn't know who they are--these people, they start to yell to us and curs...cursing us. </sentence><sentence id="218">I said, "Here, too?!" </sentence><sentence id="219">Where there are the Legionnaires. </sentence><sentence id="220">And department four, there were womans. </sentence><sentence id="221">The <span class="building">department five</span>, it was the  evacuees. </sentence><sentence id="222">We stood [NB: stayed] in the <span class="building">evacuees department</span>. </sentence><sentence id="223">It was the <span class="building">department number six</span>, it was the suspects of communists. </sentence><sentence id="224">And number seven, these were the communists. </sentence><sentence id="225">There are separate <span class="interior space">quarters</span>, but we managed to communicate with each other. </sentence><sentence id="226">Of course, not with the Legionnaires! </sentence><sentence id="227">Uh, after a short period of time, uh, part of us they sent to work in the <span class="interior space">garden</span>...in the gardening. </sentence><sentence id="228">And another part, there are sent the place...it was, uh, <span class="populated place">Valea</span> or <span class="populated place">Valea Jiului</span>, which was, where it was a famous lieutenant commander-- Trepadu_--which was the criminal, and after the war he was judged as a criminal. </sentence><sentence id="229">Uh, we stood [NB: stayed] in...in the camp of <span class="populated place">Tirgu Jiu</span> with a period of time, uh, four months, almost four months, when we are sent back in <span class="populated place">Hu_i</span>. </sentence><sentence id="230">And we are put in, uh, a <span class="populated place">local camp</span>, into the <span class="interior space">courtyard</span> of the <span class="building">Jewish community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="231">We are obliged to wear the yellow badge. </sentence><sentence id="232">And we are from time to time allowed to go <span class="building">home</span> and to change our underwear. </sentence><sentence id="233">Talking about this, I want to repeat another story about this, what happens. </sentence><sentence id="234">When I received my first, uh, "approval," how to say, to go <span class="building">home</span> to change my, my, uh, underwear, it was in <span class="populated place">Hu_i</span>. </sentence><sentence id="235">Uh, I remember that it was way to go to...to my hou...my parents" <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="236">And I know [one is] quite, uh...not a very, uh...not a center of the <span class="dlf">street</span>; but I said, "No, I have to go through the center of the <span class="dlf">street</span>." </sentence><sentence id="237">I'm wear the badge, so I ...I didn't care. </sentence><sentence id="238">I want to go see people, and people to see me; because everybody knows me there. </sentence><sentence id="239">And I remember that walking on the <span class="dlf">street</span>, I saw a girl which it was a very good friend of my young years. </sentence><sentence id="240">And she saw me, too. </sentence><sentence id="241">But she saw...seeing me coming with the yellow badge, she crossed the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="242">She didn't want to talk to me. </sentence><sentence id="243">And I walked farther. </sentence><sentence id="244">And it was in the center of the <span class="dlf">street</span>; people usually walked in the center, they stood [NB: stayed], they talk to them. </sentence><sentence id="245">And a friend of mine, uh, which are very close, he was a...a Romanian. </sentence><sentence id="246">And he saw me. </sentence><sentence id="247">And in front of all the people, he came to me and he hugged me. </sentence><sentence id="248">It was just a rebellion, to hug a Jew with a...with...with a yellow badge. </sentence><sentence id="249">And I want to say this, and to be--how to say?--forever. </sentence><sentence id="250">Because I can't forget this. </sentence><sentence id="251">Unfortunately, he died after the war. </sentence><sentence id="252">He was...he has tuberculosis. </sentence><sentence id="253">But doesn't matter. </sentence><sentence id="254">I want to talk about my friend. </sentence><sentence id="255">Uh, in this period of time being in <span class="populated place">camp</span> in <span class="populated place">Tirgu Jiu</span>, it happened something with my father which it was very important and very difficult period of time. </sentence><sentence id="256">As I told you, my father, it was a very well-known person in <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="257">A very honest man, with a... with a high degree of dignity and pride. </sentence><sentence id="258">If he borrows from somebody...somebody something, every penny he give back. </sentence><sentence id="259">And he kept his whole word. </sentence><sentence id="260">So I told you that Sunday morning, on June 22nd, we were sent to the <span class="populated place">camp</span> to..to <span class="populated place">Tirgu Jiu</span>. </sentence><sentence id="261">So it was Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday...somebody knocked to our <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="262">We know--my father told me, my mother-- they
