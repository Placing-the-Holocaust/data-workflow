<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="29">Q: And what what what was that like? </sentence><sentence id="30">What kind of <span class="building">housing</span>...what kind of...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="33">A: It was very...we were very badly treated, all of us. </sentence><sentence id="34">Incidentally, there was anti-Semitism in the army. </sentence><sentence id="35">There was no anti-Semitism in the all-Czechoslovakia, in <span class="region">Bohemia and Moravia</span> but there was anti-Semitism, even anti-Semitic remarks made by officers. </sentence><sentence id="36">The army was very badly treated by the French. </sentence><sentence id="37">It was ill-equipped. </sentence><sentence id="38">It was...the food was bad. </sentence><sentence id="39">We lived in <span class="building">barracks</span> where the wind was blowing through and there happened to be...we were in the south of <span class="country">France</span> where generally the the climate is mild, but it was a very cold winter, the winter of 1939-1940. </sentence><sentence id="40">And we believed we are kind of parade army and we will be used when <span class="country">Germany</span> is defeated, we will be used as the as the core of the Czech army, which will move back to <span class="populated place">Prague</span>, but when <span class="country">France</span> suffered one defeat after the other, in May 1940 we were well-equipped, or relatively well-equipped and we were sent to the <span class="region">front</span> and we were...we were positioned uh east of <span class="populated place">Paris</span> as part of the army to defend <span class="populated place">Paris</span> and the <span class="region">front</span> was broken and we retreated. </sentence><sentence id="41">We were again...I...my...there there were only small <span class="spatial object">units</span> left. </sentence><sentence id="42">This <span class="building">unit</span> in with which I was was again used at the <span class="env feature">River</span> and that was the end of the of the campaign of <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="43"><span class="country">France</span> was defeated and uh I like other people tried to get away from <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="44">Now some people went to where the army in <span class="region">southern France</span>...where the army had originally been stationed. </sentence><sentence id="45">I tried to get to <span class="region">western France</span> and to get from <span class="region">western France</span> on a <span class="spatial object">ship</span> to to <span class="country">England</span> or to the <span class="region">west</span>, but I couldn't get on any <span class="spatial object">ship</span> and finally...finally I ended up at the at the <span class="dlf">Spanish frontier</span> together with some other boys and we thought we would go into <span class="country">Spain</span> so we were afraid of this because we guessed that uh in <span class="country">Franco Spain</span> we would be arrested and while we were approaching the <span class="dlf">frontier</span>, we learned from the radio that <span class="country">Germany</span> will not occupy the whole of <span class="country">France</span> but only a stretch of <span class="region">territory</span> uh inland from the <span class="env feature">Atlantic</span>, so when you were beyond this <span class="dlf">demarkation line</span>, you would be in unoccupied <span class="country">France</span>, so we didn't go to it. </sentence><sentence id="46">We went to <span class="country">Spain</span> and then to to this unoccupied part of <span class="country">France</span> and there I was together with French refugees, my comrades...they're not close friends but whom I had just met...and they went to a little <span class="populated place">village</span> in <span class="region">southern France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="47">There again I became...or not again, but first 1 became a teacher in a very interesting family. </sentence><sentence id="48">The family was in part very pro-German, very pro-German and the elder part...the elder parts of the family were happy that <span class="country">France</span> had been defeated and that was so because one of the ladies...it was a tremendous family...one of the ladies was the daughter of the French Prime Minister who in 19...in 1866...who in 1870 uh had declared war on <span class="country">Germany</span> and on Napoleon the Third and had said we enter this war with a light..-with a light-heart, light-heartedly, . </sentence><sentence id="49">And uh six weeks later they were beaten in , so this lady found a  The young people were...were anti-German. </sentence><sentence id="50">They were very nice and I stayed with them and I taught a little boy and a young girl until one day my wife, my present wife, came and found me there and we traveled together toto__, a little place, near near the <span class="populated place">city</span> of <span class="populated place">Lemouge</span> (ph) where her father and her mother had been and they found themselves after dramatic circumstances because millions of French people had left, had fled the Germans at this time, and uh I stayed with them but they had nothing to eat and I decided there...and they shared everything but I decided I can't stay with them, so I went on my way to <span class="populated place">Grenoble</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="51">Why <span class="populated place">Grenoble</span>? </sentence><sentence id="52">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="53">It was in the <span class="region">unoccupied zone</span> and there I was demobilized by the French and there I got a carde identite (ph) as a student. </sentence><sentence id="54">Now very few foreigners had a carde identite, a permission of staying in <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="55">I had one but it...from this I couldn't live and after many attempts to...after many attempts to to find some way of uh ma...making a living which I couldn't do, I I found a job as I told you before in <span class="region">western France</span>, again as a teacher in a family, in an aristocratic refuge family and I I decided to go there and but you you could only travel at this time with a special permit, de voyage (ph) it was called so I went to the police and asked for a de voyage and they told me why why you want to go there and I said my aunt is  anti-Jewish laws, generally when we had to deal with the police and even in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, we were not singled out as being Jews. </sentence><sentence id="56">There was no anti-Semitism except in there...I mean no open anti-Semitism except in in Government levels but we didn't hear any any anti- Jewish remarks and uh anti-Semitism came in to force for us only when we were deported, or when people were arrested as Jews, but that was much later. </sentence><sentence id="57">Of course, many French people might have lost their jobs or their <span class="building">business</span>, but I speak now from my own personal experience. </sentence><sentence id="58">There was no anti-Semitic movement or attitude. </sentence><sentence id="59">We were dirty foreigners. </sentence><sentence id="60">The French have an expression... . </sentence><sentence id="61">Dirty foreigner, and we belonged to the dirty foreigner who potentially took away...took away French jobs, but this reminds me that during my flight uh to the <span class="region">south</span> when the army was dispersed and I tried to go get on a <span class="spatial object">ship</span>, I was once by chance...in the very last days of the French campaign in a <span class="interior space">compartment</span>, a <span class="interior space">railroad compartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="62">There were three British students and a lady, and the lady turned out to be the wife of the French Ambassador to Franco, . </sentence><sentence id="63">She was Madame , and the Monsieur was the successor to , and she came into the <span class="interior space">compartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="64">She was very friendly and she said since . </sentence><sentence id="65">She says these are the German Jews who have done us this, and this  hundred fifty grams of bread. </sentence><sentence id="66">At noon...at...in the forenoon, in the morning, which was the basis of all our food. </sentence><sentence id="67">At noon we got a water soup with carrots or with uh onions and in the evening we got, believe it or not, one artichoke and some of for drink...long period...one artichoke or a little bit of artificial honey, sometimes a glass of uh of wine. </sentence><sentence id="68">Now wine has calories. </sentence><sentence id="69">The net effect of this was that uh if people didn't get help from outside, parcels or some help in some other way, they died after about one year, and many people died there. </sentence><sentence id="70">The regime was very strict and from time to time they shot somebody, always saying that the person wanted to escape and that was probably partly true but partly was other...their method of intimidating people. </sentence><sentence id="71">As I said, there were foreigners from all over Europe and the Gestapo came from time to time together with German officials and asked people whether they want to work voluntarily in <span class="country">Germany</span> and many people see that they can't survive, Poles in particular, Hungarians uh volunteered for work in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="72">I have read...I don't know anymore where, but I believe it's true...that there were other Jews from <span class="region">eastern Europe</span>, from <span class="country">Hungary</span>, who said they wantto__-- in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="73">Didn't say they were Jews. </sentence><sentence id="74">They were Hungarians, and they survived in this way as foreign workers in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="75">Uh I stayed there for two years and the hygienic conditions were horrible. </sentence><sentence id="76">We were filthy. </sentence><sentence id="77">We were dirty. </sentence><sentence id="78">We had nothing to eat. </sentence><sentence id="79">We had lice. </sentence><sentence id="80">We had fleas. </sentence><sentence id="81">Many people died, of course, from diseases, but... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="133">Q: Did you work? </sentence><sentence id="134">Was there work? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="137">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="138">We didn't have to work. </sentence><sentence id="139">We didn't have to work. </sentence><sentence id="140">We had to do some what they called </sentence></p><p><sentence id="141"> , some work in...for the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, you know, but otherwise we didn't have to work and being told all the time. </sentence><sentence id="142">I was...after...I don't know...after I was there for a while I was called and said...by the...by a captain whose name incidentally was Vernet, Captain Vernet, and Captain Vernet said you are here by mistake. </sentence><sentence id="143">Uh yes, we recognize you have been in the army and so we will send you to a better <span class="populated place">camp</span>, and that happened...I was in say a month and at the beginning it raised my my hope and my morale and I didn't believe inin___ anymore, but I got indeed some privilege because of their alleged mistake. </sentence><sentence id="144">I was made deputy postmaster, . </sentence><sentence id="145">That is to say I was allowed to </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="146">A: Uh | for instance, was reading a tremendous lot and many people were were reading a tremendous lot. </sentence><sentence id="147">Other people there were...I don't reca...there were small Jewish religious groups but I must repeat that wasn't a <span class="populated place">Jewish camp</span> so it was a <span class="populated place">camp</span> for foreigner, so many of the foreigners were Jewish, but except for knowing that there were Jewish, there was no identification of being Jewish and there were other religious groups, Jewish religious people which...whom I haven't seen in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>...I haven't seen any...a few I have to ...uh what did they do? </sentence><sentence id="148">They were desperate. </sentence><sentence id="149">Uh they played chess  There was a <span class="building">railroad station</span> of <span class="populated place">Vernet</span>, and you could see it. </sentence><sentence id="150">It was uh perhaps a mile away but you could see it, and we saw on the Sth or the 6th of uh August that there are <span class="spatial object">railroad cars</span> there which generally were not there and probably on the 6th, a great number of people were surrounded in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, because in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> we were...and you believed you are...you were free in the <span class="populated place">camp.</span> </sentence><sentence id="151">You can...within limits, you were free. </sentence><sentence id="152">We were surrounded and __ say they would be deported. </sentence><sentence id="153">Now all of them were Jews. </sentence><sentence id="154">There were many non-Jews in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, but I do believe we didn't realize that all of them were Jews because as I said before, there was...we didn't feel being Jews in this sense that we were singled out, and they were deported and they were marched to the <span class="building">station</span> and were deported. </sentence><sentence id="155">At the end of August of 1942, something uh incredible happened. </sentence><sentence id="156">Whole families came into the <span class="populated place">camp</span> and these were all Jews, people, Jewish people who had taken refuge in <span class="country">France</span> and who had managed to live outside <span class="populated place">camps</span>, who had some even jobs. </sentence><sentence id="157">How they managed, I don't know...if some lived from their savings and had some savings...but they were people living outside and they were all brought into the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, and that was far sensational. </sentence><sentence id="158">Not only...we had...there were no women in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, so there were not only men and women came in...whole families and children. </sentence><sentence id="159">We hadn't seen children for two years, and uh they were not badly treated. </sentence><sentence id="160">Uh they had enough to eat and they were, of course, deeply depressed and I guess they knew already but we might have heard too, that there were de...deportations of Jews to <span class="country">Germany</span> because I think some people listened...could listen or to the to the British broadcast. </sentence><sentence id="161">They had heard about it, so this was an all Jewish affair. </sentence><sentence id="162">That was very clear, and it was a deportation affair and the first <span class="spatial object">transport</span> was also deportation, but it wasn't very clear...didn't seem so much as a punishment. </sentence><sentence id="163">It could be interpreted as a...and since it was only men, it could be interpreted as meaning they are going to work. </sentence><sentence id="164">The Germans uh uh always hired people who were imprisoned or wanted those people in <span class="country">Germany</span> so that they took Jews to <span class="country">Germany</span> was a bit strange but we didn't think about this as far as I remember. </sentence><sentence id="165">It's now fifty years, but as far as I remember about the second time, this was ominous. </sentence><sentence id="166">This was dangerous, and we couldn't understand what it means. </sentence><sentence id="167">And there was in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> a group of perhaps fifteen, twenty people like I who had been in the French army, and we were suddenly separated from the others and we believed that we are separated because <span class="country">France</span> would never send the people who had...who have fought for <span class="country">France</span>, would never surrender those people to the enemy. </sentence><sentence id="168">On the contrary I mean what they did was to be sure that we don't run away, they...it wasn't impossible to run away. </sentence><sentence id="169">In spite of all the guards and for men like...who like me who had a right to be around in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> because I was postmaster, it would have been considerably possible, like in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> later. </sentence><sentence id="170">I'll tell you about it. </sentence><sentence id="171">It was possible, possible to run away. </sentence><sentence id="172">But what happened afterwards is the second question because where would you ever run. </sentence><sentence id="173">You had no papers. </sentence><sentence id="174">You had no mon...money. </sentence><sentence id="175">Uh people there are certainly hostile. </sentence><sentence id="176">If you were to knock at their <span class="dlf">door</span>, who would have helped you. </sentence><sentence id="177">But so they wanted to be sure that we don't run away, but we cer...we misinterpreted this. </sentence><sentence id="178">As a matter of fact there was in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> a French police officer who was and I was quite on good terms with him because he spoke  friendly way, and he had likewise because it was profound dishonor. </sentence><sentence id="179">The French  0 <span class="spatial object">freight car</span>, and we considered breaking out but again the question was, you know, we could have lifted the <span class="spatial object">boards</span>. </sentence><sentence id="180">There was nothing in the <span class="spatial object">freight car</span> but the boards. </sentence><sentence id="181">Uh perhaps you could have lifted them and jumped out and we were...also it was strange the French uh gendarmes, not not the Germans but uh then the question arose . </sentence><sentence id="182">Where are we going? </sentence><sentence id="183">We will be caught again. </sentence><sentence id="184">So after perhaps twenty-four hours, we came to <span class="populated place">Drancy</span> and that's in...and then then _-- <span class="populated place">Drancy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="185"><span class="region">Drancy</span> looked horrible. </sentence><sentence id="186">Drancy consisted of <span class="building">barracks</span> or which had been made for the French police before the war and which could not be occupied because they were wet and badly built, so they stood empty, I guess. </sentence><sentence id="187">I know...I think they stood empty before we came. </sentence><sentence id="188">Not only before we came...before <span class="populated place">Drancy</span> became a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="189">Uh we left incidentally on the Ist...on the 1st of September...the 1st of September of <span class="populated place">Vernet</span>. </sentence><sentence id="190">We were perhaps on the 2nd or the 3rd in <span class="populated place">Drancy</span>, which is in a <span class="populated place">suburb</span> of <span class="populated place">Paris</span>. </sentence><sentence id="191">It was fully of concentra...of uh of of uh <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span>. </sentence><sentence id="192">Of course, we couldn't see the whole thing. </sentence><sentence id="193">We know there were other <span class="region">sections</span>, except the <span class="region">section</span> where we were. </sentence><sentence id="194">We were put into <span class="interior space">rooms</span> which were full of uh rotten straw. </sentence><sentence id="195">It was rotting, you know. </sentence><sentence id="196">It's wet and rotting, and there we were waiting, and, of course, uh uh being very much concerned and preoccupied what's going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="197">It was a morbid situation already you know. </sentence><sentence id="198">Under the rotten straw and with children and uh old people and the complete uh uh the complete helplessness and the complete lack of uh of...we didn't know what's going to happen...to happen to us but we knew, of course, we are now in the clutches of the German and at night we heard sometimes shooting from other parts of the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="199">We didn't know what it means. </sentence><sentence id="200">I remember I | went to one of the <span class="dlf">barbed wires</span> and saw...and tried to see whether I can get...I can get out but it was out of questioning, and then after three or four days there, uh we were ordered to go down...down...we we were <span class="interior space">upstairs</span> I remember. </sentence><sentence id="201">We had to go <span class="interior space">downstairs</span>, you know, to the...to the <span class="dlf">platform</span> and on the <span class="dlf">platform</span> there was already the SS and with...with their customary politeness, shouting and beating and and uh sending us into the...into the <span class="spatial object">railroad cars</span>. </sentence><sentence id="202">Now, the <span class="dlf">French railroads</span> had on every...perhaps they have it to day...I don't think they have it today, but in the 2nd World War, an inscription saying forthe _. </sentence><sentence id="203">That was from the 1st World War and they still have it in the 2nd World War. </sentence><sentence id="204">For the . [ </sentence><sentence id="205">know we were, but I I know this from having read it  1 knew this. </sentence><sentence id="206">But we were never told, and I have always said, no Nazi ever now told why I was in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="207">I was never told why I was persecuted by the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="208">I would say...no, they didn't...but they treated us like Jews. </sentence><sentence id="209">I mean they treated us like uh like non-human beings. </sentence><sentence id="210">They beat us and they shouted and uh the worst thing which happened was when I stayed with the <span class="spatial object">French freight cars</span> were for forty...forty men or eight horses. </sentence><sentence id="211">I guess they put in about eighty people. </sentence><sentence id="212">I cannot say how many, but I do know when we were...when we came in, we came into the in the <span class="spatial object">freight</span>, into the <span class="spatial object">freight train</span>, on on the on the side opposite the <span class="dlf">door</span> were little...they're little <span class="dlf">openings</span> and they were with <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span>. </sentence><sentence id="213">You could look out there but not very well. </sentence><sentence id="214">It was pretty dark there, and it...we were so crowded that when you sat down, you couldn't stretch your leg. </sentence><sentence id="215">You...you couldn't move. </sentence><sentence id="216">You you were...you were fixed in this position. </sentence><sentence id="217">There were women, children, old people. </sentence><sentence id="218">They gave us...they gave us and I think they gave us enough  2 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="219">A: Bracelet...and it had a number...7 - 7 - 7, and here I have the number 1 -7-7-7-7-4, SO... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="221">Q: Uh Linda would like you to repeat the phrase about the bracelet so my voice isn't in there, so the only identity...just say it again. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="223">A: The only identity...iden...not id...identity, document or identity piece which I had on myself was a military bracelet which...from my military service in <span class="country">France</span> which had a number 7 - 7 - 7. </sentence><sentence id="224">And it...and I I threw away at this point. </sentence><sentence id="225">That's really the point I want to make. </sentence><sentence id="226">I threw it away somehow because I thought it would indicate that I have been in the French army, which was right, but the strange coincidence is that there were three 7's, and here I have four 7's on my...here. ( </sentence><sentence id="227">Cough) So after a couple of hours, pandemonium broke out. </sentence><sentence id="228">People were crying. </sentence><sentence id="229">People were uh shouting, wailing. </sentence><sentence id="230">It was...there was the terrible stench and people always...the <span class="spatial object">train</span> stopped quite often. </sentence><sentence id="231">I remember it stopped once I believe in <span class="populated place">Mintz</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="232"><span class="populated place">Mintz</span>, in in the <span class="region">Alsace</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="233">I I figured it's <span class="populated place">Mintz</span>, in the <span class="region">Alsace</span>. </sentence><sentence id="234">And people shouted to to the outside, open the <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="235">We want to so that we throw the the the excrements out and we want water, but the

on the <span class="dlf">platform</span> with a  3 they are trying to kill us there, so suddenly after three, or four or five days...I don't know...the <span class="spatial object">train</span> stopped in an open <span class="dlf">field</span> and we heard shout...shouting...shoutings...everybody...all men between I guess they said fifty and...fifteen and fifty...1 don't know...something

walked...we we run down the <span class="dlf">hill</span>, and the SS came and and uh and uh uh pushed all the people back, but you see there were some younger people, young men who didn't want to separate from their families. </sentence><sentence id="243">They didn't want to come down, so they tried to get them down and the same woman who had shown her child in the <span class="spatial

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="305">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="306">The <span class="spatial object">train</span> stopped near a little <span class="populated place">town</span>

that I speak about this because people think of gas and beating and sickness and starvation, but  5 Kubacheck (ph), and when the <span class="spatial object">train</span> moved west and we moved to , he was standing next to me and suddenly started to talk to me. </sentence><sentence id="310">He said to me, I am not Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="311">I am a Polish officer, and I cannot say that I am a Polish officer because...you see, he had some confidence in me because I had given him...I had preserved his nice stamps, and if he dared to say that he is a Polish officer, they would take him out and kill him. </sentence><sentence id="312">And he later on...I'll tell you later on...he helped me. </sentence><sentence id="313">He really saved my life twice, so it was Stanislov Kubacheck and then we...the <span class="spatial object">train</span> went west and we came to a <span class="populated place">camp</span> called <span class="populated place">Lauerhutte</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="314">Now <span class="building">Lauerhutte</span>...you know what a <span class="building">hutte</span> is...a <span class="building">hutte</span> in German is a combination

<span class="populated place">Paris</span>, <span class="populated place">Drancy</span>, the first of September and we came there around the middle of September. </sentence><sentence id="318">By the beginning of November, about one third, all the Dutch were gone. </sentence><sentence id="319">All the Dutch who had...didn't survive <span class="populated place">Kozel</span>, had died. </sentence><sentence id="320">And the people who died and every day people died, the people who died...we were in this big <span class="interior space">room</span> where there had been <span

was a a team (ph) which didn't do anything else but the whole day they they they carried the dead people out and uh and as I said, by November I guess one third of the people had died, and new people came in. </sentence><sentence id="322">Uh at this time, before this happened, I was once ordered to go by <span class="spatial object">truck</span> to the <span class="building">station</span>...now I don't know whether whether <span class="populated place">Lauerhutte</span> had a <span class="building">station</span> or whether it was , to a <span class="building">station</span> and I was sitting with another buddy, with another inmate,  7 could ask for sick leave...sick leave...you could ask not to go to <span class="building">work</span> for one day but it was very dangerous because when you came to the <span class="dlf">sick bay</span> and then you went... . </sentence><sentence id="323">Lwas so weak I stayed in <span class="spatial object">bed</span> andI didn't want to go. </sentence><sentence id="324">I was what happened. </sentence><sentence id="325">I couldn't anymore and this Stanislov Kubacheck, this Polish officer who had become a kapo, helped me. </sentence><sentence id="326">In the first place, the <span class="building">kapo</span> has...had to...had to watch whether his people got one ration...got their food, and he had to watch others that they don't don't come twice and take food twice, so he allowed me to go twice. </sentence><sentence id="327">I was the first and came the last one. </sentence><sentence id="328">Then he took me to his commander in his team and I didn't have to work, so I recovered and I must say amongst the many circumstances why I survived, that was one, but it's only one because there were thousands other dangers which I was exposed to and that's then another story. </sentence><sentence id="329">Uh I must say from <span class="populated place">Lauerhutte</span> we also were sent to work in combination. </sentence><sentence id="330">I don't remember  8 what and it was very difficult to help people back. </sentence><sentence id="331">And from time to time there were selections, particularly these prisoners were sent out because they couldn't work but we didn't quite understand why that was. </sentence><sentence id="332">Uh but we did understand because I want to say now at the end of our stay in in <span class="populated place">Lauerhutte</span>, we had a very good Polish master. </sentence><sentence id="333">We worked in a <span class="building">factory</span> under German masters or Polish masters and we were watched and guarded by by these uh SR or whatever they were, and it was known that we would uh be transferred and he thought we would be sent to the gas and so he was very kind and sad. </sentence><sentence id="334">He gave us cigarettes and then one day we were...we were transferred in August of 1943 and we went to <span class="populated place">Blechhammer</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="335">Now <span class="populated place">Lauerhutte</span> was a small <span class="populated place">camp</span> and it was an outside <span class="populated place">camp</span>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="387">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="388">And in <span class="populated place">Blechhammer</span>, after a short period where we were guarded by the German

the SS. </sentence><sentence id="391">Uh there is a very good book by who wrote....  9 where I had it...a spoon, but there were people who had nothing of this, so they would get their food in a big

we worked...we were in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> and we got up in the summer at five o'clock...no, in the summer at four or three o'clock. </sentence><sentence id="394">In the winter later and we worked from six in the morning to six in the evening, twelve hours. </sentence><sentence id="395">We worked on various jobs and the type of job you had depended...determined very

</sentence><sentence id="397">You were not exposed to this and I must say in <span class="populated place">Blechhammer</span> I worked on construction work, but I was able to make it and then then I had light...light work, and the last job I had in <span class="populated place">Blechhammer</span> was...there were...there there were...and there were...all the <span class="dlf">windows</span> were broken from bombings and so we had to fit in uh cardboards where the the glass had been. </sentence><sentence id="398">I must tell you that <span class="building">Blechhammer</span> was one of the <span class="building">German factories</span> where oil, petrol, gasoline was derived from coal. </sentence><sentence id="399">It was one of the most important <span class="building">German

when the Germans lost uh <span class="dlf">Romanian oil fields</span>, they were of of utmost strategic importance and I'll tell you later on about the bombing. </sentence><sentence id="400">Uh how should I systematize <span class="building">Blechhammer</span>. </sentence><sentence id="401">I've told you about uh there being various nationalities, and uh we had to walk about two, three

see from all sides the people marching towards the <span class="building">factory</span> and uh we were surrounded on both sides by the <span class="spatial object">SS</span> which had like long whips with  0 end...at the point which I am now talking about...there were some thirty children and Demera, the lageraltester, the head of the of the <span class="populated place">camp,</span> the Jewish head of the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, was afraid that his child and his children who were badly...who were well treated, they had enough to eat...the Germans gave them enough to eat,

parasites. </sentence><sentence id="409">We need to have children, the children work. </sentence><sentence id="410">And a <span class="spatial object">column</span> was created, a <span class="spatial

children...the SS on both sides with its sticks and with whips and its machine guns and all the five thousand people in this __ this way and the thirty children. </sentence><sentence id="416">Now when we met the other prisoners, the French prisoners, the British prisoners, everybody started to shout and to to whistle and to call shame on the Germans and the SS itself was embarrassed and they did react, so we walked with the children to our assigned <span class="populated place">working place</span> and there somebody uh uh a <span class="spatial object">kapo</span> appeared and said the children have to do the following. </sentence><sentence id="417">There are stones on this side of the <span class="dlf">road</span> and they have to bring the stones to the other side of the <span

then he said to me, isn't it a pity. </sentence><sentence id="426">Such a nice boy, but he is Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="427">He must die. </sentence><sentence id="428">Now the <span
