( </sentence><sentence id="37">Pause - drinking) Now we lived a happy life until 1938 when the Germans came and expelled my family. </sentence><sentence id="38">I was at this time in <span class="country">France</span> in order to study and I stayed in <span class="country">France</span> in <span class="populated place">Paris</span> until February 1939. </sentence><sentence id="39">We had no money. </sentence><sentence id="40">I was hungry, but really not starving but hungry, pretty hungry, so I decided to go back to <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> and my parents lived in the internal part of <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>, in <span class="populated place">Burno</span> (ph), <span class="populated place">Burn</span> (ph), and they came there and after two, three weeks being there, the Germans occupied the rest and from there my adventure started. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="41">Q: Before you go into that, tell us a little bit more about what you were doing, how you came to go to <span class="country">France</span> to study? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="42">A: I was...I have <span class="building">German schools</span>, and I was studying in <span class="populated place">Prague</span> from "36 to "38... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="44">Q: What were you studying? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="46">A: At the <span class="building">German university</span>, I was first studying medicine, which I gave up, and then I studied uh uh philosophy and uh romance language and that's why I went to <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="48">Q: I see. </sentence><sentence id="49">And when you came to <span class="country">France</span>, where did you go to <span class="building">school</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="52">A: Well, I was first in <span class="populated place">Tulle</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="53"><span class="populated place">Tulle</span> is a <span class="populated place">city</span> west of <span class="populated place">Paris</span> and then when <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>...when and <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> had to cede its <span class="region">territory</span>, the so- called <span class="region">territory</span>, uh I went back to <span class="populated place">Paris</span> and then I still inscribed (ph) at <span class="building">Sorbonne</span>, but I cannot say that I studied much because we had other problems. </sentence><sentence id="54">So I was there until about February 1939 and came back to see my parents and hardly was I there that the Germans occupied <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>, the rest of <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>, and I had very great difficulty to get out. </sentence><sentence id="55">I was arrested by the Nazis in <span class="populated place">Bruno</span>. </sentence><sentence id="56">Then when they came to <span class="populated place">Prague</span>, you had to go to the Gestapo to get permission to leave the <span class="country">country</span> and I had...I had a lot of luck in my life. </sentence><sentence id="57">The very fact that I am here proves it, but I want to tell you one story how the Gestapo...there were some eight hundred thousand people were waiting in front of the <span class="building">Gestapo building</span> to get in and get permission and the SS that I saw for the first time the SS was in the back and was beating the people but the people didn't dare to leave because they had to get their permission to leave the <span class="country">country</span>, and the Gestapo distributed about twenty numbers. </sentence><sentence id="58">They said we are going to go by numbers. </sentence><sentence id="59">There were eight hundred people and uh there were about uh uh twenty numbers given out. </sentence><sentence id="60">I also got a number, but when they started to call numbers and I looked for my number in the pocket, I gave them what was apparently the checking number of a <span class="building">movie house</span>, you know, I had left in my coat...it was number four. </sentence><sentence id="61">The man...the man didn't see that there was...that the paper is different from what they...four...he let me in. </sentence><sentence id="62">So I got out and I came to <span class="country">France</span> and stayed in <span class="country">France</span> until the outbreak of the war. </sentence><sentence id="63">I stayed longer there, but until the outbreak of the war I also met at this time Elizabeth, my present wife, and when the war broke out in 1939 I volunteered for the French army. </sentence><sentence id="64">All Czech citizens had however to join a unit which was part of the French army but we had the command language was Czech, so I was with this Czech army unit uh from October 1939 to the breakdown of <span class="country">France</span>, and I should say a few words about this this Czech army unit. </sentence><sentence id="65">It consisted basically of three groups...Slovaks which had been settled in <span class="country">France</span> for a long time, which had been mobilized and which had to join this army and they were very unhappy about it because they want to join the French army, so it was the French army but it was a Czech unit. </sentence><sentence id="66">Uh Czechs which had escaped from <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> from Hitler, from occupied <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> and a great number of Jews. </sentence><sentence id="67">Perhaps forty percent of the people were Jews. </sentence><sentence id="68">These were people who had fled from <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> to what was then <span class="country">Palestine</span> and had volunteered in <span class="country">Palestine</span> to join the ar...the Czech army in <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="69"> Uh one of them is the famous uh published Maxwell who bought one of the <span class="populated place">New York</span>...that's the <span class="building">New York Post</span>...one of the <span class="building">New York papers</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="88">Q: Did you serve with these people? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="90">A: Yeah, and I served with these people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="92">Q: And what what what was that like? </sentence><sentence id="93">What kind of <span class="building">housing</span>...what kind of...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="96">A: It was very...we were very badly treated, all of us. </sentence><sentence id="97">Incidentally, there was anti-Semitism in the army. </sentence><sentence id="98">There was no anti-Semitism in the all-Czechoslovakia, in <span class="region">Bohemia and Moravia</span> but there was anti-Semitism, even anti-Semitic remarks made by officers. </sentence><sentence id="99">The army was very badly treated by the French. </sentence><sentence id="100">It was ill-equipped. </sentence><sentence id="101">It was...the food was bad. </sentence><sentence id="102">We lived in <span class="building">barracks</span> where the wind was blowing through and there happened to be...we were in the south of <span class="country">France</span> where generally the the climate is mild, but it was a very cold winter, the winter of 1939-1940. </sentence><sentence id="103">And we believed we are kind of parade army and we will be used when <span class="country">Germany</span> is defeated, we will be used as the as the core of the Czech army, which will move back to <span class="populated place">Prague</span>, but when <span class="country">France</span> suffered one defeat after the other, in May 1940 we were well-equipped, or relatively well-equipped and we were sent to the <span class="region">front</span> and we were...we were positioned uh east of <span class="populated place">Paris</span> as part of the army to defend <span class="populated place">Paris</span> and the <span class="region">front</span> was broken and we retreated. </sentence><sentence id="104">We were again...I...my...there there were only small <span class="spatial object">units</span> left. </sentence><sentence id="105">This <span class="building">unit</span> in with which I was was again used at the <span class="env feature">River</span> and that was the end of the of the campaign of <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="106"><span class="country">France</span> was defeated and uh I like other people tried to get away from <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="107">Now some people went to where the army in <span class="region">southern France</span>...where the army had originally been stationed. </sentence><sentence id="108">I tried to get to <span class="region">western France</span> and to get from <span class="region">western France</span> on a <span class="spatial object">ship</span> to to <span class="country">England</span> or to the <span class="region">west</span>, but I couldn't get on any <span class="spatial object">ship</span> and finally...finally I ended up at the at the <span class="dlf">Spanish frontier</span> together with some other boys and we thought we would go into <span class="country">Spain</span> so we were afraid of this because we guessed that uh in <span class="country">Franco Spain</span> we would be arrested and while we were approaching the <span class="dlf">frontier</span>, we learned from the radio that <span class="country">Germany</span> will not occupy the whole of <span class="country">France</span> but only a stretch of <span class="region">territory</span> uh inland from the <span class="env feature">Atlantic</span>, so when you were beyond this <span class="dlf">demarkation line</span>, you would be in unoccupied <span class="country">France</span>, so we didn't go to it. </sentence><sentence id="109">We went to <span class="country">Spain</span> and then to to this unoccupied part of <span class="country">France</span> and there I was together with French refugees, my comrades...they're not close friends but whom I had just met...and they went to a little <span class="populated place">village</span> in <span class="region">southern France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="110">There again I became...or not again, but first 1 became a teacher in a very interesting family. </sentence><sentence id="111">The family was in part very pro-German, very pro-German and the elder part...the elder parts of the family were happy that <span class="country">France</span> had been defeated and that was so because one of the ladies...it was a tremendous family...one of the ladies was the daughter of the French Prime Minister who in 19...in 1866...who in 1870 uh had declared war on <span class="country">Germany</span> and on Napoleon the Third and had said we enter this war with a light..-with a light-heart, light-heartedly, . </sentence><sentence id="112">And uh six weeks later they were beaten in , So this lady found a certain satisfaction in the fact that not only her father and her friends under her father's regime had been defeated but but also...but also <span class="country">France</span> again, but they were very nice. </sentence><sentence id="113"> The young people were...were anti-German. </sentence><sentence id="114">They were very nice and I stayed with them and I taught a little boy and a young girl until one day my wife, my present wife, came and found me there and we traveled together toto__, a little place, near near the <span class="populated place">city</span> of <span class="populated place">Lemouge</span> (ph) where her father and her mother had been and they found themselves after dramatic circumstances because millions of French people had left, had fled the Germans at this time, and uh I stayed with them but they had nothing to eat and I decided there...and they shared everything but I decided I can't stay with them, so I went on my way to <span class="populated place">Grenoble</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="115">Why <span class="populated place">Grenoble</span>? </sentence><sentence id="116">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="117">It was in the <span class="region">unoccupied zone</span> and there I was demobilized by the French and there I got a carde identite (ph) as a student. </sentence><sentence id="118">Now very few foreigners had a carde identite, a permission of staying in <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="119">I had one but it...from this I couldn't live and after many attempts to...after many attempts to to find some way of uh ma...making a living which I couldn't do, I I found a job as I told you before in <span class="region">western France</span>, again as a teacher in a family, in an aristocratic refuge family and I I decided to go there and but you you could only travel at this time with a special permit, de voyage (ph) it was called so I went to the police and asked for a de voyage and they told me why why you want to go there and I said my aunt is sick because...it wasn't very cleaver but I had no better.. nothing better in mind, so uh they didn't give it. </sentence><sentence id="120">They said uh bring me a certificate from the doctor of your aunt, so of course | didn't bring any. </sentence><sentence id="121">I took the <span class="spatial object">train</span> and went to this place and I was there for several weeks, but this place was...this family lived in a little <span class="populated place">village</span>, had a very nice <span class="building">house</span> in this <span class="populated place">village</span> and of course the people saw me. </sentence><sentence id="122">I was a foreigner there and the police there uh paid attention to me and I had not...I should have registered with the police. </sentence><sentence id="123">I should...I didn't register. </sentence><sentence id="124">I didn't do anything, so after three days...after three weeks, I was arrested and I was sent to the <span class="populated place">County Vernet</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="125">Uh now that was a very arbitrary act because the <span class="populated place">County Vernet</span> of which I will speak immediately was one of the worst <span class="populated place">camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="126">It was the worst <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> in <span class="country">France</span> as far as I know, but uh I was sent there. </sentence><sentence id="127">I was sent with uh together with a pastor, a Romanian pastor who in 19 uh...a protestant pastor who in 1934 had crossed the <span class="dlf">Place de la Concorde</span> (ph) in <span class="populated place">Paris</span> during big demonstrations and he was stopped and he showed his identity card. </sentence><sentence id="128">He was released but apparently...he had nothing to do with this demonstration. </sentence><sentence id="129">He was a <span class="building">church</span> man. </sentence><sentence id="130">They took his identity and then they caught him somewhere and they had his identity that he participated, he was in this demonstration. </sentence><sentence id="131">So uh he was with me and then a poor Portuguese worker who apparently was in the same situation as I had been, working without permission and had been there without identity card, so we got sent to <span class="populated place">Vernet</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="169">Q: And you were arrested not as a Jew but as a...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="171">A: Not as a Jew. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="173">Q: Could you talk a little bit about that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="175">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="176">It's important to realize because projections back often...are often misleading that while in the fall of 1940, the Vichy government started to issue uh anti-Semitic,  anti-Jewish laws, generally when we had to deal with the police and even in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, we were not singled out as being Jews. </sentence><sentence id="177">There was no anti-Semitism except in there...I mean no open anti-Semitism except in in Government levels but we didn't hear any any anti- Jewish remarks and uh anti-Semitism came in to force for us only when we were deported, or when people were arrested as Jews, but that was much later. </sentence><sentence id="178">Of course, many French people might have lost their jobs or their <span class="building">business</span>, but I speak now from my own personal experience. </sentence><sentence id="179">There was no anti-Semitic movement or attitude. </sentence><sentence id="180">We were dirty foreigners. </sentence><sentence id="181">The French have an expression... . </sentence><sentence id="182">Dirty foreigner, and we belonged to the dirty foreigner who potentially took away...took away French jobs, but this reminds me that during my flight uh to the <span class="region">south</span> when the army was dispersed and I tried to go get on a <span class="spatial object">ship</span>, I was once by chance...in the very last days of the French campaign in a <span class="interior space">compartment</span>, a <span class="interior space">railroad compartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="183">There were three British students and a lady, and the lady turned out to be the wife of the French Ambassador to Franco, . </sentence><sentence id="184">She was Madame , and the Monsieur was the successor to , and she came into the <span class="interior space">compartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="185">She was very friendly and she said since . </sentence><sentence id="186">She says these are the German Jews who have done us this, and this slogan you heard very often, but that was general. </sentence><sentence id="187">That was government propaganda. </sentence><sentence id="188">I personally didn't experience nor observe any anti-Semitism until much later. </sentence><sentence id="189">This was a very, very very populist organi...in the <span class="dlf">right wing circles</span>. </sentence><sentence id="190">The Ger...German Jews have done us this. </sentence><sentence id="191">This incidentally comes...goes back to the Dreyfuss (ph) affair, because he was a German Jew for...they was also persecuted him. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="210">Q: And once you were interned at <span class="populated place">Vernet</span>...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="212">A: Now I have to speak about <span class="populated place">Vernet</span> first and describe it. </sentence><sentence id="213"><span class="populated place">Vernet</span> was a <span class="populated place">camp</span> erected in the 1st World War for Austrian prisoners of war, for Austrian prisoners of war, for their Austrian soldiers at the <span class="region">German front</span> uh front uh in 1914, 1918, and when they were captured, they were imprisoned there and in 1939 the <span class="populated place">camp</span> was used to imprison dangerous foreigners, and these were primarily Germans, Nazis, Nazis who had been caught in <span class="country">France</span> and who hadn't returned...returned in time and then also foreign communists because they were also considered dangerous in view of the fact that uh communists were against the war at the very beginning. </sentence><sentence id="214">They said Hitler and the western powers, that Hitler and the western powers are the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="215">It's an imperialistic war as they said. </sentence><sentence id="216">Now uh when <span class="country">France</span> was defeated, the Nazis who had been imprisoned there, were freed and in addition to Communists, all kinds of people were imprisoned there and there was no longer a question of being dangerous to <span class="country">France</span> or not dangerous to <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="217">Uh people were imprisoned there, and I will tell you was imprisoned at the end before ____, before we were deported. </sentence><sentence id="218">There were people from all over <span class="country">Europe</span>. </sentence><sentence id="219">They were , for instance German first one you was imprisoned there and then...not in my time anyway. </sentence><sentence id="220">He got out. </sentence><sentence id="221">And then Otto Kirsler (ph), the the British, the Hungarian-British writer, and uh it was a horrible <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="222">The horror of the <span class="populated place">camp</span> consisted in the fact that perhaps it was different before but after the defeat, <span class="country">France</span> started to ration. </sentence><sentence id="223">Food was scarce and the food they gave to the prisoners was a hunger ration. </sentence><sentence id="224">You got something black in the morning which was supposed to be coffee, two  hundred fifty grams of bread. </sentence><sentence id="225">At noon...at...in the forenoon, in the morning, which was the basis of all our food. </sentence><sentence id="226">At noon we got a water soup with carrots or with uh onions and in the evening we got, believe it or not, one artichoke and some of for drink...long period...one artichoke or a little bit of artificial honey, sometimes a glass of uh of wine. </sentence><sentence id="227">Now wine has calories. </sentence><sentence id="228">The net effect of this was that uh if people didn't get help from outside, parcels or some help in some other way, they died after about one year, and many people died there. </sentence><sentence id="229">The regime was very strict and from time to time they shot somebody, always saying that the person wanted to escape and that was probably partly true but partly was other...their method of intimidating people. </sentence><sentence id="230">As I said, there were foreigners from all over Europe and the Gestapo came from time to time together with German officials and asked people whether they want to work voluntarily in <span class="country">Germany</span> and many people see that they can't survive, Poles in particular, Hungarians uh volunteered for work in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="231">I have read...I don't know anymore where, but I believe it's true...that there were other Jews from <span class="region">eastern Europe</span>, from <span class="country">Hungary</span>, who said they wantto__-- in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="232">Didn't say they were Jews. </sentence><sentence id="233">They were Hungarians, and they survived in this way as foreign workers in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="234">Uh I stayed there for two years and the hygienic conditions were horrible. </sentence><sentence id="235">We were filthy. </sentence><sentence id="236">We were dirty. </sentence><sentence id="237">We had nothing to eat. </sentence><sentence id="238">We had lice. </sentence><sentence id="239">We had fleas. </sentence><sentence id="240">Many people died, of course, from diseases, but... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="275">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="276">We didn't have to work. </sentence><sentence id="277">We didn't have to work. </sentence><sentence id="278">We had to do some what they called , some work in...for the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, you know, but otherwise we didn't have to work and being told all the time. </sentence><sentence id="279">I was...after...I don't know...after I was there for a while I was called and said...by the...by a captain whose name incidentally was Vernet, Captain Vernet, and Captain Vernet said you are here by mistake. </sentence><sentence id="280">Uh yes, we recognize you have been in the army and so we will send you to a better <span class="populated place">camp</span>, and that happened...I was in say a month and at the beginning it raised my my hope and my morale and I didn't believe inin___ anymore, but I got indeed some privilege because of their alleged mistake. </sentence><sentence id="281">I was made deputy postmaster, . </sentence><sentence id="282">That is to say I was allowed to work...I was allowed to work at the <span class="building">post office</span> and that was from a moral point of view very helpful because I was busy with something. </sentence><sentence id="283">I was distributing letters and uh parcels but I was...I was terribly...my wife had sent me for a while food but then she left <span class="country">France</span> and I suffered terribly from hunger. </sentence><sentence id="284">It's there where I started to smoke because when you smoke, it seems that the the smoke, when you inhale the smoke, would would pacify the hunger pangs and it it hurt badly but in reality it was burning. </sentence><sentence id="285">You know, the smoke just gave you a burning feeling, and it was very very uh very very painful. </sentence><sentence id="286">Hunger was the great problem there and, of course, hunger was the one problem. </sentence><sentence id="287">The other great problem was the lack of liberty. </sentence><sentence id="288">I was a young person and uh we lived there like animals, imprisoned there. </sentence><sentence id="289">We hadn't done anything. </sentence><sentence id="290">So it was very, very depressing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="308">Q: How did people spend hours of the day? </sentence><sentence id="309">What did they do with themselves? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="310">A: Uh | for instance, was reading a tremendous lot and many people were were reading a tremendous lot. </sentence><sentence id="311">Other people there were...I don't reca...there were small Jewish religious groups but I must repeat that wasn't a <span class="populated place">Jewish camp</span> so it was a <span class="populated place">camp</span> for foreigner, so many of the foreigners were Jewish, but except for knowing that there were Jewish, there was no identification of being Jewish and there were other religious groups, Jewish religious people which...whom I haven't seen in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>...I haven't seen any...a few I have to ..uh what did they do? </sentence><sentence id="312">They were desperate. </sentence><sentence id="313">Uh they played chess and they they were singing and they were...for instance, we had to...we had...we had no <span class="spatial object">group toilet</span>. </sentence><sentence id="314">We had big <span class="spatial object">containers</span> and we had to carry it out to the peasants and some people when we...when we carried this out to the peasants, some people would exchange a shirt and the peasant would uh would give you some bread or something, but they would also give you...give you wheat but and we had a very primitive <span class="building">mill</span> there which somebody had constructed and we milled the wheat and from time to time we made a big uh a big uh feast, you know, out of it. </sentence><sentence id="315">We we cooked...we boiled the wheat and that was a great feast because people had saved for this and people had gotten parcels. </sentence><sentence id="316">Some people got <span class="dlf">parcels</span>. </sentence><sentence id="317">It was also from a moral point of view very, very depressing. </sentence><sentence id="318">You were a prisoner, but a prisoner who was innocent, a prisoner who couldn't say oh, hadn't I done this, because we hadn't done anything. </sentence><sentence id="319">The one thing which kept our morale up and that is true of this period and that is true of the...of <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> later on, was the war. </sentence><sentence id="320">We had a feeling unlike the prisoners who were sent by Stalin to <span class="region">Siberia</span>, who had no hopes that Stalinism would ever end, we had a great hope that the war will end and <span class="country">Nazi Germany</span> will be defeated and we had a feeling that the others, our friends, people fight for us. </sentence><sentence id="321">That kept the morale up and we followed very closely political events. </sentence><sentence id="322">We could have papers in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> and some people had Swiss papers and uh we always hoped now that they will be defeated now, now they will be defeated...never were defeated. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="323">Q: Uh was there a sense that that there was a time limit to how long you would be there or this was just an interminable thing? </sentence><sentence id="324">You you would...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="327">A: It was interminable, because every event like for instance uh well, in our case it was the...it was the attack of <span class="country">Russia</span> by the Nazis, where we believed that will be the end of <span class="country">Germany</span>, but later on in <span class="country">Germany</span> when we learned about the invasion of Europe by the Allies, by the American and British armies, we always believed now it's the end. </sentence><sentence id="328">It was never the end. </sentence><sentence id="329">It was very frustrating. </sentence><sentence id="330">I mean never. </sentence><sentence id="331">But uh I've never been in a <span class="building">prison</span> by I mean in a <span class="building">prison</span>, people think they have done something and if they're they're...they were innocently imprisoned, and then they had a time limit on their stay. </sentence><sentence id="332">They're there for...they're there for for for life...they have a life sentence, but there there was no hope except the end of the war and a victorious end of the war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="339">Q: And would you tell us now about when you were deported, how that happened, how you felt, the people that you had to leave or went with you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="341">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="342">On the 7th of August, 1942...let me say perhaps on the 6th of August, 1942...no. </sentence><sentence id="343">Let me say on the 6th or Sth, we could see from the <span class="populated place">camp</span> the little <span class="building">station</span> of ___--~ <span class="populated place">Vernet</span>. </sentence><sentence id="344"> There was a <span class="building">railroad station</span> of <span class="populated place">Vernet</span>, and you could see it. </sentence><sentence id="345">It was uh perhaps a mile away but you could see it, and we saw on the Sth or the 6th of uh August that there are <span class="spatial object">railroad cars</span> there which generally were not there and probably on the 6th, a great number of people were surrounded in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, because in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> we were...and you believed you are...you were free in the <span class="populated place">camp.</span> </sentence><sentence id="346">You can...within limits, you were free. </sentence><sentence id="347">We were surrounded and __ say they would be deported. </sentence><sentence id="348">Now all of them were Jews. </sentence><sentence id="349">There were many non-Jews in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, but I do believe we didn't realize that all of them were Jews because as I said before, there was...we didn't feel being Jews in this sense that we were singled out, and they were deported and they were marched to the <span class="building">station</span> and were deported. </sentence><sentence id="350">At the end of August of 1942, something uh incredible happened. </sentence><sentence id="351">Whole families came into the <span class="populated place">camp</span> and these were all Jews, people, Jewish people who had taken refuge in <span class="country">France</span> and who had managed to live outside <span class="populated place">camps</span>, who had some even jobs. </sentence><sentence id="352">How they managed, I don't know...if some lived from their savings and had some savings...but they were people living outside and they were all brought into the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, and that was far sensational. </sentence><sentence id="353">Not only...we had...there were no women in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, so there were not only men and women came in...whole families and children. </sentence><sentence id="354">We hadn't seen children for two years, and uh they were not badly treated. </sentence><sentence id="355">Uh they had enough to eat and they were, of course, deeply depressed and I guess they knew already but we might have heard too, that there were de...deportations of Jews to <span class="country">Germany</span> because I think some people listened...could listen or to the to the British broadcast. </sentence><sentence id="356">They had heard about it, so this was an all Jewish affair. </sentence><sentence id="357">That was very clear, and it was a deportation affair and the first <span class="spatial object">transport</span> was also deportation, but it wasn't very clear...didn't seem so much as a punishment. </sentence><sentence id="358">It could be interpreted as a...and since it was only men, it could be interpreted as meaning they are going to work. </sentence><sentence id="359">The Germans uh uh always hired people who were imprisoned or wanted those people in <span class="country">Germany</span> so that they took Jews to <span class="country">Germany</span> was a bit strange but we didn't think about this as far as I remember. </sentence><sentence id="360">It's now fifty years, but as far as I remember about the second time, this was ominous. </sentence><sentence id="361">This was dangerous, and we couldn't understand what it means. </sentence><sentence id="362">And there was in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> a group of perhaps fifteen, twenty people like I who had been in the French army, and we were suddenly separated from the others and we believed that we are separated because <span class="country">France</span> would never send the people who had...who have fought for <span class="country">France</span>, would never surrender those people to the enemy. </sentence><sentence id="363">On the contrary I mean what they did was to be sure that we don't run away, they...it wasn't impossible to run away. </sentence><sentence id="364">In spite of all the guards and for men like...who like me who had a right to be around in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> because I was postmaster, it would have been considerably possible, like in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> later. </sentence><sentence id="365">I'll tell you about it. </sentence><sentence id="366">It was possible, possible to run away. </sentence><sentence id="367">But what happened afterwards is the second question because where would you ever run. </sentence><sentence id="368">You had no papers. </sentence><sentence id="369">You had no mon...money. </sentence><sentence id="370">Uh people there are certainly hostile. </sentence><sentence id="371">If you were to knock at their <span class="dlf">door</span>, who would have helped you. </sentence><sentence id="372">But so they wanted to be sure that we don't run away, but we cer...we misinterpreted this. </sentence><sentence id="373">As a matter of fact there was in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> a French police officer who was and I was quite on good terms with him because he spoke German. </sentence><sentence id="374">I spoke German with him. </sentence><sentence id="375">One day...and on this day he came and said I have to arrest you, and he arrest me to bring me in the group of the former soldiers and when I realized what I...what he was saying, I spit at him and he slapped me, but it was ina  friendly way, and he had likewise because it was profound dishonor. </sentence><sentence id="376">The French think their honor is...their honor has been maintained, the honor of the French army. </sentence><sentence id="377">It was profound dishonor to sen...to send off...apart from everybody else certainly, but to send off to <span class="country">Germany</span>, because the Germans could have killed us immediately. </sentence><sentence id="378">I mean we were...they could have said we...you are former citizens of a <span class="region">territory</span> which we have occupied. </sentence><sentence id="379">Therefore, it's against your own <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="380">You are...you...that is high treason and you have to be killed. </sentence><sentence id="381">Why? </sentence><sentence id="382">On the first of September 19...well, after...after this excitement with having all the people there, these families, and...but they had enough to eat and uh everybody was, of course, preoccupied so again the the the <span class="spatial object">wagons</span> at the <span class="building">railroad station</span> and we knew what they meant and on the lst of September, we were led out from the <span class="populated place">camp</span> to the <span class="building">station</span>. </sentence><sentence id="383">Now that was unforgettable. </sentence><sentence id="384">It was unforgettable because there were some of the old people with us, old ladies, old men, you know, who had not been in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> before who were now being imprisoned. </sentence><sentence id="385">Women, children...children, and the worst of all, the most depressing thing was that there were perhaps ten, twelve cripples, people who had no legs, such cripples, and I...I don't recall having seen them in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> before but it's possible that they had been in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> before, and they were moving on little <span class="spatial object">boards</span> and they had little...little...little wheels, you know, and that's how they were moving forward and I mention them because at the <span class="building">railroad station</span> there was the <span class="building">French Red Cross</span>. </sentence><sentence id="386">They were very kind and very sad. </sentence><sentence id="387">They had...they had an inkling of what...what...what's happening to us. </sentence><sentence id="388">Very sad, very kind...their behavior was contradictory and they had to...to lift these cripples into the <span class="spatial object">freight cars</span>. </sentence><sentence id="389">You see, these cripples couldn't...couldn't walk. </sentence><sentence id="390">They couldn't...and they had to lift them into the <span class="spatial object">freight cars</span> and there was also something else. </sentence><sentence id="391">Nearby was I think the village of <span class="populated place">Vernet</span> and the <span class="building">church</span> bells were ringing, so we went. </sentence><sentence id="392">We were...we were deported to <span class="country">Germany</span> within <span class="spatial object">freight cars</span>. </sentence><sentence id="393">They...we were not...we were not uh like sardines pressured like later on when we went to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> and we were, of course, all the time debating and thinking what does it mean. </sentence><sentence id="394">Uh the Germans are going to send us to work, but why would they take us there. </sentence><sentence id="395">You know, the the the German Jews who have been expelled from <span class="country">Germany</span> in 1940 to Guerres (ph), thousands of them, and now they're taking all the Jews back. </sentence><sentence id="396">What does it mean? </sentence><sentence id="397">Supposed they are going to to have us work. </sentence><sentence id="398">Why do they take children and and and women? </sentence><sentence id="399">Why did they take these cripples? </sentence><sentence id="400">And there was an endless debate and not only a debate among ourselves but I myself started all the time to figure out all the possibilities. </sentence><sentence id="401">There was no...there was no answer, but if they would massacre everybody. </sentence><sentence id="402">Nobody thought of this....not out of question...I mean that they would kill one or the other. </sentence><sentence id="403">They have...we knew they had killed people. </sentence><sentence id="404">They would kill many, yes, but that they would kill all of us or that their practice was to exterminate these people...and I came finally to the conclusion but that was later on, they are establishing a <span class="populated place">Jewish slave state</span> somewhere in the <span class="country">Ukrain</span> and sure they want to have everybody in this slave...you will be slaves. </sentence><sentence id="405">Now uh I managed to send a postcard from the <span class="spatial object">train</span> with the help of a French gendarme to my brother who was in <span class="country">England</span> where I said I am going <span class="building">home</span>, but I really didn't want to, or something to this effect, and see he got the card and it was terribly depressing. </sentence><sentence id="406">After having escaped the Germans, now for years with all the sufferings we had gone through, suddenly everything was in vain. </sentence><sentence id="407">We...we went back. </sentence><sentence id="408">Uh I was with a couple of uh younger persons in the  0 <span class="spatial object">freight car</span>, and we considered breaking out but again the question was, you know, we could have lifted the <span class="spatial object">boards</span>. </sentence><sentence id="409">There was nothing in the <span class="spatial object">freight car</span> but the boards. </sentence><sentence id="410">Uh perhaps you could have lifted them and jumped out and we were...also it was strange the French uh gendarmes, not not the Germans but uh then the question arose . </sentence><sentence id="411">Where are we going? </sentence><sentence id="412">We will be caught again. </sentence><sentence id="413">So after perhaps twenty-four hours, we came to <span class="populated place">Drancy</span> and that's in...and then then _-- <span class="populated place">Drancy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="414"><span class="region">Drancy</span> looked horrible. </sentence><sentence id="415">Drancy consisted of <span class="building">barracks</span> or which had been made for the French police before the war and which could not be occupied because they were wet and badly built, so they stood empty, I guess. </sentence><sentence id="416">I know...I think they stood empty before we came. </sentence><sentence id="417">Not only before we came...before <span class="populated place">Drancy</span> became a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="418">Uh we left incidentally on the Ist...on the 1st of September...the 1st of September of <span class="populated place">Vernet</span>. </sentence><sentence id="419">We were perhaps on the 2nd or the 3rd in <span class="populated place">Drancy</span>, which is in a <span class="populated place">suburb</span> of <span class="populated place">Paris</span>. </sentence><sentence id="420">It was fully of concentra...of uh of of uh <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span>. </sentence><sentence id="421">Of course, we couldn't see the whole thing. </sentence><sentence id="422">We know there were other <span class="region">sections</span>, except the <span class="region">section</span> where we were. </sentence><sentence id="423">We were put into <span class="interior space">rooms</span> which were full of uh rotten straw. </sentence><sentence id="424">It was rotting, you know. </sentence><sentence id="425">It's wet and rotting, and there we were waiting, and, of course, uh uh being very much concerned and preoccupied what's going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="426">It was a morbid situation already you know. </sentence><sentence id="427">Under the rotten straw and with children and uh old people and the complete uh uh the complete helplessness and the complete lack of uh of...we didn't know what's going to happen...to happen to us but we knew, of course, we are now in the clutches of the German and at night we heard sometimes shooting from other parts of the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="428">We didn't know what it means. </sentence><sentence id="429">I remember I | went to one of the <span class="dlf">barbed wires</span> and saw...and tried to see whether I can get...I can get out but it was out of questioning, and then after three or four days there, uh we were ordered to go down...down...we we were <span class="interior space">upstairs</span> I remember. </sentence><sentence id="430">We had to go <span class="interior space">downstairs</span>, you know, to the...to the <span class="dlf">platform</span> and on the <span class="dlf">platform</span> there was already the SS and with...with their customary politeness, shouting and beating and and uh sending us into the...into the <span class="spatial object">railroad cars</span>. </sentence><sentence id="431">Now, the <span class="dlf">French railroads</span> had on every...perhaps they have it to day...I don't think they have it today, but in the 2nd World War, an inscription saying forthe _. </sentence><sentence id="432">That was from the 1st World War and they still have it in the 2nd World War. </sentence><sentence id="433">For the . [ </sentence><sentence id="434">know we were, but I I know this from having read it later on because I didn't know it there, we were...the the <span class="spatial object">transport</span> was transport number 28. </sentence><sentence id="435">It was I think signed by the Chief of the Gestapo in <span class="populated place">Paris</span>, the destination was <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, and we were close to a thousand people, and I know this... didn't know this at that time...because the has...you know who she is...she has found documents all about the <span class="spatial object">transport</span> and the Germans being very German and very meticulous, gave our names, our birthdate and our nationality, so I am on the list of now of the <span class="spatial object">transport</span> number 28. </sentence><sentence id="436">And uh that was signed by the Gestapo in <span class="populated place">Paris</span>. </sentence><sentence id="437">Destination...I think even Eichmann's...Eichmann's name appears in this uh... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="535">Q: Had you been at this point identified as a Jew and were you being deported as a Jew, or was it still as a foreign national? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="537">A: Clear...by this time they knew we were Jews. </sentence><sentence id="538">I mean not only...we knew it before. </sentence><sentence id="539">We were treated like Jews, but not like foreign nationals, and I'll you immediately why we  1 knew this. </sentence><sentence id="540">But we were never told, and I have always said, no Nazi ever now told why I was in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="541">I was never told why I was persecuted by the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="542">I would say...no, they didn't...but they treated us like Jews. </sentence><sentence id="543">I mean they treated us like uh like non-human beings. </sentence><sentence id="544">They beat us and they shouted and uh the worst thing which happened was when I stayed with the <span class="spatial object">French freight cars</span> were for forty...forty men or eight horses. </sentence><sentence id="545">I guess they put in about eighty people. </sentence><sentence id="546">I cannot say how many, but I do know when we were...when we came in, we came into the in the <span class="spatial object">freight</span>, into the <span class="spatial object">freight train</span>, on on the on the side opposite the <span class="dlf">door</span> were little...they're little <span class="dlf">openings</span> and they were with <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span>. </sentence><sentence id="547">You could look out there but not very well. </sentence><sentence id="548">It was pretty dark there, and it...we were so crowded that when you sat down, you couldn't stretch your leg. </sentence><sentence id="549">You...you couldn't move. </sentence><sentence id="550">You you were...you were fixed in this position. </sentence><sentence id="551">There were women, children, old people. </sentence><sentence id="552">They gave us...they gave us and I think they gave us enough bread and apples...apples. </sentence><sentence id="553">But they gave us two <span class="spatial object">buckets</span>. </sentence><sentence id="554">One a <span class="spatial object">bucket</span> for water and the other a <span class="spatial object">bucket</span> for as a toi...using...serving...serving as a <span class="spatial object">toilet</span>, and this bucket serving as a <span class="spatial

seventy, perhaps we were eighty. </sentence><sentence id="556">Perhaps we were ninety. </sentence><sentence id="557">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="558">How could we...that would be horrible. </sentence><sentence id="559">We realized it from the very beginning, and I do remember there was no fear of not having enough food, because you see, uh we had gotten bread and French...and especially those of us who had been in <span class="populated place">Vernet</span> had been hungry, oh there was plenty of bread, apples, and I think even pate, French pate in big...in big...so there was no...we were not...I wasn't afraid of uh of starving, at least at this moment, but...and also with the <span class="env feature">water</span>. </sentence><sentence id="560">I mean how long can water, such water last. </sentence><sentence id="561">And then we are...you asked me about Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="562">I cannot now identify that was clearly we were Jewish, but I do know two things. </sentence><sentence id="563">As we moved into the into the <span class="spatial object">freight car</span>, a young man stepped out of the...out of the of the <span class="dlf">line</span> and shouted to the SS, I am not Jewish, and they talked with him. </sentence><sentence id="564">I don't know what happened uh what happened to him, whether they took him out. </sentence><sentence id="565">There was a second man, and I'll tell you later about him, who was not Jewish but who didn't dare to say who he was and he preferred to be with the Jews and there, of course, when we...I say we were in the <span class="interior space">first floor</span>, <span class="interior space">second floor</span>, and we stepped down to the <span class="dlf">platform</span> and we went on the <span class="dlf">stairs</span>, the French gendarmes tried to take everything away from us, our watches. </sentence><sentence id="566">They said you won't need this anymore. </sentence><sentence id="567">But that was meaningless, only we found that is mean on their part. </sentence><sentence id="568">It is possible, likely even that the SS shouted dirty Jews, but I cannot...I don't recall this. </sentence><sentence id="569">1 mean it was clear now we were Jews, andI mention it. </sentence><sentence id="570">Now started the trip to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, or not quite to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> as you will hear. </sentence><sentence id="571">Uh at the beginning, of course, everybody was depressed and after a couple of hours uh people had to go to the <span class="spatial object">toilet</span> and they couldn't see well, and___ broke out and people shouted at each other. </sentence><sentence id="572">Uh the <span class="env feature">water</span> was soon exhausted. </sentence><sentence id="573">The <span class="env feature">water</span> was also exhausted I I guess because people thought I'd better take advantage. </sentence><sentence id="574">Even if they were not thirsty, they start to drink. </sentence><sentence id="575">I was preoccupied with the idea what's going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="576">I

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="625">A: The only identity...iden...not id...identity, document or identity piece which I had on myself was a military bracelet which...from my military service in <span class="country">France</span> which had a number 7 - 7 - 7. </sentence><sentence id="626">And it...and I I threw away at this point. </sentence><sentence id="627">That's really the point I want to make. </sentence><sentence id="628">I threw it away somehow because I thought it would indicate that I have been in the French army, which was right, but the strange coincidence is that there were three 7's, and here I have four 7's on my...here. ( </sentence><sentence id="629">Cough) So after a couple of hours, pandemonium broke out. </sentence><sentence id="630">People were crying. </sentence><sentence id="631">People were uh shouting, wailing. </sentence><sentence id="632">It was...there was the terrible stench and people always...the <span class="spatial object">train</span> stopped quite often. </sentence><sentence id="633">I remember it stopped once I believe in <span class="populated place">Mintz</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="634"><span class="populated place">Mintz</span>, in in the <span

id="636">And people shouted to to the outside, open the <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="637">We want to so that we throw the the the excrements out and we want water, but the <span class="dlf">doors</span> were not opened. </sentence><sentence id="638">Then we came...there was a little incident. </sentence><sentence id="639">We came into a big <span class="building">railroad station</span> and I believe it was <span class="populated place">Frankfurt</span> or__. </sentence><sentence id="640">It was in a big <span class="populated

object">train</span> took her little girl and and held it up to the little <span class="dlf">window</span> with <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span>, and shouted, water, please, water, please, water. </sentence><sentence id="641">And the Germans...there were...there were fifty in this <span class="dlf">railroad</span>...in this other <span class="spatial object">train</span>, looked at us and they didn't move because they were afraid and I mean there was no satisfaction on their...they could have shouted dirty Jews, which happened later on, but nothing , and suddenly a German woman was running on the <span class="dlf">platform</span> with a <span class="spatial object">container</span> with water and her husband behind her who wanted to restrain her and the soldier went after her and she didn't stop. </sentence><sentence id="642">She wanted to give water to this...to us...to this...to this woman in the <span class="spatial object">train</span>, and then she had to stop. </sentence><sentence id="643">I mean we didn't get any <span class="env feature">water</span>. </sentence><sentence id="644">Then a man came to this <span class="dlf">window</span>, one of the

himself, and he was profuse...profusely bleeding and...but I don't know what he did. </sentence><sentence id="647">Somebody was shooting but he wasn't shooting at him. </sentence><sentence id="648">There were shots outside. </sentence><sentence id="649">He believed, or he shouted he had been...he has been shot. </sentence><sentence id="650">He hadn't been shot. </sentence><sentence id="651">He had scratched himself, so you know, it is...it was a situation which nobody can describe. </sentence><sentence id="652">No Dante...no...it was inferno...inferno, which is indescribable. </sentence><sentence id="653">I read a lot about the Holocaust and apparently there were similar, very similar experiences in other <span class="spatial object">deportation trains</span>, very similar. </sentence><sentence id="654">The crowding, the one <span class="spatial object">bucket</span> for water and for uh for for for excrement as a toi...use a <span class="spatial

id="657">I do not know how long we traveled. </sentence><sentence id="658">It seemed to me four days, but it might have been less...day and night and we didn't know any more whether there was day or night so we had little <span class="dlf">windows</span> but inside in spite of the <span class="dlf">windows</span> it was very...it was very dark. </sentence><sentence id="659">I do not recall that there was hunger. </sentence><sentence id="660">Perhaps people...I don't know...but I mean the the people were thirsty and and and we were...we were already...1 mean some people had the feeling  3 they are trying to kill us there, so suddenly after three, or four or five days...I don't know...the <span class="spatial object">train</span> stopped in an open <span class="dlf">field</span> and we heard shout...shouting...shoutings...everybody...all men between I guess they said fifty and...fifteen and fifty...1 don't know...something like this. </sentence><sentence id="661">Perhaps...yeah, probably...fifteen and fifty...all men between fifteen and fifty, out. </sentence><sentence id="662">Women and children remain inside. </sentence><sentence id="663">Well, we jumped out of the...out of the...out of the <span class="spatial object">wagon</span> and there was...there was a little <span class="dlf">hill</span> and we walked...we we run down the <span class="dlf">hill</span>, and the SS came and and uh and uh uh pushed all the people back, but you see there were some younger people, young men who didn't want to separate from their families. </sentence><sentence id="664">They didn't want to come down, so they tried to get them down and the same woman who had shown her child in the <span class="spatial object">train</span> on the <span class="building">German station</span>, walked out and an SS man came...with the child...and an SS man came and threw the child against the <span class="spatial object">wagon</span> and probably killed the child and shoved the mother back and she carried the child. </sentence><sentence id="665">It was bleeding. </sentence><sentence id="666">She had the child back. </sentence><sentence id="667">And we walked down a little <span class="dlf">slope</span> and suddenly let me go back to the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="668">I really do not recall and cannot really imagine now how...what happened with this one <span class="spatial object">bucket</span> and with this...with this <span class="spatial object">bucket</span> of water. </sentence><sentence id="669">You know, the bucket of water was, of course, empty, but the <span class="spatial object">toilet bucket</span>, I know it was overflowing. </sentence><sentence id="670">There was stench. </sentence><sentence id="671">I must say I personally wouldn't recall that I used it. </sentence><sentence id="672">I don't recall. </sentence><sentence id="673">I don't recall, and there was stench. </sentence><sentence id="674">There was <span class="env feature">dirt</span>. </sentence><sentence id="675">There was...you know, the the excrements were all over. </sentence><sentence id="676">Also, when you're in a lot of stench, you become insensitive to it. </sentence><sentence id="677">You don't...I don't think you you you don't feel it anymore. </sentence><sentence id="678">Uh it was hot. </sentence><sentence id="679">It was depressing. </sentence><sentence id="680">Also physiologically de...depressing. </sentence><sentence id="681">Uh you were not very active, not very alert, but I must say...that's a very good question...I do not really know what people did after the <span class="spatial object">bucket</span>...and I myself...after all, as I say, I think it was between three or five days...I myself don't recall, and after all, after three or five days you have some need to go somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="682">I don't recall. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="741">Q: Would you tell us again now about the <span class="spatial object">train</span> stopping? </sentence><sentence id="742">Where it stopped? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="745">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="746">The <span class="spatial object">train</span> stopped near a little <span class="populated place">town</span> called <span class="populated place">Kozel</span> (ph), which is in <span class="region">Upper Salasia</span> and which is I believe atthe <span class="env feature">__ River</span>. </sentence><sentence id="747">at this time. </sentence><sentence id="748">It stopped in the open <span class="dlf">field</span>. </sentence><sentence id="749">Uh we uh the young...the men capable of work between fifteen and fifty, I believe, were...they were told to get out and all the others to remain inside. </sentence><sentence id="750">There were, of course, people with family who were let's say twenty years old, or thirty years old or husband or wife who didn't want to separate. </sentence><sentence id="751">They were pushed out by the SS and the women and the children and the older people remained in the <span class="spatial object">train</span> and the <span class="spatial object">train</span> then left. </sentence><sentence id="752">We saw it still leaving, after this incident where an SS man threw a child, a little girl against the...against the the <span class="spatial object">train</span>, and we were then uh beaten and shouted at and uh by the SS and after a while, after this went on for a while all of the story with the shoes...I don't know we...I think they wanted to take shoes away...at least they didn't take mine...we were loaded on <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> and we rode to a <span class="populated place">camp</span> which called <span class="populated place">Kozel</span> and this was...this <span class="populated place">Kozel camp</span> was near the <span class="populated place">city</span> of <span class="populated place">Kozel</span>, and you can see it on the map. </sentence><sentence id="753">It can be easily identified. </sentence><sentence id="754"><span class="populated place">Kozel</span> was, as far as I know, a <span class="populated place">transition camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="755">That is to say, out of <span class="populated place">Kozel</span> people were sent into different directions, either to labor or to the gas, but we didn't know about gas. </sentence><sentence id="756">Uh we were there and we were...in the morning we had to go to <span class="building">work</span>. </sentence><sentence id="757">It was heavy work,  4 construction work, on the high....<span class="dlf">highway</span>. </sentence><sentence id="758">It was very important that I speak about this because people think of gas and beating and sickness and starvation, but people were killed by simple work because people were unused...they're not accustomed, many people were not accustomed to working and with us in <span class="populated place">Kozel</span> was a large group of Dutch Jews. </sentence><sentence id="759">They had...we had a uniform at this time, so you could see from their suits, these were middle and upper class people. </sentence><sentence id="760">You know...they had jacket and you could see their hat and how they had lived and how they had dressed at <span class="building">home</span>, and these people were completely incapable of meeting these very rough conditions, both the treatment...the shouting, the beating... and the work. </sentence><sentence id="761">You had...for ten hours we had with the...we had with the <span class="spatial object">shovel</span> and with the what you call the uh... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="779">Q: Pick axe? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="781">A: Pick axe...you had to to loosen the <span class="env feature">ground</span>, and they couldn't do it. </sentence><sentence id="782">I mean I myself had difficulty, the greatest difficulty. </sentence><sentence id="783">Some friends helped me. </sentence><sentence id="784">I couldn't do it the whole day, but they couldn't do it at all so they they stopped working. </sentence><sentence id="785">Uh the the the overseers came and they beat them. </sentence><sentence id="786">The beating worsened their conditions. </sentence><sentence id="787">They fell to the <span class="env feature">ground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="788">Many of them perished there and they perished I would say primarily because they were unable to to do the heavy work. </sentence><sentence id="789">And it's very important to see this aspect of the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="790">It wasn't that they were beaten to death. </sentence><sentence id="791">There were some were beaten to death, but it was the work which finished them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="803">Q: When you say that your friends helped you, can you talk a little bit about that? </sentence><sentence id="804">How did that work? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="807">A: Well, everybody tried to help everybody else. </sentence><sentence id="808">I think you couldn't be an egotist in this situation... mean only concentrate on yourself. </sentence><sentence id="809">You helped your buddy, like he he wasn't a friend in the sense of being a a long...as a result of a long friendship. </sentence><sentence id="810">Everybody tried to help everybody else, if you could. </sentence><sentence id="811">Some people couldn't, but I can tell you later on about . </sentence><sentence id="812">So many people died there and uh I don't know how long we were there. </sentence><sentence id="813">Not long, three days perhaps, and then they formed from the prisoners there, groups and sent them to various places, some probably to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> which we didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="814">Uh we were...we that is to say, we...not all of the people who had come with me, but I...the people with whom I was were put into a strangely enough not a <span class="spatial object">freight car train</span> but a <span class="spatial object">train</span> with <span class="spatial object">passenger cars</span> and as far as I can...as I can uh remember, we went towards <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> but this is constructed afterwards. </sentence><sentence id="815">I think there came other...other <span class="spatial object">cars</span> were were added to our <span class="spatial object">train</span>, and we moved...we...first our <span class="spatial object">train</span> moved first east and we were not far from <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> and perhaps we came very near to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, and then it moved it west to...when I say <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, I mean <span class="populated place">Auschwitz I</span> or <span class="populated place">Birkenau</span>, because there were many <span class="populated place">Auschwitz camps</span>...and then we moved west and now let me tell you very briefly why we moved west. </sentence><sentence id="816">Uh there was a man who came with me from <span class="populated place">Vernet</span>. </sentence><sentence id="817">He had gotten very nice uh stamps and uh...from the outside when we were in <span class="populated place">Vernet</span> and the French uh postal officials always stole his stamps so he asked me to take letters addressed to him and bring them to him personally, so I knew him a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="818">His name was Stanislov  5 Kubacheck (ph), and when the <span class="spatial object">train</span> moved west and we moved to , he was standing next to me and suddenly started to talk to me. </sentence><sentence id="819">He said to me, I am not Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="820">I am a Polish officer, and I cannot say that I am a Polish officer because...you see, he had some confidence in me because I had given him...I had preserved his nice stamps, and if he dared to say that he is a Polish officer, they would take him out and kill him. </sentence><sentence id="821">And he later on...I'll tell you later on...he helped me. </sentence><sentence id="822">He really saved my life twice, so it was Stanislov Kubacheck and then we...the <span class="spatial object">train</span> went west and we came to a <span class="populated place">camp</span> called <span class="populated place">Lauerhutte</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="823">Now <span class="building">Lauerhutte</span>...you know what a <span class="building">hutte</span> is...a <span class="building">hutte</span> in German is a combination between a <span class="dlf">mine</span> and a <span class="spatial object">blast furnace</span>. </sentence><sentence id="824">In <span class="region">Upper Salasia</span> it was full of heavy industry and <span class="building">Lauerhutte</span> was one of those <span class="building">huttes</span> where you had blasted <span class="spatial object">furnaces</span> and where you had...I don't know whether there was a <span class="dlf">coal mine</span> or not. </sentence><sentence id="825"><span class="populated place">Lauerhutte</span> which is the German name is...was part of a big <span class="populated place">city</span> called...a relatively big <span class="populated place">industrial city</span> called in German Hindenburg (ph) after Hindenburg, and I know it was called in Polish , and it's a combination of many industrial smaller <span class="populated place">towns</span> in <span class="building">Lauerhutte</span>. </sentence><sentence id="826"><span class="populated place">Lauerhutte</span> was a...had several old <span class="spatial object">blast furnaces</span> and they installed in the <span class="building">factory</span> in this <span class="populated place">Lauerhutte</span>, the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>...I don't know how many were there, there were perhaps five hundred or eight hundred people there. </sentence><sentence id="827">We were sleeping in big <span class="interior space">rooms</span> where there had been <span class="spatial object">boilers</span> before and we...the the <span class="populated place">camp</span> or the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> was in this <span class="building">factory</span>, so we didn't have far to go. </sentence><sentence id="828">We went from the...from where we slept through a little <span class="dlf">door</span> into the pla...to the place where we worked. </sentence><sentence id="829">It was very strange that we were guarded by a group which looked like SR...not SS...SR or organization ____. </sentence><sentence id="830">They were very rude. </sentence><sentence id="831">They were elderly people. </sentence><sentence id="832">They were very rude. </sentence><sentence id="833">They beat us, but the supervision of this <span class="populated place">camp</span> was the SS and uh I must say I'm...I have been never clear and I am still not clear about <span class="populated place">Auschwitz I</span>, <span class="populated place">Auschwitz II</span>, <span class="populated place">Auschwitz III</span>. </sentence><sentence id="834">This was an outcamp of <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, but I didn't know about it and it was not guarded by the SS or the SS was uh was supervising uh the...our supervision, the old guard and once there was a big scandal. </sentence><sentence id="835">Those who guarded us were accused of having had some deals with some Jews from <span class="populated place">Antwerp</span> who had brought diamonds into the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, and the SS arrested our guards, but they arrested other guards which were not SS. </sentence><sentence id="836">In <span class="populated place">Lauerhutte</span>...whatever the the Polish name I don't know...the work was very, very, very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="837">I remember when they assigned together...I was assigned to this...we were dismantling one of the old <span class="spatial object">blast furnaces</span> and we were carrying heavy pieces of wood which had been in this <span class="spatial object">blast furnace</span>...in this...in the install...installation of this blast <span class="spatial object">furnace</span>, and, you know, that was so heavy that uh perhaps eight men...uh we had iron iron uh sticks or bars and we had...eight men had to carry this, but some of them were very...of us were very weak from the beginning, and if one cou...there were perhaps four couples. </sentence><sentence id="838">If one couple releases or didn't didn't carry enough, the others couldn't and the whole thing fell down and injured people. </sentence><sentence id="839">It was hea...and and when we couldn't...when we couldn't lift it, we were beaten and one of the things from the <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span> which I have never understood...sometimes people have been beaten with iron bars, and they would think they have been injured. </sentence><sentence id="840">Sometimes they were injured. </sentence><sentence id="841">Sometimes they were killed, but sometimes...I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="842">It fell in a way where nothing happened, so we were badly beaten and we were beaten to lift this thing and we couldn't lift it and people were laying on the <span class="interior space">floor</span> uh and couldn't walk anymore. </sentence><sentence id="843">Uh that was the first month in <span class="populated place">Lauerhutte</span>. </sentence><sentence id="844">We  6 came there sometimes in the middle of September. </sentence><sentence id="845">We left uh <span class="populated place">Paris</span>, <span class="populated place">Drancy</span>, the first of September and we came there around the middle of September. </sentence><sentence id="846">By the beginning of November, about one third, all the Dutch were gone. </sentence><sentence id="847">All the Dutch who had...didn't survive <span class="populated place">Kozel</span>, had died. </sentence><sentence id="848">And the people who died and every day people died, the people who died...we were in this big <span class="interior space">room</span> where there had been <span class="spatial object">boilers</span> before, a <span class="interior space">boiler room</span>...and there were...there were <span class="spatial object">bunker beds</span>...<span class="spatial object">beds</span>, you know, uh <span class="spatial object">three story beds</span>, and behind us there was some straw and the Dutch people were always around into the <span class="env feature">straw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="849">The next day they were carried out in one <span class="spatial object">coffin</span>...one <span class="spatial object">coffin</span>, and there was a a team (ph) which didn't do anything else but the whole day they they they carried the dead people out and uh and as I said, by November I guess one third of the people had died, and new people came in. </sentence><sentence id="850">Uh at this time, before this happened, I was once ordered to go by <span class="spatial object">truck</span> to the <span class="building">station</span>...now I don't know whether whether <span class="populated place">Lauerhutte</span> had a <span class="building">station</span> or whether it was , to a <span class="building">station</span> and I was sitting with another buddy, with another inmate, next to the driver and in the back there were perhaps thirty or forty uh <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> inmates uh who had been all sick. </sentence><sentence id="851">They came from the <span class="dlf">sick bay</span>, and when we came to the <span class="building">station</span>, they had to undress naked and were pushed into a <span class="spatial object">freight car</span> and the reason why I and my buddy had to come along because we had to take their clothes and bring it back and they probably went to to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> to the gas, you know. </sentence><sentence id="852">We were in <span class="populated place">AuscHwitz</span> and they went to the <span class="interior space">gas chambers</span>. </sentence><sentence id="853">I don't know at what time we started to realize that there are <span class="interior space">gas chambers</span>, but we didn't understand this...we identified <span class="interior space">gas chambers</span> with <span class="building">crematoria</span> and I think since we were people from...coming from the <span class="region">west</span>, the knowledge of what really happened was given to us by Jews from <span class="country">Poland</span> and from the __ [remember there was a group of Jews from , and they knew what happened, but they couldn't explain it either. </sentence><sentence id="854">Frankly, nobody knew about gas...I mean now it seems strange not to know about it, but I don't think we understood it. </sentence><sentence id="855">We knew about <span class="building">crematoria</span> and you know, you didn't follow...develop your ideas since we know what happened...how the person killed in the <span class="building">crematorium</span>...if he burned. </sentence><sentence id="856">We didn't follow the...the <span class="building">crematoria</span>, that was the place where people were killed, and we didn't go further and this incident which I told you about with people being sent naked, that was clearly a case, an instance where people were sent to death, but I must say it took a long time until I and I think all the others started to realize that we are condemned to dea...to die and all pe...all Jews are condemned to die. </sentence><sentence id="857">For some time we believed the Germans are crazy and just killed people but that everybody is to be killed, that we didn't understand . </sentence><sentence id="858">Now on a personal note, around this time I once came in front of a <span class="spatial object">mirror</span>, and I saw what was called a <span class="spatial object">mussulman</span>. </sentence><sentence id="859">You know what a mussulman was...somebody who was so emaciated was about to die. </sentence><sentence id="860">That was the last stage when people died, and I was struck by what I saw, myself, and outside this place where I saw myself there was a <span class="spatial object">garbage can</span>, and I looked into the <span class="spatial object">garbage can</span> and there was a book and the book contained the text of of songs by Shubert (ph) and you might know there is one song by Shubert, the Austrian composer, the death and the maiden and the death says to the maiden, don't be afraid. </sentence><sentence id="861">You are not going to suffer. </sentence><sentence id="862">You will sleep in my <span class="spatial object">arms</span>, and that uh encouraged me very much because I said to myself OK, if I have to die, it will be sleeping. </sentence><sentence id="863">If I die, I don't have to be afraid and I wasn't afraid, and that was a very experience. </sentence><sentence id="864">Shortly thereafter I was so weak that I asked for sick leave. </sentence><sentence id="865">Now you  7 could ask for sick leave...sick leave...you could ask not to go to <span class="building">work</span> for one day but it was very dangerous because when you came to the <span class="dlf">sick bay</span> and then you went... . </sentence><sentence id="866">Lwas so weak I stayed in <span class="spatial object">bed</span> andI didn't want to go. </sentence><sentence id="867">I was what happened. </sentence><sentence id="868">I couldn't anymore and this Stanislov Kubacheck, this Polish officer who had become a kapo, helped me. </sentence><sentence id="869">In the first place, the <span class="building">kapo</span> has...had to...had to watch whether his people got one ration...got their food, and he had to watch others that they don't don't come twice and take food twice, so he allowed me to go twice. </sentence><sentence id="870">I was the first and came the last one. </sentence><sentence id="871">Then he took me to his commander in his team and I didn't have to work, so I recovered and I must say amongst the many circumstances why I survived, that was one, but it's only one because there were thousands other dangers which I was exposed to and that's then another story. </sentence><sentence id="872">Uh I must say from <span class="populated place">Lauerhutte</span> we also were sent to work in combination. </sentence><sentence id="873">I don't remember where the <span class="dlf">mines</span> were. </sentence><sentence id="874">Perhaps there were no <span class="dlf">mines</span> anymore, only the <span class="spatial object">blast furnaces</span>, and I worked in where we had to...where we had to to dig the founda...the foundations for a new <span class="spatial object">blast furnace</span> in order to which al...which is also near there and all these names are very long, as longas____--s German. </sentence><sentence id="875">Now today all this is Polish. </sentence><sentence id="876">I must say that there also...I know that there are <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span> in or in in I have read...I have read a great lot about uh the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="877">Never read anything, heard anything about these <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span> and I know some of these <span class="populated place">camps</span> disappeared from the surface of the <span class="env feature">earth</span> when people disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="878">They were perhaps buried. </sentence><sentence id="879">There must be plenty of places in <span class="country">Poland</span> or in this <span class="region">area</span> where there are <span class="dlf">mass graves</span> and never been who is there, who was buried there. </sentence><sentence id="880">Uh I want to mention two things. </sentence><sentence id="881">Now when we worked or in <span class="populated place">Lauerhutte</span> , we had to march there from the <span class="populated place">camp</span> in which we were, <span class="populated place">Lauerhutte</span>. </sentence><sentence id="882">One day we saw British prisoners of war passing us and shouting at us and it turned out these were Jewish soldiers who had volunteered from <span class="country">Palestine</span> into the Bristish army, had been taken prisoner by the German. </sentence><sentence id="883">They were threatened to be sent to a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> until the British government told them, told the German that if they are not treated like British...British soldiers, the British will take retaliatory measures, so the Germans separated them but treated them like prisoners of war according to the Geneva Convention. </sentence><sentence id="884">They knew we were marching till the next day in the evening so when the pass us, they threw us packages. </sentence><sentence id="885">The other thing I want to mention is we had to march through the <span class="populated place">city</span> of when we marched to these places, to these <span class="building">work places</span>, and one day we were attacked by the...by the Hitler youths. </sentence><sentence id="886">You know, we were marching there and were attacked by the Hitler youths...dirty Jews, Jews, Jews, Jews. </sentence><sentence id="887">And the SS...there was SS...now how was SS there? </sentence><sentence id="888">There was <span class="building">SS</span>. </sentence><sentence

SS. </sentence><sentence id="892">The SS considered us their prisoners and nobody was supposed to do us anything, so they started to fight the Hitler youth. </sentence><sentence id="893">Uh with there, I was in <span class="populated place">Lauerhutte</span> until the year 1943. </sentence><sentence id="894">Work was very hard. </sentence><sentence id="895">Food was insufficient. </sentence><sentence id="896">Uh people died from exhaustion or because they were beaten to death. </sentence><sentence id="897">There is also this which I have to say and this was much more...more more permanent and later on in the other <span class="populated place">camp</span> I have been...you know, when the...when...when the war...when we had to march into the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, many people were sick or dying or injured and we had to the extent possible, we had to to drag them so all these marches looked like uh...how should I say...I mean, it was not...it was supernatural what you could see,  8 what and it was very difficult to help people back. </sentence><sentence id="898">And from time to time there were selections, particularly these prisoners were sent out because they couldn't work but we didn't quite understand why that was. </sentence><sentence id="899">Uh but we did understand because I want to say now at the end of our stay in in <span class="populated place">Lauerhutte</span>, we had a very good Polish master. </sentence><sentence id="900">We worked in a <span class="building">factory</span> under German masters or Polish masters and we were watched and guarded by by these uh SR or whatever they were, and it was known that we would uh be transferred and he thought we would be sent to the gas and so he was very kind and sad. </sentence><sentence id="901">He gave us cigarettes and then one day we were...we were transferred in August of 1943 and we went to <span class="populated place">Blechhammer</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="902">Now <span class="populated place">Lauerhutte</span> was a small <span class="populated place">camp</span> and it was an outside <span class="populated place">camp</span>

id="1062">Some people...I I had an old...a can, a can and I just...I could get my soup, and I also had...I don't know from  9 where I had it...a spoon, but there were people who had nothing of this, so they would get their food in a big washing...wash dish for let's say six people, and now imagine how can you get your food...how can you fish out part of the soup and the potatoes...there were potatoes in it...if you have no instrument, you know, utensil to take it out. </sentence><sentence id="1063">These people quarreled, didn't get what was their due, and uh many of them died of course. </sentence><sentence id="1064">Uh we worked...we were in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> and we got up in the summer at five o'clock...no, in the summer at four or three o'clock. </sentence><sentence id="1065">In the winter later and we worked from six in the morning to six in the evening, twelve hours. </sentence><sentence id="1066">We worked on various jobs and the type of job you had depended...determined very much your your your fate because if you had a heavy job, it was exhausting and you were exposed to beatings. </sentence><sentence id="1067">If you had a relatively light job, you were exempt from this. </sentence><sentence id="1068">You were not exposed to this and I must say in <span class="populated place">Blechhammer</span> I worked on construction

were...all the <span class="dlf">windows</span> were broken from bombings and so we had to fit in uh cardboards where the the glass had been. </sentence><sentence id="1069">I must tell you that <span class="building">Blechhammer</span> was one of the <span class="building">German factories</span> where oil, petrol, gasoline was derived from coal. </sentence><sentence id="1070">It was one of the most important <span class="building">German factories</span> and there were a few of such <span class="building">factories</span> in <span class="region">Bohemia</span>, in <span class="region">central Germany</span>, and there, and at the end when the Germans lost uh <span class="dlf">Romanian oil fields</span>, they were of of utmost strategic importance and I'll tell you later on about the bombing. </sentence><sentence id="1071">Uh how should I systematize <span class="building">Blechhammer</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1072">I've told you about uh there being various nationalities, and uh we had to walk about two, three miles...no, two, three kilometers to the <span class="building">factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1073">We had to get up very, very early. </sentence><sentence id="1074">Uh the <span class="building">factory</span> employed twenty-five thousand people. </sentence><sentence id="1075">Among them were five thousand Germans who were free workers, a small number of French and Czech workers who were free workers who were only obliged to work there, and a great number of slaves of uh various degrees, prisoners of war, English prisoners of war, French prisoners of war, Yugoslav prisoners of war and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1076">Uh so in the morning, you could...it was an incredible picture. </sentence><sentence id="1077">You could see...it was still dark...you could see from all sides the people marching towards the <span class="building">factory</span> and uh we were surrounded on both sides by the SS which had like long whips with which their...and machine guns uh and uh in the morning we had the appell...the the the what you call the roll call in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="1078">If somebody felt sick during the the appell, he was already counted, they tried to force him to march out with us, so we had to drag him out. </sentence><sentence id="1079">When we left the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, the music was playing. </sentence><sentence id="1080">When we came back the music was playing. </sentence><sentence id="1081">They were inmates, the musicians. </sentence><sentence id="1082">Uh now I want to tell you one story which was important...important...___ spoke recently here of the hidden children. </sentence><sentence id="1083">The head of the <span class="populated place">camp,</span> the Jewish head of the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, the lageraltester he was called, was Mr. Demera (ph) who had managed to bring a five year old child, his son, into the <span class="populated place">camp</span> and he was afraid that his son would taken...would be taken away from him and sent to the gas. </sentence><sentence id="1084">Now the Polish Jews had learned that each SS occupied a <span class="populated place">village</span>, a <span class="populated place">Jewish village</span> or a <span class="populated place">Jewish place</span>, and would divide the population into two groups, women and old people and children on one side and men on the other side, men being expected to work. </sentence><sentence id="1085">And after they had learned this, uh they did the following. </sentence><sentence id="1086">They tried to hide boys, not girls, boys among the men in the group where the men were standing and it so happened that in the course of time, more and more children came into the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1087">I think at the end...not at the  0 end...at the point which I am now talking about...there were some thirty children and Demera, the lageraltester, the head of the of the <span class="populated place">camp,</span> the Jewish head of the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, was afraid that his child and his children who were badly...who were well treated, they had enough to eat...the Germans gave them enough to eat, but that they would would be gassed, so he persuaded...uh he told the SS look...we have the children. </sentence><sentence id="1088">They're not working. </sentence><sentence id="1089">I mean they're parasites. </sentence><sentence id="1090">We need to have children, the children work. </sentence><sentence id="1091">And a <span class="spatial object">column</span> was created, a <span class="spatial object">kommando</span> was created, consisting only of children. </sentence><sentence id="1092">The kapo was Mr. Klepich (ph) from <span class="populated place">Paris</span>, the deputy kapo was Mr. Bornstein (ph) from <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>...I knew them well...I happened to know them well...and for some reason which I cannot recall, I had...1 was thrown out of my kommando. </sentence><sentence id="1093">It was a bad work...I don't know what I did, and nobody wants to have me in his <span class="spatial object">kommando</span>, so being during the roll call pushed from one...one <span class="spatial object">kommando</span> to the other, I landed at the children's kommando which had the first day...which was...had it's first day, and since I knew that the the the kapo and his deputy, they took me in. </sentence><sentence id="1094">I don't know what right they had to take me in but I had somebody else to throw me out or push me out from their kommando. </sentence><sentence id="1095">I was with the children's kommando, and so we walked on this day...that was in October 1943..-with the children to work. </sentence><sentence id="1096">Now the children...the SS on both sides with its sticks and with whips and its machine guns and all the five thousand people in this __ this way and the thirty children. </sentence><sentence id="1097">Now when we met the other prisoners, the French prisoners, the British prisoners, everybody started to shout and to to whistle and to call shame on the Germans and the SS itself was embarrassed and they did react, so we walked with the children to our assigned <span class="populated place">working place</span> and there somebody uh uh a <span class="spatial object">kapo</span> appeared and said the children have to do the following. </sentence><sentence id="1098">There are stones on this side of the <span class="dlf">road</span> and they have to bring the stones to the other side of the <span class="dlf">road</span>, and he disappeared and we were alone. </sentence><sentence id="1099">And some of the children started to work and took the stones and brought them to the other side and other children knew that they were in <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1100">They were between six and twelve years old. </sentence><sentence id="1101">Whatever the little boy and a charming little boy called Malich (ph) and he didn't recognize that he was in a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1102">He wanted to play, so when we came to this place and the other children were...brought stones from one side to the other, he played. </sentence><sentence id="1103">He played. </sentence><sentence id="1104">He had...there was a broken down <span class="spatial object">machine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1105">It was a <span class="spatial object">plane</span> or something...a <span class="spatial object">steam engine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1106">He played there, and suddenly there came a young SS man whom I had never seen and he liked this boy and he started to play with Malich and then he started to carve out of wood which was laying around, little things which he...little toys and gave it to to <span class="populated place">Malich</span> and then he said to me, isn't it a pity. </sentence><sentence id="1107">Such a nice boy, but he is Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1108">He must die. </sentence><sentence id="1109">Now the <span class="spatial object">children's column</span> had no tragic end I have to say. </sentence><sentence id="1110">After a while the children gave up carrying the stone. </sentence><sentence id="1111">The whole thing was was meaningless and they were staying around there, but it was October. </sentence><sentence id="1112">It became...it was very, very cold. </sentence><sentence id="1113">It became colder and colder and uh we didn't know what to do with ourselves and with the children and I remember they they were singing and they were singing two songs. </sentence><sentence id="1114">One of the which is their <span class="building">home</span>, and another song about <span class="populated place">Treblinka</span> (ph), <span class="populated place">Treblinka</span> being a place where people are burned. </sentence><sentence id="1115">Now the children survived until until the marches at the end of the...of my stay in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> and then uh they went on the marches. </sentence><sentence id="1116">Whether they have survived or how many of them have survived, I don't know but I do know of five thousand people marching out, very very  1 few have survived. </sentence><sentence id="1117">I mean of the five thousand...I don't know what happened to the children, but nothing happened to them. </sentence><sentence id="1118">The the the kommando was dissolved again.(drinking) Now I want to tell you the story about the <span class="building">gallows</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1119">The SS beat people. </sentence><sentence id="1120">The SS uh could take uh a stick or something, an <span class="spatial object">iron bar</span> and hit somebody and kill him. </sentence><sentence id="1121">Nothing happened. </sentence><sentence id="1122">They were not called. </sentence><sentence id="1123">They were not in any way responsible, but there was a very strange thing. </sentence><sentence id="1124">The one...they hanged somebody and erected a <span class="spatial object">gallow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1125">A person was hanged upon order of the chief of the...no...the furher of the SS and chief of the German police. </sentence><sentence id="1126">Furher of the SS and chief , and when somebody was hanged, there was a sentence and this sentence had to be...had to be read and it was illegal to hang somebody without the sentence because there was uh German justice, so you you could be killed or murdered in any way possible but hanging...there was a gallow and uh everybody was called...everybody...the the whole the whole the whole...all the inmates had to assemble and then the per...then the number was called out and it was said why the person was hanged, but always upon

</sentence><sentence id="1133">The public hanging uh was staged in such a way that everybody was deeply, deeply afraid although he knew he was not being hanged, but here, part of...part of yourself was hanged. </sentence><sentence id="1134">boy whom I remember...not a boy. </sentence><sentence id="1135">He was a young man by the name of Johnson. </sentence><sentence id="1136">He was a Dutch man.
