that I have written previously, I wrote down the date as being December 7. </sentence><sentence id="454">I did that to cover <span class="populated place">Sanspritz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="455">I did that because I wanted to protect him and he needed 10 days, about 10 days more than necessary so that I could protect him. </sentence><sentence id="456">But now I have chosen to tell the truth. </sentence><sentence id="457">However, I can't give you any more details now, because I first have to speak with the Spanish Ambassador. </sentence><sentence id="458">I will speak with him

</sentence><sentence id="462">Anyway, that day...uh...either the last day of November or the first day of December and I don't remember exactly which one, Sanspritz, who is a diplomat, a career diplomat left. </sentence><sentence id="463">And so I was trying to decide what to do. </sentence><sentence id="464">I'd heard by the way that he'd left at about 6:00 AM...uh...through a phone call and I don't remember if it was him...if he personally who called me or someone else, a legal attache or what. </sentence><sentence id="465">But anyway, I learned that he was...that he'd left. </sentence><sentence id="466">And so I took a walk around the <span class="populated place">international ghetto</span> wondering what I could do and I found myself in <span class="dlf">Lagradi Corroli Street</span>, and I saw that this <span class="building">building</span> was being occupied by the police, so I entered the <span class="building">building</span> and asked what was happening and saw that there were people with <span class="spatial object">suitcases</span>, a few <span class="spatial object">suitcases</span> and...uh...the people, the Jews in the <span class="building">house</span> told me that the police want...wanted to take them away. </sentence><sentence id="467">So I decided to lock the <span class="dlf">door</span> and...uh...L...I went to see the lieutenant and I asked him what was happening and I told him that he couldn't do this because the <span class="building">house</span> is being protected...uh...by the Spaniards and he needed my permission, and I was surprised at his behavior since he was part of the regular <span class="building">police forces</span>. </sentence><sentence id="468">He was not a <span

we went to a <span class="dlf">park</span> where we met with these members who belonged to a committee which have representatives from police force, <span class="building">Ministry of Interior</span>, Foreign Affairs, and I protested what was happening and someone told me that the...that they had heard that the Spanish representative had fled the <span class="populated place">city</span> and so there was no more relations with the Spanish Government. </sentence><sentence id="471">I told him that he was wrong and that the Spanish had not fled but that he'd went to <span

</sentence><sentence id="1170">The first few days of January we heard some rumors according to which it seemed that they wanted to take away all of the Jews from the <span class="populated

they were saying that Minister who was in charge of the civilians and military for the seized (ph) <span class="populated place">capital</span>, they were saying that he was going to burn the <span

</sentence><sentence id="1173">In the meantime new letters were being issued, not very many but there was always someone who felt threatened because they had inspected the <span

fourth...on the fourth or fifth or the sixth of January...I don't remember exactly...probably the fifth or the sixth of January, I was crossing <span class="dlf">Mussolini Square</span> to go to the <span class="building">orphanages</span> which were very nearby and I saw a column of Jews passing by and so I asked, who are these Jews? </sentence><sentence id="1175">And they say, these are Jews, uh Portuguese Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1176">That night, during that during the night the Portuguese minister had sent an employee of his to ask me orally to assume the responsibility for the <span class="building">Portuguese Legation</span> and I told him no, that if there is something, if there is something...if he can come and explain to me, then we can come to an agreement, but as it stands I I didn't...1 couldn't assume any more responsibilities. </sentence><sentence id="1177">I'd had enough of my own, and so I saw that they took away all those Portuguese Jews and so I understood that that had already, man had already abandoned everything or he was about to abandon everything because he was the Portuguese minister but he was a Hungarian citizen. </sentence><sentence id="1178">He was the : was his name, but he was a Hungarian citizen, but he was acting as Portuguese minister and therefore that man said he had abandoned everything, that he was stepping back and that he considered uh that he couldn't do anything more. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1179">So I wrote a letter to this minister and I...where I wrote that I had heard these rumors, that I didn't believe in them, that please to deny these rumors but he didn't respond and after two days I wrote him....actually no...I telephoned and I said that I was about to come to see him...that I would come see him the next day and I think that was January 8 or the 7th or the 8th of January. </sentence><sentence id="1180">Probably the 8th. </sentence><sentence id="1181">Perhaps even in the night.

was lost. </sentence><sentence id="1194">He'd been compromised because of the Jewish question and so he killed himself. </sentence><sentence id="1195">Sada (ph) was his name. </sentence><sentence id="1196">Colonel Sada and he was the head of the whole <span class="building">gendarmerie</span> of <span class="country">Hungary</span> at that time, so I went to this minister that I had seen, not known, but I had seen him in the past and very calmly he said yes. </sentence><sentence id="1197">He wanted to solve the Jewish question by killing everyone. </sentence><sentence id="1198">And so I started to say do you realize what's happening and do you realize what's going to happen, that the Hungarian people will have to suffer because you killed a hundred thousand people, and so finally I even...you know...I even talked about the Myian (ph) civilization and everything that came to mind, ___ people...anything to move him. </sentence><sentence id="1199">I even cried. </sentence><sentence id="1200">Uh but he was tough so I didn't know what to do anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1201">I, I can't just leave the situation like this, I thought to myself, so I told him, look...if within forty-five hours the Spanish government does not receive from me a guarantee that all is calm and that the agreements between...the agreements with the Hungarian government have been respected because during the period between October, November and December we had come to an agreement with the Foreign Affairs Minister and the Hungarian government...we had reached an agreement and received guarantees. </sentence><sentence id="1202">Not only that but the Hungarian government wanted to send a diplomatic representative to <span class="populated place">Madrid</span> in order to, to tie diplomatic relations with the Anglo-Americans to see in, in, in view of the peace treaty, and logically the Spanish government who didn't wish to recognize the Nazi government, didn't want to hear anything about it. </sentence><sentence id="1203">The, the uh credentials, the request for credentials...he's explaining uh this...what credentials are...logically I didn't transmit these letters of...this request for credentials to <span class="populated place">Madrid</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1204">It was for a certain Colonel . </sentence><sentence id="1205">I didn't transmit them because if I did the Spanish government would probably say that that they that they didn't accept it because they didn't recognize the government while until then the government, the Spanish government kept quiet. </sentence><sentence id="1206">They kept quiet. </sentence><sentence id="1207">Also the Spanish uh Spanish ambassador last night told me that he saw in the archives many telegrams from the Hungarian government which asked the Spanish government if I was really the charge d'affaires. </sentence><sentence id="1208">The Spanish government never answered. </sentence><sentence id="1209">The Spanish ambassador told me that last night. </sentence><sentence id="1210">They never...the Spanish government never responded to these telegrams. </sentence><sentence id="1211">I understood naturally, slowly...I slowly understood why we had a preferential treatment with the Hungarian government and this was because they wanted to have diplomatic relations with <span class="country">Spain</span> to contact the Anglo-Americans. </sentence><sentence id="1212">We understood it late, but we understood it. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1213">If we understood it immediately, maybe two months earlier because we're already talking about the beginning of November...had we understood it earlier, two months ago, we would have behaved differently and perhaps something more could have been done I think but uh we're not...we weren't that intelligent after all. </sentence><sentence id="1214">The Spanish ambassador told me not that...not everyone is intelligent. </sentence><sentence id="1215">I wasn't intelligent. </sentence><sentence id="1216">The other the other guy also wasn't intelligent so uh what do you want. </sentence><sentence id="1217">So I told him that if within forty-five hours the Spanish government doesn't get any guarantees that everything is proceeding with order the three thousand Hungarian citizens which are, who are in, in <span class="country">Spain</span> will be interned...actually there were really a hundred including the diplomats...and their goods will be seized and this, the Spanish government will...or ask the Brazilian government and the Paraguayan government to do the same with those Hungarian citizens who were in <span class="country">Brazil</span> and <span

are friends. </sentence><sentence id="1228">We're friends if you say, if you do what we want. </sentence><sentence id="1229">To sum it up he said, OK. </sentence><sentence id="1230">The Spaniards are, are excluded from the liquidation, will be excluded from the liquidation and so I said no, and I became uh demanding in that moment. </sentence><sentence id="1231">I said no. </sentence><sentence

<span class="populated place">ghetto</span> must be, must have electricity and water, so forth again, because those people have to survive too because what would what would happen of the Hungarian

forth and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1234">And so we agreed that everything would have uh occurred in that way. </sentence><sentence id="1235">When I left the <span class="building">office</span> I found <span class="populated place">Wallenberg</span> and were still there, and I explained the situation to them and I said I was able to obtain this and that. </sentence><sentence id="1236">When you do inside I don't know what you can ask of this minister, but please don't uh do anything to undermine this agreement that we've just come to. </sentence><sentence id="1237">Otherwise nothing

the more I saw the more | told myself how is it possible that I, I let them go, and so I told these kids, you see that <span class="spatial object">car</span> over there. </sentence><sentence id="1525">Get in the <span class="spatial object">car</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1526">Run to the <span class="spatial object">car</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1527">Get into the <span class="spatial object">car</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1528">Close the <span class="dlf">door</span> and then the chauffeur will know what he has to do. </sentence><sentence id="1529">Maybe you would like to hear from me how I could communicate with these people. </sentence><sentence id="1530">At the time I spoke German, French, Spanish, but I could explain myself, I could express myself in Hungarian for a little bit and perhaps I spoke Hungarian with these children, but anyhow these kids went. </sentence><sentence id="1531">One Gestapo major came to and he wanted the kids back, and I said no. </sentence><sentence id="1532">They were in the <span class="spatial object">car</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1533">It's a <span class="spatial object">Spanish car</span> and it had a Spanish uh flag and a license plate, diplomatic license plates and therefore the <span class="spatial object">car</span> was extra(c)territorial property. </sentence><sentence id="1534">He insisted. </sentence><sentence id="1535">He took out his gun and then so forth, and next, Wallenberg was next to me and Wallenberg said...told the major, the German major, look...this man represents <span class="country">Spain</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1536">You can't...you can't commit any violent acts. </sentence><sentence id="1537">He said look. </sentence><sentence id="1538">He's getting in the way of my work, and instinctively I replied that you call this work. </sentence><sentence id="1539">That's what I asked him. </sentence><sentence id="1540">And so he got even more angry. </sentence><sentence id="1541">He wanted the kids back. </sentence><sentence id="1542">And L...at that point I saw the situation getting really bad. </sentence><sentence id="1543">I thought my God, this man is crazy. </sentence><sentence id="1544">He could shoot us. </sentence><sentence id="1545">He had a big gun, a <span class="spatial object">Mauthauser</span> (ph), a big, big gun, but at that point...we were all yelling. </sentence><sentence id="1546">I was screaming. </sentence><sentence id="1547">Wallenberg, the Spaniard...sorry...the Portuguese, the Swiss, the <span class="building">Vatican</span>...everyone intervened in the discussion. </sentence><sentence id="1548">There were many loud voices at the same time and so this colonel, a colonel came, an SS colonel came...of the Gestapo...sorry...came to see what was happening and he asked the major what was happening and the major explained it to him, and so he said now let it be...their time will come too for the kids. </sentence><sentence id="1549">And so they left. </sentence><sentence id="1550">And then I brought these kids <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1551">I brought them to the <span class="building">Legation</span> and I was surprised to see that they were really a boy and a girl who when they were fully dressed you couldn't tell and they...it was a boy and a girl and they were perfectly identical. </sentence><sentence id="1552">The same height, the same face...everything, everything was identical. </sentence><sentence id="1553">This is an episode that struck me which, which along with the other episode of the child who was killed on the <span class="dlf">street</span>, these two episodes made me reflect very much. </sentence><sentence id="1554">It's not that...at the time I really wasn't fully aware of the situation. </sentence><sentence id="1555">From the end of March to October 13th, I was not...I had been interned away from <span class="populated place">Budapest</span> in the <span class="region">countryside</span>...I continued my work. </sentence><sentence id="1556">I stopped looking for the three hundred people because I got one hundred and fifty back and it seemed have understood that This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1557">It is not the primary source, and it has not

that could be done and so I started to organize the protection network. </sentence><sentence id="1559">We had a <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1560">I don't remember where it was. ( </sentence><sentence id="1561">Technical conversation) I don't remember which one it was but we did have one <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1562">Maybe two <span class="building">houses</span> we had already. </sentence><sentence id="1563">Maybe they were _ wherever Long was...yes, it's perhaps...but anyway that's not important. </sentence><sentence id="1564">I started organizing by issuing hundreds of letters immediately. </sentence><sentence id="1565">Letters of protection and I would...I would let these people come in. </sentence><sentence id="1566">We would go to the <span class="building">office</span> and type up these letters. </sentence><sentence id="1567">Sanspritz didn't know anything because we used his <span class="spatial object">signature pad</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1568">He didn't know how many. </sentence><sentence id="1569">His job was to keep relations with the Foreign Affairs Minister. </sentence><sentence id="1570">So we issued I think more than two thousand five hundred protection...letters of protection in the month of...at the end of October and November. </sentence><sentence id="1571">To be more specific...1 couldn't be more specific than that. </sentence><sentence id="1572">I think we maybe reached three thousand, more or less. </sentence><sentence id="1573">It wasn't very easy. </sentence><sentence id="1574">Not only...it wasn't sufficient to issue a letter of protection and to escort these people to their <span class="building">house</span> because they had to be escorted to a <span class="building">building</span> after all. </sentence><sentence id="1575">I had some people who were willing to accompany these people with their <span class="spatial object">cars</span> uh as the letters of protection were issued. </sentence><sentence id="1576">There were <span class="spatial object">cars</span> who were available and who shuttled back and forth between the <span class="building">Legation</span> and the <span class="building">houses</span> where they were going to live and they would go back and forth continuously and therefore and so we had to uh provide for everything. </sentence><sentence id="1577">We had to get them settled. </sentence><sentence id="1578">Normally these <span class="building">apartments</span> that we would take, we had to pay the rent, but these are details that are of no importance and perhaps we didn't even pay the rent. </sentence><sentence id="1579">We also had to feed these people and we had to be careful that the Nazis wouldn't go to take them because they did do that. </sentence><sentence id="1580">They did especially they would try to attack those <span class="building">Swedish houses</span> and <span class="building">Swiss houses</span> because they had a, a system of protection which was not correct. </sentence><sentence id="1581">In other words, they had given, both of those <span class="country">countries</span> had a mixed committee, Jewish and Christian committee which was responsible for issuing letters of protection. </sentence><sentence id="1582">To sum it up these letters were being sold. </sentence><sentence id="1583">The authorities and particularly the Nazis found out about this and so therefore every day they, they would come and take uh raid the Swiss and the <span class="building">Swedish houses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1584">I think that as far as I know <span class="country">Sweden</span> issued forty million letters of protection and in its <span class="building">houses</span> it had maybe three or four thousand people because they would come in the afternoon and the next day there would be raids, and this is not something that I just heard. </sentence><sentence id="1585">They weren't rumors. </sentence><sentence id="1586">I saw them with my very own eyes and with Wallenberg I asked him why did you, why do you do that kind of stuff. </sentence><sentence id="1587">That's not correct. </sentence><sentence id="1588">These letters are being sold and everyone knows about it. </sentence><sentence id="1589">The authorities know about it. </sentence><sentence id="1590">Anyway, we had to protect to prevent that these people be taken. </sentence><sentence id="1591">We had to protect them. </sentence><sentence id="1592">With one excuse or the other the Nazi police...not the regular police...the regular police would intervene when they had orders but there was also various police forces, Nazi police forces in various <span class="populated place">neighborhoods</span> of representing various factions which were ferocious. </sentence><sentence id="1593">They killed. </sentence><sentence id="1594">They uh they robbed and that was their goal, and we had to protect the those who were being protected from themselves because these, these people sometimes lacked common sense. </sentence><sentence id="1595">Sometimes it was useless. </sentence><sentence id="1596">It wasn't enough to tell them don't go out of the <span class="building">houses</span> because if you go out of the <span class="building">house</span> they'll take, they take you away. </sentence><sentence id="1597">They put you in the <span class="building">prisons</span> and the Nazis may even kill you, and to...that will give us more work to do because we'll have to come and get you and find you and this happened many times. </sentence><sentence id="1598">They would go and take a walk to go find their girlfriend, to go find their boyfriend...all these things. </sentence><sentence id="1599">Or for whatever reasons, their own reasons. </sentence><sentence id="1600">I even created the committees in each <span class="building">house</span> with three members and their job was to be concerned about hygiene, discipline, order, and to prevent people from leaving the <span class="building">houses</span> and going on the <span class="dlf">streets</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1601">They had to remain inside the <span class="building">houses</span> because there they were safe. </sentence><sentence id="1602">If they left the <span class="building">houses</span>, they were no longer safe. </sentence><sentence id="1603">They would take their stars off and they would go outside and there would be Nazis there who would ask them for their papers This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1604">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1605"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 4 and what papers could they show. </sentence><sentence id="1606">They didn't have any. </sentence><sentence id="1607">If they did, it would be clear that they were Jews and therefore...yeah...you can understand what happened then. </sentence><sentence id="1608">And so we had to find uh food for them and security besides watching. </sentence><sentence id="1609">We were pretty lucky. </sentence><sentence id="1610">It was a continuous job because we had to travel throughout the <span class="populated place">neighborhoods</span> continuously to show the flag, to show that we were present and continuously...I went at least twice a day and daringly, I went daringly on the <span class="dlf">streets</span> and little by little with the with the <span class="spatial object">car</span>...I would go with the <span class="spatial object">car</span> and so the people could see the, the uh flag, so the people could see that the <span class="spatial object">car</span> was guarding them, and therefore and so with time, with the passage of weeks, new <span class="building">houses</span> were organized. </sentence><sentence id="1611">We tried with a <span class="building">hospital</span> too but it was but it failed. </sentence><sentence id="1612">The...it was my idea but it was a bad idea. </sentence><sentence id="1613">It didn't go well. </sentence><sentence id="1614">So weeks went on. </sentence><sentence id="1615">Months went by...sorry...weeks went on and at the end of November we were working continuously and the work with...the contacts with the authorities...I didn't, I didn't think that you didn't need to have contacts with the authorities. </sentence><sentence id="1616">Quite the contrary. </sentence><sentence id="1617">I made as many contacts as possible. </sentence><sentence id="1618">I...one day for example I took ...1 don't know what that is...I took twenty-five thousand _ to the secretary of the minister who was very... ..oh, money. </sentence><sentence id="1619">OK. </sentence><sentence id="1620">This is money that he brought to the Hungarian uh refugees in <span class="populated place">Transylvania</span> and <span class="country">Russia</span> and <span class="populated place">Carpetia</span> and the refugees...and this is money for the children and he was very thankful and every time, every time I was in the <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span> where he...I went up to see him to say hello to him and this gave me the possibility to ask him information all the time, how it was going at the <span class="building">Foreign Affairs Ministry</span>, for example. </sentence><sentence id="1621">For example, since Fritz didn't want to go to the <span class="building">Ministry</span>, since Fritz (ph) never left the <span class="building">Legation</span> to visit a <span class="building">house</span>...he never visited any of the <span class="building">houses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1622">He didn't know anything. </sentence><sentence id="1623">He wasn't interested even in how many signatures were used with his <span class="spatial object">signature pad</span> because he was a diplomat and he had uh limited vision. </sentence><sentence id="1624">He was an old- timer diplomat. </sentence><sentence id="1625">This is a very...what he did was very serious and uh correct but it would have been a good thing in times of peace and in normal times when the war was not ideological as it had become, when there was no persecution of the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1626">Not only of Jews but also the uh in <span

once it ran...once they ran out, I ran out too, and with what I had I could buy something from the <span class="building">black market</span> and specifically I had to be careful with...watch the children because we had two <span class="building">orphanages</span> which were really not ours but one belonged to the <span class="building">International Red Cross</span> I think and one belonged to the <span class="building">Swedish Red Cross</span> and the <span class="building">Spanish Legation</span> had been begged to protect, protect and to take care of these two <span

sixty refugees in the <span class="building">villa</span> of the <span class="building">Legation</span> and, and I understood that I didn't have time to have lunch there, that I had to go back to

stuff, I am letting them know that the Russians are here, that there's going to be some fighting here and that we don't know what the Germans would have done and so forth and so I just said goodbye to

id="1803">We joked around, and at a certain point we had finished our lunch and a courier arrived which gave him, gave the minister something...just like in the movies. </sentence><sentence id="1804">And I think that this...on this piece of paper there was written that he had to leave and in fact he told me...look, I'm sorry but I have to leave and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="1805">So we left. </sentence><sentence id="1806">And I was happy because he didn't ask me anything. </sentence><sentence id="1807">He didn't...he didn't ask anything about the passport, which was a delicate question to hand over a passport. </sentence><sentence id="1808">Yes, I did have passports to give, but if, if the question became known and the Spanish government found out that that the passport had been given to a Nazi minister, the Spanish government undoubtedly would have reacted, and they undoubtedly would have said no, we uh do not authorize this. </sentence><sentence

</sentence><sentence id="1858">So we still continued to issue those letters of protection because the Nazis, Hungarian Nazis...not Germans, Hungarian Nazis...when I speak of Nazis I always refer to the Hungarian Nazis, the Milash (ph)...so...what did I want to say...where was I...where was I...OK. </sentence><sentence id="1859">The first few days of January we heard some rumors according to which it This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1860">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence

place">international ghetto</span> and take them to the old <span class="populated place">grand ghetto</span> and deport them. </sentence><sentence id="1862">I didn't believe in such a thing because they were saying that Minister who was in charge of the civilians and military for the seized (ph) <span class="populated place">capital</span>, they were saying that he was going to burn the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and ,and kill all the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1863">This would have been the final Hungarian solution and I didn't believe in such a thing. </sentence><sentence id="1864">In the meantime new letters were being issued, not very many but there was always someone who felt threatened because they had inspected the <span class="building">house</span> next <span class="dlf">door</span> or the <span class="interior space">apartment</span> above...you know how it is. </sentence><sentence id="1865">So one day uh fourth...on the fourth or fifth or the sixth of January...I don't remember exactly...probably the fifth or the sixth of January, I was crossing <span class="dlf">Mussolini Square</span> to go to the <span class="building">orphanages</span> which were very nearby and I saw a column of Jews passing by and so I asked, who are these Jews? </sentence><sentence id="1866">And they say, these are Jews, uh Portuguese Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1867">That night, during that during the night the Portuguese minister had sent an employee of his to ask me orally to assume the responsibility for the <span class="building">Portuguese Legation</span> and I told him no, that if there is something, if there is something...if he can come and explain to me, then we can come to an agreement, but as it stands I, I didn't... couldn't assume any more responsibilities. </sentence><sentence id="1868">I'd had enough of my own, and so I saw that they took away all those Portuguese Jews and so I understood that that had already, man had already abandoned everything or he was about to abandon everything because he was the Portuguese minister but he was a Hungarian citizen. </sentence><sentence id="1869">He was the deg was his name, but he was a Hungarian citizen, but he was acting as Portuguese minister and therefore that man said he had abandoned everything, that he was stepping back and that he considered uh that he couldn't do anything more. </sentence><sentence id="1870">So I wrote a letter to this minister and I...where I wrote that I had heard these rumors, that I didn't believe in them, that please to deny these rumors but he didn't respond and after two days I wrote him....actually no...I telephoned and I said that I was about to come to see him...that I would come see him the next day and I think that was January 8 or the 7th or the 8th of January. </sentence><sentence id="1871">Probably the 8th. </sentence><sentence id="1872">Perhaps even in the night. </sentence><sentence id="1873">Who knows. </sentence><sentence id="1874">Anyway, it's not that important. </sentence><sentence id="1875">So he went there that day. </sentence><sentence id="1876">I went because I had heard these rumors which were more and more prevalent and then I saw, when I saw the column of the Portuguese Jews I was struck and I went and I found in uh the <span class="interior space">chamber</span> of the <span class="building">city hall</span> <span class="populated place">Budapest</span>, in the <span class="interior space">basement</span>, I found <span class="populated place">Wallenberg</span>, the Swede, and who was Swiss. </sentence><sentence id="1877">And I told them I'm going to go <span class="interior space">inside</span> first because I have an appointment. </sentence><sentence id="1878">My appointment...it hadn't really been conferred to me that I had an appointment but uh and when I return from the appointment then we can all talk together. </sentence><sentence id="1879">The colonel uh who is head of the <span class="building">gendarmerie</span>, accompanied me to the <span class="building">minister's office</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1880">It was a little <span class="building">office</span> in the <span class="interior space">basement</span> and this colonel three days later killed himself by the way. </sentence><sentence id="1881">He saw that everything was lost. </sentence><sentence id="1882">He'd been compromised because of the Jewish question and so he killed himself. </sentence><sentence id="1883">Sada (ph) was his name. </sentence><sentence id="1884">Colonel Sada and he was the head of the whole <span class="building">gendarmerie</span> of <span class="country">Hungary</span> at that time, so I went to this minister that I had seen, not known, but I had seen him in the past and very calmly he said yes. </sentence><sentence id="1885">He wanted to solve the Jewish question by killing everyone. </sentence><sentence id="1886">And so I started to say do you realize what's happening and do you realize what's going to happen, that the Hungarian people will have to suffer because you killed a hundred thousand people, and so finally I even...you know... even talked about the Myian (ph) civilization and everything that came to mind, people...anything to move him. </sentence><sentence id="1887">I even cried. </sentence><sentence id="1888">Uh but he was tough so I didn't know what to do anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1889">I I can't just leave the situation like this, I thought to myself, so I told him, look...if within forty-five hours the Spanish government does not receive from me a guarantee that all is calm and that the agreements between...the agreements with the Hungarian government have been respected because during the period between October, November and December we had This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1890">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1891"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 1 come to an agreement with the Foreign Affairs Minister and the Hungarian government...we had reached an agreement and received guarantees. </sentence><sentence id="1892">Not only that but the Hungarian government wanted to send a diplomatic representative to <span class="populated place">Madrid</span> in order to, to tie diplomatic relations with the Anglo-Americans to see in, in, in view of the peace treaty, and logically the Spanish government who didn't wish to recognize the Nazi government, didn't want to hear anything about it. </sentence><sentence id="1893">The, the uh credentials, the request for credentials...he's explaining uh this...what credentials are...logically I didn't transmit these letters of...this request for credentials to <span class="populated place">Madrid</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1894">It was for a certain Colonel . </sentence><sentence id="1895">I didn't transmit them because if I did the Spanish government would probably say that that they that they didn't accept it because they didn't recognize the government while until then the government, the Spanish government kept quiet. </sentence><sentence id="1896">They kept quiet. </sentence><sentence id="1897">Also the Spanish uh Spanish ambassador last night told me that he saw in the archives many telegrams from the Hungarian government which asked the Spanish government if I was really the charge d'affaires. </sentence><sentence id="1898">The Spanish government never answered. </sentence><sentence id="1899">The Spanish ambassador told me that last night. </sentence><sentence id="1900">They never...the Spanish government never responded to these telegrams. </sentence><sentence id="1901">I understood naturally, slowly...I slowly understood why we had a preferential treatment with the Hungarian government and this was because they wanted to have diplomatic relations with <span class="country">Spain</span> to contact the Anglo-Americans. </sentence><sentence id="1902">We understood it late, but we understood it. </sentence><sentence id="1903">If we understood it immediately, maybe two months earlier because we're already talking about the beginning of November...had we understood it earlier, two months ago, we would have behaved differently and perhaps something more could have been done I think but uh we're not...we weren't that intelligent after all. </sentence><sentence id="1904">The Spanish ambassador told me not that...not everyone is intelligent. </sentence><sentence id="1905">I wasn't intelligent. </sentence><sentence id="1906">The other the other guy also wasn't intelligent so uh what do you want. </sentence><sentence id="1907">So I told him that if within forty-five hours the Spanish government doesn't get any guarantees that everything is proceeding with order the three thousand Hungarian citizens which are, who are in, in <span class="country">Spain</span> will be interned...actually there were really a hundred including the diplomats...and their goods will be seized and this, the Spanish government will...or ask the Brazilian government and the Paraguayan government to do the same with those Hungarian citizens who were in <span class="country">Brazil</span> and <span class="country">Paraguay</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1908">So this minister said a friendly government like the Spanish government would do such a thing? </sentence><sentence id="1909">What friendly government? </sentence><sentence id="1910">If you are against us, you're the ones who are against us. </sentence><sentence id="1911">This is what we want. </sentence><sentence id="1912">We want to protect these Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1913">You don't want to do it, so you are coming against our interests and against our policy and against our interests and our wishes, so how can you say that we are friends. </sentence><sentence id="1914">We're friends if you say, if you do what we want. </sentence><sentence id="1915">To sum it up he said, OK. </sentence><sentence id="1916">The Spaniards are, are excluded from the liquidation, will be excluded from the liquidation and so I said no, and I became uh demanding in that moment. </sentence><sentence id="1917">I said no. </sentence><sentence id="1918">All...everyone or nobody. </sentence><sentence id="1919">All of those in the <span class="populated place">international ghetto</span> must remain where they are or all those in the common <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> must be, must have electricity
