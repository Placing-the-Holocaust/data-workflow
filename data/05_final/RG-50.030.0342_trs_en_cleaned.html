<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1">Q: Good afternoon, <span class="populated place">Flory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2">Can you please tell me your full name and where you were born. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: My name is Flory Jagoda, and I was born in <span class="populated place">Sarajevo</span>, <span class="country">Bosnia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6">You want to know when? </sentence><sentence id="7">I don't think I should tell you -- December 21st, 1923. </sentence><sentence id="8">A lot of years. </sentence><sentence id="9">Actually, most of the survivors are this age, maybe a little younger, a little older. </sentence><sentence id="10">But this is more or less around 70s and so. </sentence><sentence id="11">And they have one thing in common -- silence. </sentence><sentence id="12">They sort of don't like to talk. </sentence><sentence id="13">We don't like to -- it is almost like a wound that, you know, you heal. </sentence><sentence id="14">And you don't want to scratch it. </sentence><sentence id="15">It bleeds. </sentence><sentence id="16">And also, a lot of them do not want to burden their families, especially their children, with sadness. </sentence><sentence id="17">They want to forget. </sentence><sentence id="18">And it works for a while. </sentence><sentence id="19">You have children, and you have weddings, and grandchildren, and music lessons, and piano lessons. </sentence><sentence id="20">And I was teaching music myself for 25 years. </sentence><sentence id="21">So I was quite a busy lady. </sentence><sentence id="22">Then all of a sudden, children leave, and marry, and get a little older. </sentence><sentence id="23">And you know, you don't sleep. </sentence><sentence id="24">You sort of start dreaming, and seeing some images and faces of your family -- and, uh, you wake up in the morning disturbed and restless. </sentence><sentence id="25">And, uh, then you read these horrible stories -- there was no holocaust -- never happened -- and you know what that means to a survivor -- no holocaust? </sentence><sentence id="26">Your whole inner starts screaming. </sentence><sentence id="27">I think the age -- and I also think the story of the holocaust never happened -- is -- I think it broke the silence of a lot of holocaust survivors. </sentence><sentence id="28">Age definitely had something to do with it. </sentence><sentence id="29">So here Iam. </sentence><sentence id="30">I'm going to take you to a small little <span class="populated place">town</span> in <span class="country">Bosnia</span>, and share with you my childhood. </sentence><sentence id="31">Actually, I'm not going to start in <span class="populated place">Sarajevo</span>. </sentence><sentence id="32">We will go about 98 kilometers up <span class="region">northeast</span> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="33">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="34"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection <span class="country">Bosnia</span>, a small <span class="populated place">town</span> called <span class="populated place">Vlasenica</span>, very picturesque. </sentence><sentence id="35">It's know for its <span class="env feature">pine trees</span>. </sentence><sentence id="36">My whole family lived there. </sentence><sentence id="37">Their name was Altarac, the Altarac family. </sentence><sentence id="38">And they were very proud of their name. </sentence><sentence id="39">It meant , the high place -- very proud of that. </sentence><sentence id="40">And, you know, all these <span class="populated place">towns</span> that you read today unfortunately, from <span class="populated place">Srebenica</span> to <span class="populated place">Rogatica</span> to, which is close to <span class="populated place">Gorazde</span>, to <span class="populated place">Travnik</span>, to <span class="populated place">Zvornik</span> -- all these little, tiny <span class="populated place">towns</span> had -- besides Moslems and Serbs, they also had a Bosnian Sephardi Jewish <span class="populated place">communities</span>. </sentence><sentence id="41">A lot of people don't know that -- Bosnian Jews -- Los Judeos <span class="country">Bosnia</span>, they would say in <span class="populated place">Ladino</span>. </sentence><sentence id="42">And they came from <span class="populated place">Sarajevo</span>. </sentence><sentence id="43">Actually, they were descendants of the Spanish refugees that were expelled from <span class="country">Spain</span> in 1492 -- the inquisition -- <span class="country">Spain</span> and <span class="country">Portugal</span>. </sentence><sentence id="44">The word <span class="populated place">Sepharad</span> means <span class="region">Iberian peninsula</span> in Hebrew. </sentence><sentence id="45">Actually, they had no choice. </sentence><sentence id="46">I mean, they had to leave, or convert to Catholicism, or leave <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="47">They were given three months. </sentence><sentence id="48">A lot of them converted. </sentence><sentence id="49">A lot of them remained. </sentence><sentence id="50">They couldn't leave the <span class="country">country</span> they really loved. </sentence><sentence id="51">My ancestors went towards <span class="country">Turkey</span>. </sentence><sentence id="52">There sultan Bayazid II gave orders to -- throughout his <span class="country">Ottoman Empire</span> -- to let the refugees in, give them freedom, to worship, to build <span class="building">synagogues</span>, and, most of all, freedom to travel through his <span class="country">Ottoman Empire</span>. </sentence><sentence id="53">So there were big communities in <span class="populated place">Salonika</span>, <span class="country">Greece</span>, <span class="country">Bulgaria</span> -- <span class="populated place">Sarajevo</span> definitely became a thriving Sephardi community. </sentence><sentence id="54">They called it a <span class="building">Yirushaliam</span>, the small <span class="populated place">Jerusalem</span>, with their <span class="building">religious schools</span> and -- so, from <span class="populated place">Sarajevo</span>, looking for new opportunities, they went to these small <span class="populated place">towns</span> and <span class="populated place">villages</span> that you read about today. </sentence><sentence id="55">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="56">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="57"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Now the life in <span class="populated place">Vlasenica</span> -- it was a very simple life. </sentence><sentence id="58">The family was very close nit, about 15 families, 15, 16, families -- most of them, Altarac families. </sentence><sentence id="59">And in my family, definitely, the leader was my nona (ph.), </sentence><sentence id="60">my grandmother. </sentence><sentence id="61">My nona was a kind of a grandmother that a child dreams of having, not because only -- I mean, her voice was something that was unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="62">She sang beautifully. </sentence><sentence id="63">But she was a midwife, a well known midwife, in all the neighboring <span class="populated place">villages</span>, she knew herbs. </sentence><sentence id="64">Her <span class="building">house</span> was always full of women with babies and children -- "What do I give to this one?" -- " </sentence><sentence id="65">What do I" -- "What herb do I use?". </sentence><sentence id="66">She was the one to put the first pair of earrings through the babies" ears. </sentence><sentence id="67">And naturally, she was the leader of her own band, as we say in <span class="country">America</span> -- leader of the band. </sentence><sentence id="68">She had her own singing family, which was well known as the Altarac family, the singing Altarac family, five daughters and three sons. </sentence><sentence id="69">She was the teacher of religion in the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="70">Women did not go to the <span class="building">synagogue</span> as much as we see here. </sentence><sentence id="71">The men usually went to <span class="building">synagogue</span>, took their sons, taught them Hebrew. </sentence><sentence id="72">And the woman stayed at <span class="building">home</span>, and she taught her daughters and granddaughters tradition, religion, heritage. </sentence><sentence id="73">All that she learned from her nona, and her bis- nona, the great grandmother, just went on from generation to generation. </sentence><sentence id="74">They lived there for about four centuries, and the old peacefully died, and the young were born and married, and there was harmony in <span class="populated place">Vlasenica</span> -- the Moslems and Serbs and Jews lived in harmony there. </sentence><sentence id="75">I never remember hate or quarrels. </sentence><sentence id="76">The women visited and the children went to <span class="building">school</span> together. </sentence><sentence id="77">I would never, never, never, believe that the madness of the Second World War would bring something. </sentence><sentence id="78">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="79">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="80"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection So, uh, the life didn't have too much change. </sentence><sentence id="81">And more or less, everybody was quite satisfied, went along with the life as it was. </sentence><sentence id="82">But my nona's family -- there was one daughter -- she just couldn't take it -- that was my mother, Rosa (ph.). </sentence><sentence id="83">And she was actually considered as a rebel. </sentence><sentence id="84">I mean, she always dreamt of far-away places, she read books that she was not supposed to read. </sentence><sentence id="85">If there was something in the family -- or the girls wanted to try something new, let Rosa do it first -- to eat something -- let Rosa taste it first. </sentence><sentence id="86">She was just very, very different. </sentence><sentence id="87">So finally, she talked her family to send her to <span class="populated place">Sarajevo</span>, which was a thriving -- I mean, big <span class="populated place">city</span> at that time, huh? </sentence><sentence id="88">And she went to stay with my tia esperansa (ph.). </sentence><sentence id="89">Tia is aunt. </sentence><sentence id="90">And I will be adding some of these Ladino words, because they just fit in with the words that I'm saying. </sentence><sentence id="91">It's, as we call it, <span class="building">Lingua De la Madri</span> (ph.), </sentence><sentence id="92">the language of the mother. </sentence><sentence id="93">This was the language in the <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="94">You passed the <span class="dlf">door</span>, and you did not hear Serb or Croatian words. </sentence><sentence id="95">It was only in <span class="populated place">Ladino</span>, as we call it, Judeo-Spanish. </sentence><sentence id="96">Sometimes, we would come <span class="building">home</span> and -- with non-Jewish friends -- and I would sort of be a little embarrassed, I would say nona-- can't you speak so -- they'll think maybe we're talking something, you know, behind their back. </sentence><sentence id="97">She would look at me very seriously. </sentence><sentence id="98">She'd say . </sentence><sentence id="99">And she'd say, "You know, you are Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="100">You have to speak Jewish." </sentence><sentence id="101">This is her Jewish language. </sentence><sentence id="102">She considered that as her religious, Jewish language. </sentence><sentence id="103">It was written in Hebrew letters, Rashi. </sentence><sentence id="104">And all her prayers were written in that language. </sentence><sentence id="105">So she considered that her religion. </sentence><sentence id="106">She was very religious, and she raised a very, very religious

http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection family. </sentence><sentence id="109">Anyway, going back to my mother, Rosa -- she finally managed to go to <span class="populated place">Sarajevo</span>. </sentence><sentence id="110">And she falls in love. </sentence><sentence id="111">She falls in love with a musician. </sentence><sentence id="112">And what did he play? </sentence><sentence id="113">Accordion and guitar. </sentence><sentence id="114">And he had a gorgeous voice. </sentence><sentence id="115">The moment the family heard a musician -- I mean, it was something you should never even consider. </sentence><sentence id="116">A nice Jewish family -- I mean, a girl, a Sephardic girl, to marry a musician who plays for money? </sentence><sentence id="117">I mean, you are blessed with a voice. </sentence><sentence id="118">That means that God gave you a gift so you can help and share with other people -- not to take the money. </sentence><sentence id="119">But you know, nothing would help. </sentence><sentence id="120">And as much as they really respected the father -- you never questioned grandfather -- whatever he said, that was it. </sentence><sentence id="121">She decided to marry -- Samuel Poppel (ph.) </sentence><sentence id="122">was his name -- very handsome Samuel Poppel. </sentence><sentence id="123">And she found out very, very early that it was no big deal, because Samuel Poppel played all night and slept all day -- and at night, he was out singing , which is a <span class="country">Bosnian</span> folk song. </sentence><sentence id="124">And after she had the baby -- she right away had the baby, little Floritza, which is me, she wrote a letter to her father -- "I want to come <span class="building">home</span>." </sentence><sentence id="125">And the father came to <span class="populated place">Sarajevo</span>, he arranged a real Jewish divorce, and took his daughter and little Floritza back to his <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="126">And she brought shame to the family. </sentence><sentence id="127">A divorced daughter in the family? </sentence><sentence id="128">Never heard of it. </sentence><sentence id="129">Never was a divorce in <span class="populated place">Vlasenica</span>. </sentence><sentence id="130">So here she was with a child. </sentence><sentence id="131">She couldn't meet with a man because -- the single people -- single men are not going to look -- a divorced girl with a baby. </sentence><sentence id="132">So, she was very lonely. </sentence><sentence id="133">Her life was spent with her family. </sentence><sentence id="134">They sang a lot. </sentence><sentence id="135">They have, every Sunday, a picnic in different <span class="interior space">gardens</span>. </sentence><sentence id="136">And there was a lamb on a <span class="env feature">spit</span>, and a lot of singing. </sentence><sentence id="137">So that was, really, her life. </sentence><sentence id="138">And I, actually, was never supposed to ask about Samuel Poppel. </sentence><sentence id="139">It was something you never asked, you never talked This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="140">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="141"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection about. </sentence><sentence id="142">I never saw him. </sentence><sentence id="143">I don't even know what he looks like. </sentence><sentence id="144">But my grandfather went right away to work to find a husband for Rosa. </sentence><sentence id="145">The marriages were, really, arranged. </sentence><sentence id="146">The father, the grandfather, would call you, you would kiss his hand, and he would say, "I have a husband for you." </sentence><sentence id="147">You would kiss his hand again, and you were very happy. </sentence><sentence id="148">In one way, it was just -- it was very simple. </sentence><sentence id="149">You didn't have to worry about the singles, or "Where am I going to meet a man?". </sentence><sentence id="150">And usually, the father knew what the -- you know, what kind of man their daughter needs. </sentence><sentence id="151">So every little <span class="populated place">town</span> from the <span class="populated place">Srebenica</span> to <span class="populated place">Travnik</span> as I told you before -- the families kept in touch, they visited each other, and they knew exactly who had daughters, who had sons, their ages. </sentence><sentence id="152">And in between the <span class="populated place">cities</span>, there were such people as <span class="building">Casmententeros</span>, the matchmakers. </sentence><sentence id="153">They usually -- it was a side job, besides what they were doing -- and they would get 20 percent here, and 20 percent on the other side. </sentence><sentence id="154">They would match, give parties. </sentence><sentence id="155">So they found a match. </sentence><sentence id="156">And it was a salesman who was traveling from <span class="populated place">city</span> to <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="157">They only spoke in <span class="populated place">Judeo</span>, in <span class="populated place">Ladino</span>. </sentence><sentence id="158">The salesman too. </sentence><sentence id="159">Everything was done in this Ladino language in between them. </sentence><sentence id="160">So his name was Mikaiel (ph.) </sentence><sentence id="161">Poppel -- no -- sorry -- Mikaiel Cabeelio (ph.). </sentence><sentence id="162">Poppel was my father who I never met. </sentence><sentence id="163">And Mikaiel Cabeelio comes to <span class="populated place">Vlasenica</span>, and meets Rosa. </sentence><sentence id="164">And by golly, she liked him. </sentence><sentence id="165">She was very picky, you know? </sentence><sentence id="166">She was a very pretty, pretty girl, pretty woman. </sentence><sentence id="167">I'll show you a picture later -- very pretty. </sentence><sentence id="168">And they arranged a wedding. </sentence><sentence id="169">Naturally, I was not at the wedding. </sentence><sentence id="170">I was sent to play with the cousins. </sentence><sentence id="171">It was something that was not part of me, which -- it hurt, you know, later on -- when you get older, you think back, "Well, how could they do that to me?". </sentence><sentence id="172">You know. </sentence><sentence id="173">Anyway, she gets married, and they go to the <span class="populated place">city</span> of <span class="populated place">Zagreb</span>, a big <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="174">This is what she wanted to do, to go live in a big <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="175">And they left. </sentence><sentence id="176">To This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection my happiness, because I was going to stay with nona. </sentence><sentence id="179">And I adored that woman -- just adored. </sentence><sentence id="180">I think all the feeling that I have for this Sephardic culture, for stories, for songs -- it's all really a gift from her to me that I will have for the rest of my life. </sentence><sentence id="181">It was -- I considered her as my mother. </sentence><sentence id="182">I didn't miss <span class="populated place">Rosa</span>. </sentence><sentence id="183">It's sad. </sentence><sentence id="184">But that's just the way it was. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="377">Q: How old were you when they got married and left for <span class="populated place">Zagreb</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="379">A: Well, before nine. </sentence><sentence id="380">I was about seven, or maybe even younger, because I -- no -- seven, because I stayed with nona two years, until they got settled. </sentence><sentence id="381">And then, one day, my grandfather comes in with a hat on, a real hat. </sentence><sentence id="382">You know, I was used to seeing my grandfather dressed with a . </sentence><sentence id="383">All the Jews in <span class="populated place">Vlasencia</span> and all these little <span class="populated place">towns</span> -- they were dressed the same as the Moslems. </sentence><sentence id="384">You wouldn't know which one's which. </sentence><sentence id="385">They all had , and shuck sheers (ph.) -- </sentence><sentence id="386">that's pantaloon pants. </sentence><sentence id="387">And he put a hat on because, I guess, he wanted to look a little more modern. </sentence><sentence id="388">He was going to a big <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="389">And, oh, it was tough on me. </sentence><sentence id="390">I hated that day. </sentence><sentence id="391">I'll never forget it as long as I live. </sentence><sentence id="392">My nona gives me an orange bag with the pictures of my family, all my aunts. </sentence><sentence id="393">And she said , don't ever forget your <span class="populated place">Mishpachah</span> (ph.), </sentence><sentence id="394">which is, really, a Hebrew word. </sentence><sentence id="395">But it's family. </sentence><sentence id="396">And she gave me a little gold locket, which I still carry with me all the time. </sentence><sentence id="397">And she said, "Anywhere you go, carry that with you. </sentence><sentence id="398">So those were the two very precious things that I had all my life with me, even today. </sentence><sentence id="399">I'll show it to you later. </sentence><sentence id="400"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken

mean, I couldn't recognize my mother before anything else. </sentence><sentence id="403">She was very dressed up in very beautiful clothes. </sentence><sentence id="404">And my stepfather, my new father, who adopted me -- and I became Floritza Cabeelio -- he started a necktie business, and she was in business with him, very active, very -- this is what she wanted. </sentence><sentence id="405">This is the kind of life she wanted. </sentence><sentence id="406">She could not take that small, <span class="populated place">village</span> existence. </sentence><sentence id="407">And she mingled with -- socially, with the Ashkenazi Jews, who are a little different than the Sephardim in that <span class="region">part of the world</span>. </sentence><sentence id="408">They were modern. </sentence><sentence id="409">They were from Austrian background and they spoke German at <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="410">And socially, this is where she felt more

for herself that she could never get -- had music lessons, piano lessons, ballet, and drawing, and went to <span class="building">Maccabi</span> (ph.) -- </sentence><sentence id="417">that's like, a <span class="building">health club</span> -- three times a week -- had tickets for the operetta on Sunday afternoon -- Lahar, I knew all the Lahar pieces by heart at the time. </sentence><sentence
