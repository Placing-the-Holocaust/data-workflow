<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="22">Q: Tell me about growing up. </sentence><sentence id="23">Did you grow up there? </sentence><sentence id="24">And your very early years, before the Nazis came. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="28">A: What little I remember, really, in that period: I grew up in <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>, in that <span class="populated place">town</span>, very uneventfully; a small <span class="populated place">resort town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="29">From what I remember, what little I remember, a very pleasant environment. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="32">Q: You moved at one point. </sentence><sentence id="33">Where did you move to, again, before the Nazis? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="36">A: Well, we moved from <span class="populated place">Lubochnia</span> to a <span class="populated place">town</span> in <span class="country">Slovakia</span> called Zilina(ph). </sentence><sentence id="37">The--my, my father had bought a <span class="building">hotel</span> in, in this <span class="populated place">town</span> in <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>, in <span class="populated place">Lubochnia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="38">It was a <span class="building">hotel</span> that was designed to be for German political refugees awaiting the fall of Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="39">My father thought that Hitler would not last more than four years, and he wanted to be nearby and have his friends there. </sentence><sentence id="40">Well, by, by 1938, very few people could come out of <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="41">So the <span class="building">hotel</span> wasn't going very well. </sentence><sentence id="42">And at that point, we left the <span class="building">hotel</span> and moved to Zilina(ph). </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="50">Q: All right. </sentence><sentence id="51">What happened there, when by 1938, "39? </sentence><sentence id="52">Did things change? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="56">A: Well, the -- in <span class="country">Slovakia</span>, the Hlinka, Hlinka Guard, which was a fascist group aligned with the Nazis, began harassing Jews and looking for certain people, and my father was one of the people they apparently had on, on some list. </sentence><sentence id="57">It became clear to us that if we didn't leave the  risk -- at least, the risk to my parents -- that the risk was very great. </sentence><sentence id="58">And that at some point, shortly before the German invasion, we tried to cross the <span class="dlf">border</span> into <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="59">It took about a week to cross the <span class="dlf">border</span>, in, in <span class="region">no-man's-land</span> between <span class="country">Poland</span> and, and <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="60">The last time when we -- in <span class="region">no-man's-land</span>, when we went -- were shipped back to <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>, then the Germans were already there, in <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="61">And it was curious that it was the Germans who actually helped us get into <span class="country">Poland</span> at that point. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="68">Q: How do you mean, helped you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="70">A: Well, the Germans didn't realize who we were. </sentence><sentence id="71">And my father told them that he was Polish, and that the Poles wouldn't let us in. </sentence><sentence id="72">And so they actually carried our <span class="spatial object">suitcases</span> and told the Poles that they had to let us in. </sentence><sentence id="73">And that's how we entered <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="78">Q: Okay, Okay. </sentence><sentence id="79">But you entered <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="80">And where did you go? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="84">A: Well, we had political refugee status, my father, and we went to <span class="populated place">Katowice</span>, in southern -- in <span class="country">Poland</span>, to await our entry, or the right to leave for <span class="country">England</span>. </sentence><sentence id="85">My father had papers that would have allowed him to go to <span class="country">England</span>. </sentence><sentence id="86">We registered in <span class="populated place">Katowice</span> with the <span class="building">British Consul</span> and waited there until we were supposed to be called up to, to leave for <span class="country">England</span>. </sentence><sentence id="87">And it was really on the day when the Germans moved into, into <span class="country">Poland</span>, on September first that we were supposed to be leaving for <span class="country">England</span>. </sentence><sentence id="88">And we actually left. </sentence><sentence id="89">What happened was that the <span class="building">British Consul</span> -- there were quite a number of refugees in our position -- were put on a <span class="spatial object">train</span> chartered by the British to take us to the, to the <span class="region">Balkans</span>, and hopefully, from there to <span class="country">England</span>. </sentence><sentence id="90">But the <span class="spatial object">plane</span> -- the <span class="spatial object">train</span> -- never got very far; because we were bombed by <span class="spatial object">German planes</span> and had to abandon the <span class="spatial object">train</span> in <span class="country">Poland</span> not, not very far from the <span class="dlf">Russian border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="91">And at that point, the question was: "What do what do we do next?" </sentence><sentence id="92">My, my father actually went and crossed into, into the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span>, across the <span class="env feature">Bug River</span>; and came back and decided -- actually, he had crossed over to see whether we should go to the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span> -- crossed over and decided that we weren't going to be much better off there than if we stayed in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="93">So he came back. </sentence><sentence id="94">And we then marched with the refugees on the, on the <span class="dlf">roads</span> and were actually taken over by <span class="spatial object">German tanks</span> on, on the <span class="dlf">roads</span> near some <span class="populated place">village</span> in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="95">After a while, we ended up in a <span class="populated place">town</span> more or less in <span class="region">central Poland</span>, called <span class="populated place">Kielce</span>, and eventually ended up in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> of <span class="populated place">Kielce</span>, and so forth. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="108">Q: Tell us -- by then, you are five. </sentence><sentence id="109">Tell us, if you can -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="112">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="113">By then, I'm -- yeah, five. </sentence><sentence id="114">Yes, six. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="118">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="119">Tell me what you remember of <span class="populated place">Kielce</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="122">A: Well, <span class="populated place">Kielce</span> was, was -- at least from what I remember initially, or maybe in retrospect -- it's often very hard to keep these things apart. </sentence><sentence id="123">I had never se -- <span class="populated place">Kielce</span> really had a very large  <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span>, and I've since found out that there were more than twenty thousand Jews in <span class="populated place">Kielce</span> -- a long tradition. </sentence><sentence id="124">There were a lot of very religious Jews. </sentence><sentence id="125">There were <span class="building">Jewish schools</span> and everything -- things I had never seen before in -- in <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>, where, where we were. </sentence><sentence id="126">There were -- let me see, what else do I remember from the initial period?There was another language -- two languages, in fact: both Yiddish and Polish. </sentence><sentence id="127">Initially -- again, until things, until 1941, "42, things were not all that bad. </sentence><sentence id="128">It was when the when the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was established, all the Jews were herded into one part of the <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="129">Food became very scarce. </sentence><sentence id="130"><span class="building">Housing</span> became very scarce. </sentence><sentence id="131">We lived in, in one <span class="interior space">room</span> that my father and mother and I shared. </sentence><sentence id="132">And food was very difficult to come by. </sentence><sentence id="133">A lot of, lot of hunger, but still not as serious. </sentence><sentence id="134">There were still a lot of people who lived quite well, who had, had ways of getting food into the, into the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, especially in the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="135">Things gradually became harder and harder. </sentence><sentence id="136">And the, the <span class="dlf">walls</span> were -- protection was built up much heavier than initially. </sentence><sentence id="137">Initially, it was still possible for people to go in and out, I remember. </sentence><sentence id="138">But after a while that became more difficult. </sentence><sentence id="139">Then, of course, in 1942, the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="140">Most of the people in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> -- I would think about some close to 20,000 people -- were shipped to <span class="populated place">Treblinka</span>," and that included my grandparents as well. </sentence><sentence id="141">That was sort of the first really serious killing experience that, that I had. </sentence><sentence id="142">During -- I should note, though, that in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> itself there were -- ifnot daily, certainly sporadic -- killings going on by Germans of people, German guards of Jews on the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="143">At the same time, there appeared to be some sort of normalcy that, that reigned, but then in "42, all of that came to an end. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="167">Q: Can you describe the deportation? </sentence><sentence id="168">What did you see? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="171">A: Well, the, the--one morning we were awakened with screaming and shooting outside -- orders in German: "Everybody out!" </sentence><sentence id="172">And whoever wasn't to be out would be would be shot, and apparently a lot of older people, others who couldn't move, were shot. </sentence><sentence id="173">My father, who was, was a very cool person -- that's sort of the, the memory I have -- wasn't going to move until he had shaved and had time to think what to do. </sentence><sentence id="174">And -- actually that's what saved us because he took a group, he took us and a group of people out and marched us to -- he had been in charge of a <span class="building">shop</span> -- and marched us out to the <span class="building">shop</span>, saying that he had orders to protect the <span class="building">shop</span> and keep the, the people in. </sentence><sentence id="175">And that's -- and safeguard a number of people, about twenty people, protecting the <span class="building">shop</span>. </sentence><sentence id="176">And actually, that's how I was not initially shipped out. </sentence><sentence id="177">The -- we did, however, at the end -- when the, when the Nazis finally caught up with us -- we were all lined up, as everybody else. </sentence><sentence id="178">And you had most of the people marching in, in one direction, and maybe a few hundred people being saved. </sentence><sentence id="179">And we were in that group to : The <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was established in April 1941. </sentence><sentence id="180">&gt; This event, which constituted the liquidation of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, took place from August 20 to August 24, 1942. </sentence><sentence id="181"> end up in another <span class="populated place">camp</span>, sort of a <span class="populated place">forced labor camp</span>, also in <span class="populated place">Kielce</span>. </sentence><sentence id="182">I'm compressing all of this a great deal. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="196">Q: It's okay, we have time, we have time. </sentence><sentence id="197">Can you tell us about the <span class="populated place">forced labor camp</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="200">A: Well, that was basically -- when you, when you think of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> as a substantial section of <span class="populated place">town</span>, the <span class="populated place">forced labor camp</span> was basically one <span class="dlf">street</span> that was surrounded with barbed wire and, and other -- or maybe two <span class="dlf">streets</span>. </sentence><sentence id="201">And most of the people worked -- were taken out from there to work in various, various jobs. </sentence><sentence id="202">I didn't do anything. </sentence><sentence id="203">I was there with my mother. </sentence><sentence id="204">And matter of fact, my mother had saved two other children from the--whose, whose parents had --were shipped out in, in "42. </sentence><sentence id="205">Two children had been left, and she took them in. </sentence><sentence id="206">So we ended up then in, in one-half <span class="interior space">room</span>, I think, with, with two other children yet. </sentence><sentence id="207">And -- but life still, put it -- given what was to follow, was still more or less livable, but very -- under very difficult circumstances. </sentence><sentence id="208">Here the killing increased. </sentence><sentence id="209">Every so often, or anybody tried to escape, there would be executions and beatings and other things. </sentence><sentence id="210">The, the worst thing that happened in that <span class="populated place">camp</span> was towards the end, when the -- when -- I think it was in, in "43, or the beginning of "44 -- and I'm -- my dates are wrong -- when there was another Selektion", Basically, you know, when people were shipped off to be killed. </sentence><sentence id="211">What happened there was that all the -- they lined us up on a sort of like a <span class="interior space">playground</span>, and separated all the children, and that became the, the famous massacre of the children in <span class="populated place">Kielce</span>. </sentence><sentence id="212">I was the only one to survive -- at least of the group that was, was visible. </sentence><sentence id="213">Two other children saved themselves by hiding in the <span class="building">house</span> where the children were taken. </sentence><sentence id="214">But what happened there was that the, the children who were taken out, ended up -- were taken to a <span class="dlf">cemetery</span> and killed with hand grenades. </sentence><sentence id="215">The <span class="dlf">Jewish cemetery</span> in, in <span class="populated place">Kielce</span>; I, I survived that one. </sentence><sentence id="216">That was the worst part in that, that episode. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="234">Q: How did you survive? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="236">A: Very curious. </sentence><sentence id="237">They had us lined up on the <span class="dlf">field</span>. </sentence><sentence id="238">The German, the commander of the, of the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, was standing in the middle making the decision who was going to live and who was going to die, and they pulled tried to pull me out, and my mother and father more or less pulled the other direction. </sentence><sentence id="239">And finally, they -- my mother, my father and I deci -- went up to the German commander; and I said, in German, that I -- to let me live, because I could work. </sentence><sentence id="240">And in German. </sentence><sentence id="241">And I, I think what, what I saw happen in <span class="populated place">camps</span> a number of times was that they were somehow shocked to find that somebody looked very much like their own children, who spoke the same language the way their own children would speak, was there. </sentence><sentence id="242">They had -- I think they believed a lot of their own propaganda. </sentence><sentence id="243">And he looked at me and 3 Nazi term for the selection of prisoners for transport. </sentence><sentence id="244"> said in German, "Well, let's see," and let me go. </sentence><sentence id="245">The whole thing may have lasted two seconds. </sentence><sentence id="246">And that's how I stayed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="259">Q: What happened to you after that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="261">A: Well, after that we ended up in, in a <span class="building">factory</span>, in -- still in <span class="populated place">Kielce</span>. </sentence><sentence id="262">The surviving people in this group -- I think about two hundred -- were split up, half taken to one <span class="building">factory</span>, another half to another <span class="building">factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="263">My parents and I ended up in a, in a -- and, incidentally, the two children who were younger than I that we had then died in that also. </sentence><sentence id="264">We, we ended up in a <span class="building">factory</span> where they were making <span class="spatial object">carts</span> for -- <span class="spatial object">wooden carts</span> -- for their <span class="region">Eastern Front</span>. </sentence><sentence id="265">At that point I had a very interesting job and assignment. </sentence><sentence id="266">The feeling was that, that to survive there, it was important to have something to do; and, and I wasn't even 10 years old. </sentence><sentence id="267">So I went to the commander, commander of the German -- of that <span class="populated place">camp</span>; and told him, asked him whether he needed an errand boy. </sentence><sentence id="268">And he looked at me, and he said, "Fine." </sentence><sentence id="269">And so basically, my, my job in that, in that <span class="populated place">camp</span> consisted of sitting outside his <span class="dlf">door</span> and doing chores that he needed to have done, like getting his <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> or taking something to one place or another. </sentence><sentence id="270">The, the job had great advantages because I could hear what was going on and could report back, and I could also alert people to his coming because I would be going ahead of him, running, announcing his coming. </sentence><sentence id="271">And so we had the signal that I would signal. </sentence><sentence id="272">He had -- he wore a hat with a feather; and if 1 went like this to people [gesturing], then he was coming. </sentence><sentence id="273">And -- because if people were seen not working, they would be beaten very badly. </sentence><sentence id="274">One interesting episode in that connection is that I could listen to the <span class="spatial object">radio</span>. </sentence><sentence id="275">He would listen to the <span class="spatial object">radio</span>, and I would sit <span class="region">outside</span>, and I could hear. </sentence><sentence id="276">And I heard the, the capture of Mussolini," reported it. </sentence><sentence id="277">Of course, nobody believed me. </sentence><sentence id="278">We had no access to radio or any news. </sentence><sentence id="279">But that was -- and the fact that I worked there actually enabled us to have some food, and my father and mother both worked in that <span class="building">factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="280">But it was one way of, of surviving, and giving me a cer -- certain amount of protection, as well. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="301">Q: Did things change at some point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="303">A: Well, what changed at, at some point was that in 1944 the decision was made, I guess, to ship everybody in that <span class="populated place">camp</span> to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="304">And we were, we were shipped to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>." </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="307">Q: Can you describe the <span class="spatial object">transport</span>? </sentence><sentence id="308">What was that like? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="368">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="369">Describe where you were taken and what you did, what the <span class="building">barrack</span> was like where you lived. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="372">A: Well, the <span class="building">barracks</span> were very much like the <span class="building">barracks</span> you see in pictures that one sees. </sentence><sentence id="373">These big three story <span class="spatial object">bunks</span>, very broad, with about ten people fitting into them -- just wooden, wooden boards, very crowded. </sentence><sentence id="374">The first night on arrival, that was, was probably one of the : Overseers (German). </sentence><sentence id="375">7 <span class="dlf">Birkenau section B-IIe</span>. </sentence><sentence id="376"> worst in, in my experience because this was the night when one or two of the people who had been collaborators in our <span class="populated place">camp</span> and had shipped some people to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> were beaten very badly. </sentence><sentence id="377">So this was by people who had -- whom they had shipped to the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, who in the meantime themselves had become Kapos. </sentence><sentence id="378">The world never changes. </sentence><sentence id="379">But, that was sort of the first, the first night, that experience. </sentence><sentence id="380">That's, you know, the, the sort of initial thing I remember of <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="381">We -- there were some people that I. -- my father knew, who had been shipped out before. </sentence><sentence id="382">There again, my father and some friends thought that the way for me to survive was to try to find something to do. </sentence><sentence id="383">And I went -- or rather, I don't know who went. </sentence><sentence id="384">But at any rate, I managed to get to be the errand boy for the Kapo in the, in the <span class="spatial object">laundry</span> and sau -- I don't know what they called it. </sentence><sentence id="385">A place where people... The <span class="interior space">wash rooms</span>. </sentence><sentence id="386">And that, again I think, helped because I, I had a certain protection by being there and also knowing when the Selektion process was going to, to happen. </sentence><sentence id="387">Because you could -- in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, the Selektion of people, the Selektion out to the <span class="building">crematorium</span>, to the <span class="interior space">gas chambers</span> would usually happen every six weeks. </sentence><sentence id="388">The Germans, with their efficiency, would never repeat things immediately or do things irregularly. </sentence><sentence id="389">So, you could expect things to happen every four to six weeks, and it usually happened with certain people arriving in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="390">And if you knew that was going to happen and if you were where I was, it gave you a certain amount of protection because you could hide and get out of, out of the way. </sentence><sentence id="391">And that certainly helped me, in some instances, to survive. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="413">Q: Can you tell me what working in a <span class="building">laundry</span> consisted of? </sentence><sentence id="414">I mean, you survived this way. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="417">What did you do there? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="418">A: One of the things that I had to do was to go and fetch gas. </sentence><sentence id="419">Not very often, but I think two or three times -- the same gas that was used for the gassing of people -- this Zyklon C gas(r) --to pick it up, for disinfecting purposes, from the <span class="building">crematorium</span> to the, to the <span class="building">laundry</span>. </sentence><sentence id="420">And that was, and that actually enabled me to go to get out of the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="421">But basically, just go deliver a piece of paper from one place to another, and hang around. </sentence><sentence id="422">I certainly didn't work very hard. </sentence><sentence id="423">It wasn't, it wasn't a full-time job. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="430">Q: In carrying the gas, did you know that it was the same kind of gas? </sentence><sentence id="431">Did you make a connection? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="434">A: Oh, yes. </sentence><sentence id="435">You, you couldn't, you couldn't live in, in <span class="populated place">Birkenau</span> without knowing what the gas was for. </sentence><sentence id="436">You have to visualize it. </sentence><sentence id="437">In the, in the <span class="populated place">Gypsy camp</span> -- that is to say, in the--each -- there were a number of <span class="populated place">camps</span> in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, in <span class="populated place">Birkenau</span>. </sentence><sentence id="438">They were basically <span class="dlf">streets</span> with <span class="building">barracks</span> on each side surrounded by <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span>, and there was <span class="populated place">Camp D</span> and C and B, and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="439">The, the <span class="interior space">gas chambers</span> and <span class="building">crematories</span> were at one side. </sentence><sentence id="440">You could stand, for example, outside your <span class="building">barracks</span> in my <span class="populated place">camp</span>, and see the smoke billowing out from the, from 8 Zyklon B.  the <span class="building">crematory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="441">And not only the smoke, and even almost fire, but also the stench that would come out. </sentence><sentence id="442">So you couldn't be in any place in that <span class="env feature">environment</span> and not know what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="443">And, of course, it was close enough almost to hear the screaming of, of people "cause what happened usually, unlike in my case, people would come to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> at the <span class="building">railroad station</span>, at the -- would be unloaded and there separated -- one group going into the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, being allowed to go into the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, and the others going directly to the <span class="interior space">gas chambers</span> and the, and the <span class="building">crematory</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="455">Q: Did you watch this often? </sentence><sentence id="456">Were you in a position to see this process? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="459">A: You --I could see it. </sentence><sentence id="460">To say that I watched it... You, you couldn't help but know what was going, going on. </sentence><sentence id="461">And as a matter of fact, towards the end, when I was -- at the very end, when the <span class="building">crematory</span> no longer functioned, we were struck at one point that that suddenly there were birds and other things. </sentence><sentence id="462">There, there was nothing before. </sentence><sentence id="463">It was really sort of a, a <span class="env feature">cloud</span> hanging over the over the place. </sentence><sentence id="464">I was at one point, I was -- later on -- sort of taking the story forward -- I was in a <span class="populated place">camp</span> that was even closer to the <span class="interior space">gas chambers</span> and the <span class="building">crematory</span>, where you could really hear the screaming almost on a...on a regular basis. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="471">Q: Tell me about your parents at this point. </sentence><sentence id="472">You're in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="473">You were with your father? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="477">What happened to your parents? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="478">A: When we came into <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, my father and I were separated from my mother. </sentence><sentence id="479">My mother was sent to the <span class="populated place">women's camp</span> in, in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, and my father and I were sent together to the, to the <span class="populated place">Gypsy camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="480">I saw my mother once during that, that period. </sentence><sentence id="481">I was able -- I was sent on some -- or had to go for something to the <span class="populated place">women's camp</span>; and went just so I could, could see my mother, and we had -- there were systems in which you could get some messages through from one group to the other. </sentence><sentence id="482">But otherwise there were just my, my father and I. We were, we were separated, I think, in October of 1944 or, or later-- when there was another, when there was a Selektion. </sentence><sentence id="483">And that was the only time when I wasn't able to escape. </sentence><sentence id="484">I -- there were many instances where | avoided the <span class="building">crematorium</span> throughout that period of stay in, in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>; but that was the only time when, when I lost. </sentence><sentence id="485">I'd always taken this as sort of a battle between them and us. </sentence><sentence id="486">And I'd always won; because I was never caught up in any Selektion. </sentence><sentence id="487">I was always able to escape. </sentence><sentence id="488">But in the last one, my, my father and I, we -- there was a Selektion of people to be sent out to another place, another <span class="populated place">camp</span>, in <span class="country">Germany</span> for work purposes. </sentence><sentence id="489">And Mengele" and a group of, of doctors were lined up. </sentence><sentence id="490">And they saw me as a child, and they motioned me to go one way, and my father go the other way. </sentence><sentence id="491">And that's the last I saw of my, my father. </sentence><sentence id="492">I was retained in the, in the <span class="building">barracks</span>, where we were supposed to then be taken from there to the, to the <span class="interior space">gas chamber</span>. </sentence><sentence id="493">I knew that you deg Josef Mengele (1911-19797), extermination camp doctor at <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="494"> couldn't -- you develop all kinds of expertise as a, as a child growing up. </sentence><sentence id="495">I tried to escape a number of times -- couldn't, was caught, was beaten and gave up. </sentence><sentence id="496">At that point, I figured there was, there was no way. </sentence><sentence id="497">And I'd tried my best, but it was the end. </sentence><sentence id="498">What saved me was the fact that there weren't enough people to take to the <span class="interior space">gas chambers</span>. </sentence><sentence id="499">They made a decision to take us to the <span class="interior space">sick ward</span>, instead, until they had a larger <span class="spatial object">transport</span>. </sentence><sentence id="500">And that's what they did. </sentence><sentence id="501">They took us to, to <span class="building">barracks</span> in another <span class="populated place">camp</span>, which is the <span class="populated place">camp</span> closer to the <span class="building">crematorium</span>," where all of the people had this serious skin disease. </sentence><sentence id="502">It was -- in, in German it was called "<span class="building">Kritze</span>""." </sentence><sentence id="503">| don't know what it is in English, and I didn't develop it. </sentence><sentence id="504">There was a young Polish doctor, who kept giving me alcohol and other things, and told me what to do. </sentence><sentence id="505">One morning, I, I woke up. </sentence><sentence id="506">I -- it was very difficult in that place to sort of separate nightmares from reality, because you heard the noises all the time. </sentence><sentence id="507">One morning, I woke up and the people I had come with were all gone. </sentence><sentence id="508">And what had happened was that the Polish doctor had torn up card with my name on it, which had a ""X" in back, which meant that I was supposed to go. </sentence><sentence id="509">All the other people were taken out to the <span class="interior space">gas chamber</span>, and I -- he had written a new card for me, and I was saved. </sentence><sentence id="510">And so...From there, then, I went -- was able to get out of that <span class="populated place">camp</span> -- with the help, curiously enough, of a German--to, to a <span class="populated place">work camp</span> back in, in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
