<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3">A: My name is Leonard Zawacki and I was born on January the 20, 1916 in the <span class="populated place">town</span> of Grujand(ph) which at that time was under the German occupation. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5">Q: Tell me a little tiny bit about your childhood. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7">A: Well, I went to <span class="building">school</span> in my <span class="populated place">hometown</span> and I finished, graduated from the <span class="building">high school</span> which we called <span class="building">gymnasium</span>, and after the graduation I enlisted into the <span class="building">School of Foreign Trade</span> in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="8">And in 1938 I was called up to the Polish Army and as a graduate of <span class="building">gymnasium</span> I only had to serve one year, and you served in <span class="building">cadet officers school</span>, <span class="building">reserve cadet officers school</span>, which I did. </sentence><sentence id="9">And I was supposed to be released in October 1939 and as you probably know the war started on September 1, "39 and I took part in the fighting. </sentence><sentence id="10">I was assigned to a unit of antitank artillery and I took part in the defense of <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>, and on September 27 <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> surrendered, and I was taken as a prisoner of war and taken out first, out of <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> on the 28 of September to the <span class="region">west</span>, and near a small <span class="populated place">town</span> of <span class="populated place">Prostejov</span> where we were kept, you know, thousands of soldiers in an open <span class="dlf">field</span> and <span class="env feature">meadows</span> and then divided in four groups; south, north, east and west, and since I came from the north I went to the north group, and we were loaded then on <span class="spatial object">tanks</span> and taken to the north, and we came to the <span class="populated place">town</span> of <span class="populated place">Torun</span>, which is a <span class="populated place">town</span> some 40 miles south of my <span class="populated place">hometown</span>, and there we were taken and unloaded and then taken to the other side of the Vistul </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="11">A: We came, arrived at the <span class="region">western part</span> of the <span class="env feature">Vistula River</span> and the two <span class="dlf">bridges</span> which were across the <span class="env feature">Vistula</span> were both damaged, and we had to walk single file to across the other side of the <span class="env feature">river</span>. </sentence><sentence id="12">And there we were again assembled and we were supposed to go to the <span class="building">citadel</span> where they told us that we were only go to stay overnight and the next morning they were going to release us. </sentence><sentence id="13">Of course, I realized that this was a lie, as most of the things they told us, and I, myself, separated myself from -- I asked the guard if I could go to the <span class="spatial object">toilet</span> because we were near the <span class="building">station</span> in <span class="populated place">Torun</span> and he said yes. </sentence><sentence id="14">I went to the <span class="spatial object">toilet</span> and I didn't return to it. </sentence><sentence id="15">He saw me going away and he said, where are you going? </sentence><sentence id="16">And I said, well, my troops assemble at the other part of the <span class="building">station</span> and I have to -- and I think he realized that I was running away but he let me go. </sentence><sentence id="17">So I went to the other <span class="building">station</span>, and there quite accidently I met my cousin, who never did serve in the Armed Forces, but he was in a uniform, a soldiers uniform and we got together, and somehow he was able to secure some blank forms which were given to people who considered themselves of German origin, and they were issued these passes and he had the blank forms. </sentence><sentence id="18">So we filled them out with our names and signed some fictitious names to it. </sentence><sentence id="19">Of course, we didn't have any stamps. </sentence><sentence id="20">Anyway, we boarded the <span class="spatial object">train</span> to our <span class="populated place">hometown</span> and we arrived around midnight in my <span class="populated place">hometown</span>, and at the <span class="dlf">exit</span> all the passes were checked and there were the SS people and the SR people and the Armed Forces people, and when they This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="21">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="22"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection looked at our passes they told us to step aside. </sentence><sentence id="23">We stepped aside and then they gathered us. </sentence><sentence id="24">I think there were 11 of us or so and they said, well, again you have to go to the <span class="building">citadel</span> overnight and then in the morning we going to release you. </sentence><sentence id="25">Of course, we knew better than that. </sentence><sentence id="26">So they marched us from the <span class="building">station</span>, and my cousin was an owner of a <span class="dlf">lumber yard</span> and we had to pass near the <span class="building">lumber yard</span>, and he told the guard -- we were in the last <span class="interior space">row</span> and he told, he looked, still my name on the -- my firm name, and why do you want me to go to the <span class="building">citadel</span> for the night if I could sleep at <span class="building">home</span>? </sentence><sentence id="27">And he said, all right. </sentence><sentence id="28">Go ahead. </sentence><sentence id="29">And then I told him, well, it's my cousin, can I stay with him there too?And he said already, go. </sentence><sentence id="30">And we went and that's how we got away from being prisoner of war and spending the rest of the war. </sentence><sentence id="31">So I stayed overnight and the next morning I went <span class="building">home</span> and-- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="56">Q: Let's back up. </sentence><sentence id="57">Why do you think he did that? </sentence><sentence id="58">Why do you think he let you go? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="62">A: Well, I suppose because first of all we spoke German to him. </sentence><sentence id="63">We both did speak German and we more or less pleaded and -- I don't know who the man was. </sentence><sentence id="64">Maybe he was a local man. </sentence><sentence id="65">Maybe he knew us or at least he knew my cousin. </sentence><sentence id="66">Anyway, it seems that well he had some kind of feeling that he let us go. </sentence><sentence id="67">I don't know and I don't know who he was or what. </sentence><sentence id="68">But anyway, he did let us go. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="76">Q: And one other question was that whole period -- what was it like? </sentence><sentence id="77">Was it very disorganized? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="80">A: Well no, no, it was not. </sentence><sentence id="81">The Germans were not disorganized. </sentence><sentence id="82">It was very -- the terror was right from the first day, the Germans came, they started terrorizing people. </sentence><sentence id="83">Matter of fact, some of my relatives who belonged to organizations which the German thought were unfriendly to them, they were arrested right on the spot and taken into the <span class="env feature">forest</span> and shot on the spot and all trace disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="84">So the terror was there right from the first day of occupation. </sentence><sentence id="85">And why he did this I couldn't tell. </sentence><sentence id="86">Well, I can go further, and that was when I came <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="87">It was in October in "39, and I think after three weeks I was arrested. </sentence><sentence id="88">Not myself, with some other friends of mine, students. </sentence><sentence id="89">I was arrested by the local Germans who formed special units, protective units. </sentence><sentence id="90">They called -- the German name was  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="91"> straw on the sides of the <span class="interior space">room</span> on which we for the night spread, and we had to lay on this straw. </sentence><sentence id="92">We had no blankets or anything. </sentence><sentence id="93">We were allowed, after a few days, we were allowed to contact our parents and our families and they could deliver to us food, because they didn't supply any food. </sentence><sentence id="94">I stayed there for three weeks and only because a friend of mine who knew -- who had a German friend who was associated with some German organization. </sentence><sentence id="95">Matter of fact, he studied journalism in <span class="country">Germany</span> in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> and, after he finished his studies he became a member of the <span class="building">propaganda ministry</span> propaganda  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="96"> went to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="97">And of course, I didn't have much means, you know, of supporting myself. </sentence><sentence id="98">My cousin being in the <span class="building">business</span>, you know, had some savings and we lived together in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> for time being. </sentence><sentence id="99">In the meantime, he was trying to recover his <span class="dlf">property</span> which he eventually didn't recover but they permitted him to go back, and he could run it because, you know, he knew how to run the <span class="building">business</span>, and apparently the owner or the, what they called troyhander (ph) it means a man of who was, can't find the proper name of it, but anyway, somebody who was taking his, you know, and running the <span class="building">business</span> apparently didn't do a good job, and he was eventually able to get the job back, not as an owner but as a manager, and he went back and I stayed in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="100">In the meantime, I did join, you know, the underground movement. </sentence><sentence id="101">It started -- the first organization was called <span class="building">Zydowska Organizacja Bojow</span> </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="102">A: <span class="building">ZWZ</span> was the abbreviation, which later became the <span class="building">Home Army</span>. </sentence><sentence id="103">The Army of Kroiova(ph), which was the army which was supported by the legitimate government, which was at that time was already in <span class="populated place">London</span>, and I was arrested on the 31 of October 1940. </sentence><sentence id="104">At that time -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="108">Q: Before you go to that -- how did you find out about the underground movement? </sentence><sentence id="109">Tell me a little bit more about that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="112">A: Well, I had a friend -- a friend who his name was Tobulsky(ph). </sentence><sentence id="113">That's also was one reason why I was arrested, and he was also from my <span class="populated place">hometown</span> in <span class="populated place">Grujand</span> and, he was involved in an organization which was formed by one also a student in my <span class="populated place">hometown</span> which he joined. </sentence><sentence id="114">I didn't join because I wasn't there already, and they joined this organization and he wasn't caught, but the principal of the organization was caught, and he was tried and then convicted, you know, and sentenced to death. </sentence><sentence id="115">And he was executed in <span class="populated place">Poz</span> -- which was another quite a big <span class="populated place">city</span> which was incorporated in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="116">And the executioned at that time was my -- he was -- they chopped you know his head off with an axe. </sentence><sentence id="117">He was axed, and this friend of mine, since he escaped and he came to the <span class="building">General Government</span> to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>, was tried in that and he was also sentenced to death. </sentence><sentence id="118">And  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection you know and for arms. </sentence><sentence id="119">Well, they didn't find it either because I didn't keep anything at <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="120">Anyway, then they started asking me questions and one question was that your friend was here with you yesterday. </sentence><sentence id="121">And they -- apparently he changed his name and he failed to tell me about it. </sentence><sentence id="122">I knew him only by his new name, and so when they asked me was Tobulksy (ph) you know that was his assumed name, I said no, so they hit me. </sentence><sentence id="123">You know, you can see it here on the movies you know with the hand across there. </sentence><sentence id="124">Hit me right in my <span class="building">temple</span> and I fell to the <span class="interior space">floor</span>, and as I fell to the <span class="interior space">floor</span>, they started, the three of them started kicking me and I said -- I remember the only person who visited me was this young Tobulsky and I told them his real name. </sentence><sentence id="125">Apparently, they knew this and they stopped beating me, I got up, and after a while they had a small conference between the three of them and then they came back and said, you better get dressed and you will go with us. </sentence><sentence id="126">So I got dressed and then they took me out, and the two of them held me by the cuffs of my jacket and they walked on both sides. </sentence><sentence id="127">And this one in the uniform drew his revolver and walked behind me, and he told me, don't try anything because I'm going to shoot you. </sentence><sentence id="128">So they took me down through the <span class="dlf">street</span> and there was a <span class="spatial object">car</span> waiting, <span class="spatial object">Mercedes</span> -- they only drove <span class="spatial object">Mercedes</span> -- and they opened the <span class="dlf">door</span>, and as they opened the <span class="dlf">door</span> I saw another friend of mine sitting there, and he said, oh, you know each other. </sentence><sentence id="129">And I said, yes, I do, and they told me to get in. </sentence><sentence id="130">And one of the <span class="spatial object">SS</span> sat between the two of us and their chauffeur. </sentence><sentence id="131">They drove me to the <span class="building">prison</span>, <span class="building">prison Pawiak</span> in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>, and then approximately, already ten people from other prisoners, and they were registered and then taken -- I was taken to a single <span class="interior space">cell</span> in the <span class="interior space">basement</span> and there was no -- it was only a small bulb. </sentence><sentence id="132">There was no <span class="spatial object">furniture</span>. </sentence><sentence id="133">There was no <span class="dlf">window</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="134">It was a <span class="interior space">dirt floor</span>, and the <span class="dlf">walls</span> were dripping with water, and there was only a <span class="spatial object">pail</span> which you used as a <span class="spatial object">toilet</span>. </sentence><sentence id="135">And when I came there I didn't really know what happened. </sentence><sentence id="136">After a while a guard came and took me out and into the <span class="dlf">yard</span> and to the <span class="interior space">showers</span>. </sentence><sentence id="137">I had to undress and my clothes were disinfected and I had to <span class="interior space">shower</span>. </sentence><sentence id="138">And then after the clothes came back, my suit and so on, was all trampled they took me -- the guard took me to the first -- no, second <span class="interior space">floor</span> of the <span class="building">prison</span> and took me to a <span class="interior space">cell</span>. </sentence><sentence id="139">I don't remember the number of the <span class="interior space">cell</span>. </sentence><sentence id="140">Anyway, the <span class="interior space">cells</span> were small. </sentence><sentence id="141">They were maybe seven feet wide and ten feet long, and there were already nine prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="142">Which means, there were ten of us. </sentence><sentence id="143">There was no <span class="spatial object">bunk</span> or anything. </sentence><sentence id="144">We had to lie on the <span class="interior space">floor</span>. </sentence><sentence id="145">Again, there was no <span class="spatial object">furniture</span> whatsoever except the <span class="spatial object">pail</span> where we could relieve ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="146">We were only taken in the morning to the <span class="interior space">toilets</span> where we could wash a little, and I think in the afternoon once and in the evening, and the rest we had to spend in the <span class="interior space">cells</span>. </sentence><sentence id="147">At that time there were Polish guards, you know, prewar Polish guards as were as Germans, SS people, and some of the Polish guards were very friendly and pleasant and helpful. </sentence><sentence id="148">Some were not so helpful. </sentence><sentence id="149">Anyway, one of the guards in my -- I don't know how he found out -- but he found out that I do speak German, and one day he asked me -- apparently he was living in a <span class="building">house</span> which was <span class="building">Jewish-owned house</span>, and it was requisitioned by the government and the Germans and apparently, whoever took over from the Germans wanted to increase his rent and he asked me, he said, on the salary which they pay me, I won't be able to pay the rent for it. </sentence><sentence id="150">And he asked me if I could write a -- how do you say -- an application to the authorities, you know, whereby they wouldn't increase his rent. </sentence><sentence id="151">So I did. </sentence><sentence id="152">He took me to the <span class="building">office</span> and I did write the letter, and after a few weeks he got a reply. </sentence><sentence id="153">And they didn't increase -- not This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="154">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="155"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection only didn't they increase. </sentence><sentence id="156">Matter of fact, they reduced his rent. </sentence><sentence id="157">So he was very appreciative and he said what can I do for you, and of course, I wanted to tell him, let me go free from the <span class="building">prison</span>, but he said, what I can do for you, I can take you out of the <span class="interior space">cell</span>. </sentence><sentence id="158">Since you do speak German you can be an interpreter, and he took me to another part of the <span class="building">prison</span> to another <span class="interior space">ward</span> which was served only by German guard. </sentence><sentence id="159">And there I became an interpreter to this German guard, and of course, my life was a little easier because I was with four other prisoners in one <span class="interior space">cell</span> and we also had <span class="spatial object">bunks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="160">I didn't have to sleep on the <span class="interior space">floor</span>. </sentence><sentence id="161">And two of the prisoners, who lived also in this <span class="interior space">cell</span>, they worked in the <span class="interior space">prison kitchen</span> and as such they were able to -- well, they had more food but they were not allowed -- they couldn't and they were afraid to bring any food, but what they did bring they brought always in the evening to the <span class="interior space">cell</span>, whole pot of coffee. </sentence><sentence id="162">And the coffee was so sweet. </sentence><sentence id="163">They probably put pounds of sugar in it. </sentence><sentence id="164">So we drank this coffee, this sweet coffee, which was not real coffee because the Germans, they wouldn't give the prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="165">It was such a good coffee. </sentence><sentence id="166">Anyway, it looked like coffee and the sugar of course was very important. </sentence><sentence id="167">So I felt I could move free because they didn't close the <span class="interior space">cell</span>, and whenever the guard needed me to translate. </sentence><sentence id="168">And so I did translate and in the meantime, I was taking for interrogation. </sentence><sentence id="169">You were interrogated in the <span class="building">headquarters</span> of the Gestapo which was in the central part of <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>, and you were taken there by a <span class="spatial object">truck</span>. </sentence><sentence id="170">And the guards were in the <span class="spatial object">truck</span> as well, as motorcycle guards as well as going behind the <span class="spatial object">truck</span> and when you came to the <span class="building">Gestapo headquarters</span>, which were now located in the prewar <span class="building">Polish Educational Ministry</span>, and one of the <span class="interior space">wings</span> was converted. </sentence><sentence id="171">The <span class="interior space">southern wing</span> was converted into <span class="interior space">cells</span> where the prisoners, before they went for interrogation, were taken. </sentence><sentence id="172">There were ten individual <span class="interior space">cells</span> and four, I believe four, <span class="interior space">common cells</span> and the <span class="interior space">common cells</span>, we -- the prisoners called them <span class="spatial object">trams</span> because they were single <span class="spatial object">seats</span> on each side of the <span class="interior space">cell</span>, and in the middle there was a <span class="dlf">walking path</span> and you had to sit facing the <span class="dlf">wall</span> and you were not allowed to look around or you couldn't talk to you, and the guard was behind you and if he heard you talk or move your head, he came and hit you over the head. </sentence><sentence id="173">And you sat there motionless. </sentence><sentence id="174">You didn't get any food or anything to drink, and they called when the interrogating officer called. </sentence><sentence id="175">A guard came and took you up to the <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="176">I was taken to the <span class="interior space">room</span>, and in the <span class="interior space">room</span> there were this interrogating officer who was now in uniform. </sentence><sentence id="177">When he arrested me, he was one arresting, he was in civilian clothes. </sentence><sentence id="178">He was an officer of the Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="179">And there was a typist, a girl and interpreter. </sentence><sentence id="180">Since he knew -- the interrogating officer knew that I spoke German -- he was very rude matter of fact, to the interpreter. </sentence><sentence id="181">He told him get lost, you know, he speaks German, so we don't need you here. </sentence><sentence id="182">And then he started interrogating, questioning. </sentence><sentence id="183">Actually, they didn't have anything, you know, which they could hang on me. </sentence><sentence id="184">They didn't find any <span class="spatial object">leaflet</span>. </sentence><sentence id="185">They didn't find anything and I didn't admit that I was a member of the resistance movement and they didn't know that. </sentence><sentence id="186">The only thing they were about was a friend of mine and again, as I told them when they first arrested me. </sentence><sentence id="187">And so it was typed and then the typed report was given to me for reading. </sentence><sentence id="188">I read it through and then I had to sign it. </sentence><sentence id="189">I did sign it. </sentence><sentence id="190">Frankly, it was not incriminating to me at all except that I knew this fellow, and then he called the guard and the guard took me again down to the <span class="interior space">cellar</span> into this common <span class="interior space">cells</span> and I had to sit until all the prisoners were interrogated. </sentence><sentence id="191">Sometimes, the interrogation went deep into the night and sometimes until the next morning of the other prisoners, and you had to sit This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="192">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="193"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection there until they took you back or they loaded you back into the <span class="spatial object">truck</span> and then they took you to the <span class="building">prison</span>. </sentence><sentence id="194">So I was taken in the late afternoon back to the <span class="building">prison</span>. </sentence><sentence id="195">In the meantime, you missed your food. </sentence><sentence id="196">You didn't get any food in the <span class="building">prison</span>. </sentence><sentence id="197">The food was meager as it was but anyway, I still didn't get anything that day to eat. </sentence><sentence id="198">I can tell you one incident when I was awakened in the middle of the night by a Gestapo man. </sentence><sentence id="199">They came to our <span class="interior space">ward</span> and they woke me up, and I had to interpret and they called 20 names out of different <span class="interior space">cells</span>. </sentence><sentence id="200">And these were hostages and I think some of them knew what the fate which they faced. </sentence><sentence id="201">Most of them were very well educated. </sentence><sentence id="202">Some were professors of the <span class="building">Warsaw University</span>. </sentence><sentence id="203">Some were engineers and only one, I remember, was a criminal prisoner, and all of them behaved with tremendous dignity. </sentence><sentence id="204">They didn't plead or beg or anything except this criminal prisoner. </sentence><sentence id="205">He fell to the <span class="interior space">floor</span> and begged to the SS man, kissed his boots, you know that, to spare him. </sentence><sentence id="206">Of course, they wouldn't have anything of it. </sentence><sentence id="207">And I had to interpret and they were taken, and they were taken outside to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> and shot as hostages. </sentence><sentence id="208">So thats the one experience I had in <span class="building">prison</span>. </sentence><sentence id="209">I spent five months in the <span class="building">prison</span> in <span class="building">Pawiak prison</span>. </sentence><sentence id="210">During that time I had a girlfriend whom I left who of course, was not arrested -- and somehow she managed to send me a <span class="spatial object">parcel</span>, and how I knew that the parcel was from her because I couldn't communicate. </sentence><sentence id="211">You couldn't write any letters or anything like this. </sentence><sentence id="212">You could only send letters if a guard would take them on the sly, but otherwise there was no, no possibility of communicating. </sentence><sentence id="213">But I know that this what is from my girlfriend because she send me also a small <span class="spatial object">pillow</span>, and I recognized the <span class="spatial object">pillow</span> that it was from her, and she sent me some food. </sentence><sentence id="214">But the food was always shared with others and before it came

and some Polish prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="804">One day, it was of course after the invasion of <span class="country">Russia</span> by Hitler, I think it was approximately on, in September, I think, September of 1941. </sentence><sentence id="805">We were all called back from our <span class="building">workplaces</span> to the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="806">Maybe I should also explain how the compound itself was only for the prisoners to go for the night to sleep, and the compound -

yes - so we were all brought back to the <span class="populated place">camp</span> one afternoon, and we had to go on the <span class="dlf">blocks</span> and they told us that we, nobody can go to the <span class="dlf">windows</span> and look out the <span class="dlf">windows</span>. </sentence><sentence id="809">Anybody who will be caught will be killed and the guards were all over the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, and we didn't know what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="810">We found out later on the next days because the pallbearers told us, you know, there were prisoners who had to remove the bodies and apparently, 600 Russian prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="811">And I don't know, I think they were all officers and most of them probably were all political commisars [ph] and they were taken to <span class="dlf">Block 11</span>, the <span class="dlf">death block</span>, and they were put into the <span class="interior space">cellars</span> and the <span class="interior space">cellars</span> were sealed off. </sentence><sentence id="812">There were half <span class="dlf">windows</span> and the half <span class="dlf">windows</span> were covered with dirt in order to make them gas tight and they were gassed there. </sentence><sentence id="813">And in the night the bodies were removed by the pallbearers and taken to the <span class="building">crematorium</span> Number | in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> and they were burned. </sentence><sentence id="814">And from the pallbearers we learned that they were Russian officers or soldiers, and among them there were also some 200 Polish prisoners that were gassed. </sentence><sentence id="815">So that was the first gassing, as I, which was performed. </sentence><sentence id="816">Later on, there were gassings in the small <span class="interior space">gas chamber</span> in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> and I once was witness, I mean, not to the gassing itself because nobody -

think it because, you know, you were so hungry and you just couldn't gather your thoughts. </sentence><sentence id="1399">All you were thinking about how to survive. </sentence><sentence id="1400">But later on when I, more or less, became acquainted and I got together with a friend of mine and we were thinking about escaping, and we did have a plan and we did prepare for it. </sentence><sentence id="1401">And of course, the preparations were you had to do it with and had to involve many people and trust many people. </sentence><sentence id="1402">Now, in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> there were some crafts which couldn't be performed by prisoners because they were specialties things which had to be done. </sentence><sentence id="1403">And therefore, they did employ outside people from the Polish workers, and these workers were more or less free to mingle you know with the prisoners and some people did mingle with them and were able to talk and exchange information from the outside, and some of them were even able to send letters to their family from outside. </sentence><sentence id="1404">Some were caught and if the civilian person was caught, then they were brought to the <span class="populated place">camp</span> or they were executed right away. </sentence><sentence id="1405">So they were taking great chances. </sentence><sentence id="1406">But anyway, so we did - one of the fellows made the contact, there were four of us who planned to escape, and we wanted to escape as civilian workers and we did prepare, you know, the <span class="dlf">passes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1407">They were of course forged and our photographs were drawings you know and then taken - the photographs by a lens and somebody in a <span class="spatial object">box</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1408">Somebody brought a lens and we made a photograph of this drawings. </sentence><sentence id="1409">Not of us. </sentence><sentence id="1410">Couldn't be done. </sentence><sentence id="1411">And then that's what we put on the <span class="dlf">passes</span> and then the civilians also brought <span class="spatial object">bicycles</span>, and what they did, they came on a <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> and left the <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> in this spot. </sentence><sentence id="1412">It was in not carpentry. </sentence><sentence id="1413">It was in the <span class="building">joiners</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1414">There were small places where they could be hidden you know, in the <span class="building">joiners</span>, and they left them and they brought four because four of us wanted to escape, and they brought four <span class="spatial object">bikes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1415">They also brought four civilian clothes and they also - we were able to prepare toupees, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1416">They were very crudely made. </sentence><sentence id="1417">I don't know who made them, but anyway there were, and then we decided that we going to go out of the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1418">At that time when we planned, you know, there was no more collective responsibility. </sentence><sentence id="1419">In other words, nobody would have suffered because of our escape and that's what - we didn't want anybody to be starved to death because we escaped. </sentence><sentence id="1420">We didn't think in those terms. </sentence><sentence id="1421">We thought that if we do, we didn't want anybody to suffer for us. </sentence><sentence id="1422">So when the day came that we escaped, we wanted to go with the other workers and could mingle and go in one group and then show the passes. </sentence><sentence id="1423">And I'm sure the guards wouldn't check each pass separately, you know closely, and when the day and the time to quit, which was the worker had to leave by five o'clock, we went to the <span class="building">shed</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1424">It was a <span class="building">shed</span> where we changed the clothes, into the civilian, and this one fellow who actually made all the contacts with the civilians because he was in a position This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1425">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1426"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 4 to do it, he just didn't show up in the <span class="building">shed</span> to change. </sentence><sentence id="1427">So then one of my friends you know changed back into the <span class="building">prison</span> and went to see what is happening. </sentence><sentence id="1428">And then he came and he was shaking life a leaf and he just couldn't contain himself. </sentence><sentence id="1429">He was mumbling. </sentence><sentence id="1430">He said, I'm sorry I can't make it. </sentence><sentence id="1431">He said, I cannot do it, I just can't take the risk. </sentence><sentence id="1432">So then we had to abandon it. </sentence><sentence id="1433">And we again changed into our <span class="building">prison</span> garb, and now we were afraid about him, whether he is not going to you know to tell on us. </sentence><sentence id="1434">And we had to, well - we could have, if we wanted we could have eliminated him by - because of the lies, we could have infected him with typhus you know and he knew it and if he once he went to the <span class="building">hospital</span>, you know, the doctors were all Polish or Jewish and Czechs or what and they were friends of ours, they would have taken care of him. </sentence><sentence id="1435">But he promised us, he cannot do it but he is not going to do any harm to us if we want to go in a different way. </sentence><sentence id="1436">He said to trust him and we did. </sentence><sentence id="1437">We did trust him and we had to change our plans, and then apparently, apparently somebody must have known that we were planning to escape, and then the other group came and they approached us with - we wouldn't go in a different way, and the different way was to acquire SS uniforms and take prisoners out to work outside the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1438">And that's how we started planning, and some of the people who were involved had connections. </sentence><sentence id="1439">One of the prisoners had connections with the people, because everywhere I worked were prisoners, everywhere. </sentence><sentence id="1440">Only the top authorities were the Germans, but otherwise, the inside organization of it was all, in the prisoners hands. </sentence><sentence id="1441">There were all in the <span class="building">offices</span>, everything. </sentence><sentence id="1442">The whole evidence, everything, was kept by the prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="1443">Doctors, you know, everything. </sentence><sentence id="1444">So we decided that we do escape as SS guards and take four prisoners out to work, outside the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1445">And since my friend and myself spoke quite decent German, we were picked to be the SS people. </sentence><sentence id="1446">And then some of the friends who were involved had friends who worked in the <span class="interior space">storage rooms</span> where they stored the SS uniforms and they were able to smuggle out of the <span class="interior space">storage rooms</span> one pair of trousers and then second pair of trousers, and then one jacket and another one, then a cap, then second cap, then the belt, then second belt, and this was brought in and it was stored, you know, my friends who was supposed to change in the SS uniform with me who had a small <span class="interior space">studio</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1447">He was a carver and a sculptor and he had a small <span class="interior space">studio</span>, and he was not bothered by anybody, by the SS, because he worked for them. </sentence><sentence id="1448">He sculpted things for them for which they sometimes give him some bread and some sausage and, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1449">And they took these things and probably sold it or kept it, sent it to <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1450">So we stored it in his small <span class="interior space">studio</span>, and then when the time came to escape, then we transferred it to the <span class="dlf">lumber yard</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1451">Actually, it was not only a <span class="interior space">lumber yard</span> but it was all the building materials were stored, in this place. </sentence><sentence id="1452">It was called <span class="populated place">Bowhov</span> [?] </sentence><sentence id="1453">and in the <span class="building">barrack</span> where the lumber was kept there were three friends of ours and they hid the uniforms there. </sentence><sentence id="1454">And these uniforms, they then put the insignia because we didn't want to go out as just ordinary SS men. </sentence><sentence id="1455">We wanted to go as NCOs in order that we were able to carry sidearms. </sentence><sentence id="1456">Of course, any SS man who was taking out people to work outside, you know, had to be armed. </sentence><sentence id="1457">Not only armed, had to have a special permit, but I'll come back later to it. </sentence><sentence id="1458">The arms of course, was an impossibility for us to obtain, but we again, had friends who worked in the <span class="building">saddlery</span> that, you know, <span class="building">workshops</span>, and we were able to obtain two holsters for which we then made dummy pistols out of wood. </sentence><sentence id="1459">Now, one of our friends knew somebody in the <span class="building">saddlery</span> and he approached him with a concocted story that the chief of the carpenters and workshops, who was an SS man by the name of [fred Shiner [ph] had his birthday coming up, and his <span class="spatial object">holster</span> was rather This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1460">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1461"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 5 shabby, and whether he wouldn't make a new <span class="spatial object">holster</span> for him. </sentence><sentence id="1462">The fellow said, yes. </sentence><sentence id="1463">Of course, everything was done for a piece of bread or piece of sausage if you could obtain it. </sentence><sentence id="1464">And he said, yes he will do it, but what size is the <span class="spatial object">pistol</span>? </sentence><sentence id="1465">We said, well, we can't ask him to give us the pistol so that you can make the <span class="spatial object">holster</span> we said the normal size, just make one. </sentence><sentence id="1466">So he said Okay, but don't blame me if it doesn't fit. </sentence><sentence id="1467">But of course that was the whole idea, that it wouldn't fit because we needed two. </sentence><sentence id="1468">So no matter what he do it wouldn't be the right size. </sentence><sentence id="1469">So he made this one <span class="spatial object">holster</span>, and we told him no, I'm sorry, it is too small. </sentence><sentence id="1470">Will you make a larger one? </sentence><sentence id="1471">Again, for a piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="1472">So he made another one and then we had the two <span class="spatial object">holsters</span>, and as I said, for the two <span class="spatial object">holsters</span>, we sculptured and made dummy out of wood, dummy pistols. </sentence><sentence id="1473">The pistol's <span class="spatial object">holsters</span> were open in the <span class="interior space">back</span> and of course, you could see, you know, whether there were a real pistol or not. </sentence><sentence id="1474">But since <span class="populated place">camp</span>, especially in the winter, was rather damp place - <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> was a damp place, so the SS always wrapped the back of the pistol in a dark cloth, black cloth, you know, piece of cloth so that you couldn't see from the back whether it was a real pistol or not. </sentence><sentence id="1475">So we did the same thing and nobody knew whether there was a real pistol or not. </sentence><sentence id="1476">Then the SS needed a pass to take prisoners out to work and the passes were issued by the issuing SS officer, and they were of different color for different days and again, one of our fellows who were escaping with us knew a fellow prisoner who worked in the <span class="building">printing office</span> and the <span class="spatial object">printer</span> gave him some blank forms in different colors. </sentence><sentence id="1477">Now, the day we wanted to escape which was, matter of fact, it will be in six days. </sentence><sentence id="1478">It will be the 50" anniversary, on the 28 of September, 1944. </sentence><sentence id="1479">And when we came to issue this blanks - the colors was pale blue - and we looked through our <span class="spatial object">blanks</span> and we didn't have a pale blue. </sentence><sentence id="1480">The nearest to it was pale green and we said well we'll take the pale green. </sentence><sentence id="1481">We take a chance. </sentence><sentence id="1482">So I knew who the issuing officer was and I did it in my <span class="building">office</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1483">Of course, we needed a <span class="spatial object">stamp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1484">The stamp - again, the sculptor, the carver, he carved it out, the stamp out of a very soft wood and he made a very good facsimile of it, and I tested it on a piece of paper in my <span class="building">office</span> on an ink pad and it came a very good facsimile. </sentence><sentence id="1485">So then I did fill out on the 28" I did fill out this pass and I signed, forged the name of the issuing officer who was the SS ? </sentence><sentence id="1486">De Fuhrer, Miller, signed his name, put the stamp, and in order that the stamp wouldn't be recognized, you know, I smudged it a little. </sentence><sentence id="1487">And then the prisoners themselves needed a permit from the <span class="building">workshop</span> SS man and this was no problem because one of the escapees was a clerk in the <span class="building">office</span> there, and he had blanks and he issued the blanks that four prisoners, glassers are going to work in this spot and he signed this SS man, forged his name. </sentence><sentence id="1488">So we had these two pieces of <span class="dlf">passes</span> which we needed. </sentence><sentence id="1489">Then we obtained, because if we failed, we obtained some cyanide poison. </sentence><sentence id="1490">We obtained it from the <span class="building">pharmacy</span>, the <span class="building">camp pharmacy</span>, which again, was run by prisoners, and the prisoners who did run it was named Marion Dolinski [ph] and he was a very nice fellow and he gave us cyanide in the form of powder, which we put, wrapped in pieces of paper and each one of us had it with him. </sentence><sentence id="1491">So then, now, before that we already had contact with the underground, and we had the contact with the underground through a Polish girl who worked as a SS civilian cleaning woman in the <span class="building">barracks</span> of the national labor social - NSDRP, I don't know what the - that's the acronym of the German Nazi party - and through her we contacted with the underground and the resistance movement. </sentence><sentence id="1492">And how we did contact her is that again, she was instructed to do some damage, either to the plumbing or to the electricity or something that broke down and that the workers had to come and to correct it. </sentence><sentence id="1493">And of course, whenever we needed This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1494">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1495"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 6 something and there was a call, then this fellow who worked in the <span class="building">workshop office</span> always assigned somebody, either himself to do it with another mechanic to go there or I went there, and he made the contact. </sentence><sentence id="1496">We exchanged the information with the girl and she took it to the - so with her we decided that we escape on the 28 of September 1944 and that - how do you say, the word you know, the recognition? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1607">Q: Password? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1609">A: Password will be a Polish carol, which the fellow who is going to meet us was supposed to whistle. </sentence><sentence id="1610">And the carol, Polish carol name was "" ? " </sentence><sentence id="1611">which means "They came to <span class="populated place">Bethlehem</span>." </sentence><sentence id="1612">So then everything was ready for us to go, and since we didn't have the proper color pass we said that we will try to avoid going through the <span class="dlf">gates</span> where the passes would be checked. </sentence><sentence id="1613">And we already surveyed it beforehand, that there to the <span class="building">buildings</span> to which we had to go to do to put the panes in you know, the panes, the glasspanes in, was there was a <span class="dlf">shortcut</span> which led under the <span class="building">tower</span> of a guard. </sentence><sentence id="1614">And many workers pass this way many times and they were never stopped. </sentence><sentence id="1615">So we said that we will try to do the same things, and we had a lookout for us, a fellow prisoner, a very good friend of us who was looking at the place, and he was supposed to give us the sign you know whether it's okay or not okay. </sentence><sentence id="1616">Anyway, so when the day came and we decided to escape at noontime, it was the time when the SS, most of them went to the <span class="interior space">mess hall</span> you know, for lunch and there wouldn't be too much of them moving around. </sentence><sentence id="1617">Because we had quite a distance to walk to meet our prisoners, you know, whom we were taking out to work and they were quite a distance away. </sentence><sentence id="1618">So when the day came at noontime, at one o'clock it so happened that the SS man who was in charge of me and the <span class="building">workshops</span> came to my <span class="building">office</span>, and he wanted something urgently done and it took sometime and I was delayed. </sentence><sentence id="1619">Eventually, he did leave and he went to lunch, and then I was able to leave and I went to meet my friend, the other one who was supposed to change into the SS clothes, and we went to the <span class="dlf">lumber yard</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1620">Because in the meantime, we transferred it to the <span class="building">lumber yard</span>, the uniforms, we went there and these people were quite worried that we were late, and they thought matter of fact that we won't show up at all. </sentence><sentence id="1621">But anyway we did come, and we changed into the uniforms you know and they inspected us. </sentence><sentence id="1622">They were supposed to then, after we were successful in escaping, they would burn our <span class="building">prison</span> uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="1623">They inspected us and they looked out of the <span class="building">barrack</span> whether the <span class="env feature">air</span> was clear and they told us yes, and we walked out. </sentence><sentence id="1624">And as I said, we had to walk approximately some, almost half a mile and it was dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="1625">It was really dangerous because we were afraid that we could meet some SS people who would recognize us. </sentence><sentence id="1626">So it happened that we were lucky. </sentence><sentence id="1627">We didn't meet many prisoners who had to salute us the prescribed way and where they had to take off their cap and, you know, look at us, and one of the fellows recognized me because I met him later on, 1945, in <span class="country">Italy</span>, and he said that I looked very pale. </sentence><sentence id="1628">Well, anyway so we came to the place where we were supposed to meet these prisoners whom we were taking out to work. </sentence><sentence id="1629">We told them to pick up their tools, the glass, and shouted the way the SS shouted at prisoners to pick up, and they picked up the glass and we walked towards the <span class="building">tower</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1630">And there our lookout gave us the sign that everything is clear, that we can go and we went. </sentence><sentence id="1631">We went it was a narrow <span class="dlf">pass</span> leading under the <span class="building">tower</span> and the guard on the <span class="building">tower</span> with the machine gun, seeing our insignia, you know, shouted Hail Hitler to us and we shouted This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence

day. </sentence><sentence id="1636">And we went, we passed. </sentence><sentence id="1637">We had to come to the main <span class="dlf">road</span> and on the main <span class="dlf">road</span> as we were maybe some 50 or 40 yards away, there were always roving patrols would check, you know, the SS and the prisoners who worked outside the big chain of guards and as we were approaching this <span class="dlf">road</span> on the <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> was an SS man, a Sergeant SS man on the <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> and he was looking in our direction, and he was unable to make up his mind whether to stop and check us out or whether to go on. </sentence><sentence id="1638">Anyway, he almost stopped on the <span class="spatial object">bike</span> and finally, he decided to go and he went on. </sentence><sentence id="1639">And we didn't know what we would do, but between ourselves we said if he does check out and he finds out we have the wrong passes, we either have to kill him or take him with us and hoping he wouldn't make to much noise. </sentence><sentence id="1640">Anyway, he did go on so we came to the <span class="dlf">road</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1641">As we came to the <span class="dlf">road</span>, going away from us was a whole company of SS going to the <span class="building">firing range</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1642">So they must have passed only a few minutes before we got there - so we crossed the <span class="dlf">road</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1643">We went into the <span class="building">houses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1644">There were new <span class="building">houses</span> being built for the SS and they had to be, you know, the panes had be put into the frames of the window frames. </sentence><sentence id="1645">It's not like here where the whole <span class="dlf">window</span> comes with glass and everything's there, you just put first the frame and then you have to put the <span class="dlf">window</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1646">So we went into the <span class="building">house</span> looked around. </sentence><sentence id="1647">Nobody was there. </sentence><sentence id="1648">We went to the other side of the <span class="building">house</span> and looked around. </sentence><sentence id="1649">Nobody there, and we walked because they were open <span class="dlf">fields</span> and the <span class="dlf">fields</span> led to the <span class="env feature">river</span>, the <span class="env feature">River Soya</span> [ph] which floats near and through <span class="populated place">Auschwitz city</span>, the <span class="populated place">city</span> of <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1650">We came to the <span class="env feature">river</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1651">Near the <span class="env feature">river</span> the vegetation was quite lush and in the brushes the glassers, you know, took off the heavy panes off their backs ad the other tools and we dumped it there. </sentence><sentence id="1652">And then we walked on the <span class="region">west side</span> of the <span class="env feature">river</span> going south for some 150 yards and then went into the <span class="env feature">river</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1653">The level of the <span class="env feature">river</span> was very low at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1654">We walked in the <span class="env feature">river bed</span> for some 150 yards in order to lose the scent for the dogs once the search would start, then cross to the <span class="region">east side</span> of the <span class="dlf">bank</span> and walked along. </sentence><sentence id="1655">As we walked further <span class="region">south</span> there was a couple lying, young couple lying in the <span class="env feature">grass</span> and we knew that there was only a fellow was supposed to be - anyway we came there and we don't hear any whistling of the carol, so we pass and suddenly we hear that somebody is walking or even running behind us and he's trying whistling but no tune comes out. </sentence><sentence id="1656">So we turned around and we then spoke in Polish what are you trying to whistle? </sentence><sentence id="1657">and he said this " "" and we said well, you're our contact then. </sentence><sentence id="1658">He said, yes. </sentence><sentence id="1659">He said, I couldn't get a tune out. </sentence><sentence id="1660">I was so nervous because you looked so impressive as SS men. </sentence><sentence id="1661">I said, now, you were supposed to be my yourself. </sentence><sentence id="1662">And he said, yes, but I was so lonely I said I better take a companion, the girl. </sentence><sentence id="1663">So then they came with us and we walked further <span class="region">south</span>, and they put us in very deep <span class="env feature">bushes</span> and we - he said we have to wait here. </sentence><sentence id="1664">I'm going to see the commandant of the unit, of the <span class="building">Partisan unit</span> and he will come here. </sentence><sentence id="1665">And he came after a while. </sentence><sentence id="1666">He came and he brought us three grenades and two real pistols this time. </sentence><sentence id="1667">And then he said we can't go any further until it become dark because some of the <span class="dlf">bridges</span> and the <span class="dlf">roads</span> are being watched by the SS. </sentence><sentence id="1668">So we waited in the <span class="env feature">bushes</span> until it became dark. </sentence><sentence id="1669">While we were sitting in the <span class="env feature">bushes</span> we heard the siren go off in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1670">We probably at that time were maybe three, three miles, three and a half miles away from the <span class="populated

and he led us through some <span class="dlf">pass</span> and <span class="dlf">roads</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1672">I don't know where. </sentence><sentence id="1673">Anyway, we came to a

very poor but Polish peasants didn't have much themselves. </sentence><sentence id="1676">Anyway, we did shed our SS uniforms which they hid because for further use later on, and the <span

id="1678">And then the same guide who picked us up came and walked us bypassing the <span class="populated place">villages</span> further south to the foothills of the <span class="env
