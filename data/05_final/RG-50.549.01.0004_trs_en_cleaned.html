<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="220">Q: Did you stay together at first? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="222">A: In the beginning we were together and it was also with many other Czech families. </sentence><sentence id="223">I just remember it was just very sad. </sentence><sentence id="224">I used to see people get hit. </sentence><sentence id="225">I know we were hungry almost all the time, and it was cold. </sentence><sentence id="226">There were soldiers and I really didn't understand what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="227">We had to stand in <span class="dlf">line</span> waiting for things and every once in a while my mom took us. </sentence><sentence id="228">We went to the <span class="building">hospital</span> for the doctor to look at us and I remember the very first time, especially because Rene -- I always felt he was a crybaby and I was afraid that he was going to cry, and I knew that if he cried something terrible might happen to him. </sentence><sentence id="229">I went first and to be examined and I was -- I didn't utter a sound. </sentence><sentence id="230">The whole time I kept hoping that Rene was going to be good too, because I didn't want anything to happen to him. </sentence><sentence id="231">So, we went with our mother. </sentence><sentence id="232">I also -- before we came to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> I remember there was one time where I remember we sat with our mother and we were being photographed, and I remember that particular moment. </sentence><sentence id="233">As it turns out we subsequently learned those were actually propaganda photographs that were sent out, and Ihave the picture today of Rene, my mother and I in <span class="populated place">Theresienstadt</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="246">Q: What was it about that moment that makes you remember? </sentence><sentence id="247">Is there anything particular about it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="250">A: Well, we were kind of like on <span class="spatial object">stage</span>. </sentence><sentence id="251">I think they kept saying smile, but we really didn't feel much like it, but what I remember was being like close to my mother, feeling her coat and just the closeness of her. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="254">Q: But you could not stay together for very long? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="256">A: No, at some point -- I know now it was six months afterwards we were separated from our mother. </sentence><sentence id="257">I remember it as being physically really taken from her, and I definitely remember a scream from her and I remember her getting hit by a soldier or some person and I just remember really -- it was very, very sad. </sentence><sentence id="258">I just somehow knew I'd never see her again. </sentence><sentence id="259">Well, in fact that is what happened because the entire lager was killed that night, and also not only was I separated from my mom, but then Rene and I were also separated because we were -- though we were twins, we were of the opposite sex, so they didn't keep twins of the opposite sex together. </sentence><sentence id="260">So, Rene was put in with twin boys, and I went in with the twin girls. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="266">Q: Did you know where he was? </sentence><sentence id="267">Were you aware of him being there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="270">A: I think throughout the whole time that I was in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, I always felt in my heart that Rene was okay. </sentence><sentence id="271">I had a vague idea where he was. </sentence><sentence id="272">It was from my <span class="spatial object">bunk</span> it was a little over to the right near some <span class="dlf">chimneys</span> or something, and in fact he really was there. </sentence><sentence id="273">That's how I remember it. </sentence><sentence id="274">There was once some kind of a fire and I was terribly scared that Rene's <span class="spatial object">bunk</span> may be caught up in that, but luckily he wasn't. </sentence><sentence id="275">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="276">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="277"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.01*0004 5 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="287">Q: Did you see him sometimes? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="289">A: Well, I don't recall that I saw him, although Rene says that he did once catch a glimpse of me, so, it's possible that I saw him too, but it didn't quite register for me. </sentence><sentence id="290">But somehow I always knew at some point no matter what this was, and I didn't understand what any of this was, that we'd somehow be together again. </sentence><sentence id="291">You asked earlier about memories of <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> and I guess most of them are really quite bad and I don't like speaking of them very much and I haven't spoken about some at all and I might never because I can't. </sentence><sentence id="292">But <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, the things that I remember very clearly is having to stand for hours for roll call, and I remember that I was one of the youngest and I was little and I always tried to hide behind somebody else, somebody taller so that I would not be seen. </sentence><sentence id="293">I think this was my mode of operation, is to be invisible and you can't get into trouble. </sentence><sentence id="294">I used to get a piece of bread, usually int he morning, with some black stuff to drink and I remember that I would always, since I was always -- maybe it was in the afternoon -- because I was always hungriest in the morning so I thought it would be really clever for me to try to save this piece of bread so I would have it the next day and of course it usually was gone and I didn't understand it but now in retrospect I think the rats and mice at <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> must have loved me. </sentence><sentence id="295">They knew who to come to. </sentence><sentence id="296">I remember standing in <span class="dlf">line</span>, humiliated standing outside in the cold naked waiting to get into the <span class="interior space">showers</span> and also terribly scared because somehow I knew that you didn't always come out of the <span class="interior space">shower</span>. </sentence><sentence id="297">I didn't know quite what happened, but I knew you didn't always come back. </sentence><sentence id="298">I'm amazed at my, I guess call it chutzpa, because I had a locket on my neck, a gold locket from my mom and I was determined to hang on to this and of course if they had seen it, I don't know what would happened to me, but I took it off my neck and held on to in my hand and somehow got passed the guard. </sentence><sentence id="299">I think what happened is in the <span class="spatial object">showers</span> it finally dropped out of my hand. </sentence><sentence id="300">But there was a little bit of me that said I got away -- I saved my <span class="spatial object">locket</span>. </sentence><sentence id="301">I remember once that I actually hid among dead bodies and I don't know exactly what was going on but I thought if I really lay still and make believe I was dead I would somehow escape whatever was happening. </sentence><sentence id="302">There was always this cloud of smoke in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> and there was always this smell that after a while I heard comments you know they're burning people. </sentence><sentence id="303">It's flesh burning. </sentence><sentence id="304">I don't think I still understood exactly. </sentence><sentence id="305">I said, you know, it couldn't be. </sentence><sentence id="306">I think my most horrendous memories are those of <span class="building">Doctor Mengala</span> and the <span class="building">hospital</span> and I seemed to be a favorite candidate. </sentence><sentence id="307">I don't know why but I remember getting injections and I remember having some little surgeries here and there, and things with electrical wires. </sentence><sentence id="308">I spent a lot of time in the <span class="building">hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="309">I was pretty sick very often, but somehow I held on because I knew that Rene needed me. </sentence><sentence id="310">I had to get by. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="333">Q: How did you know it was Doctor Mengele? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="335">A: Oh, I don't really think I really knew. </sentence><sentence id="336">I think I know that today. </sentence><sentence id="337">It was just a doctor. </sentence><sentence id="338">It just seemed like he was in charge. </sentence><sentence id="339">I mean to me he was like in charge of everything, next to God. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="345">Q: You were alone there from your family, but did you relate to other women? </sentence><sentence id="346">Do you </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="380">A: Not really. </sentence><sentence id="381">I also know that twin girls also had camaraderie because they had their siblings. </sentence><sentence id="382">But I think my overwhelming sense was just loneliness. </sentence><sentence id="383">I felt that I was just alone, always all alone and didn't belong anywhere. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="394">A: Well, I think I day-dreamed a little about -- I don't know exactly about what. </sentence><sentence id="395">I think I used to remember that I had a doll and I had <span class="spatial object">trains</span> and the toys I used to have, little building blocks. </sentence><sentence id="396">I remembered my mom and I used to remember the walks in the <span class="dlf">park</span> with my parents. </sentence><sentence id="397">I think that's how I got through. </sentence></p></dialogue>

id="870">We'll be happy to take them. </sentence><sentence id="871">And they did come to see me and they had seen me and they knew that I was introverted and shy. </sentence><sentence id="872">I never said hello to them. </sentence><sentence id="873">I never looked at them. </sentence><sentence id="874">It didn't matter. </sentence><sentence id="875">They were up to the challenge. </sentence><sentence id="876">So, very shortly after that, Eva Best took me over to Mr. and Mrs. Myer Slatkin who eventually adopted me and Rene, but that's a whole story, but I was not happy in the beginning because again, I felt like I had been given away again. </sentence><sentence id="877">This was the Polish woman. </sentence><sentence id="878">It was the <span

</sentence><sentence id="879">It seemed like nobody really wanted me and I only wanted to keep going back to Eva Best and I know that my mom though, she tried real hard. </sentence><sentence id="880">She bought me things. </sentence><sentence id="881">She tried to get me involved in going shopping and things, but I only wanted to go back to <span class="building">Eva Best</span>. </sentence><sentence id="882">It took quite a long time before I got really used to being with them. </sentence><sentence id="883">I continued in the same <span class="building">school</span>, and they were exceptionally loving to me. </sentence><sentence id="884">I started in the third grade in I think December and I think by March and April I was in fifth grade with children my age.

have done well. </sentence><sentence id="887">In fact, I excelled at Hebrew and they had a lot of patience. </sentence><sentence id="888">Slowly, slowly, I realized that this was going to be my <span

thousands of dollars to find Rene and to be finally able to get him here. </sentence><sentence id="889">But the one thing all through this is nobody ever asked me "What happened to you?" </sentence><sentence id="890">Nobody ever asked. </sentence><sentence id="891">Nobody ever wanted to know. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="963">A: I think because I felt really that I must have been bad to have so many horrible things happen to me that I wanted to prove to my new parents that I was worth adopting and that they could be proud of me, that I could be good. </sentence><sentence id="964">I think that was my need. </sentence><sentence id="965">Of course, I have to say that perhaps it wasn't so hard to excel at <span class="building">school</span> because I came from a very European kind of view of education where everything was very strict. </sentence><sentence id="966">You never spoke back to the teacher. </sentence><sentence id="967">You wouldn't dare show up without your assignment completed. </sentence><sentence id="968">Here I noticed that children just yelled things out in <span class="building">class</span> and even spoke among themselves while the teacher was giving the lesson. </sentence><sentence id="969">I thought they were going to get killed but I saw the teacher just said "be quiet," and nothing terrible was happening. </sentence><sentence id="970">A lot of times they came to <span class="building">school</span> and they didn't have the homework and I just could not relate to this. </sentence><sentence id="971">I thought something just terrible, terrible would happen if I came without my homework or if I spoke out of turn. </sentence><sentence id="972">So, I really, really could not understand the American system. </sentence><sentence id="973">It was very hard for me. </sentence><sentence id="974">I felt very outside all the time. </sentence><sentence id="975">I never kind of quite got into the fun of the activities at <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="976">I always had a certain sadness and memories that just kept haunting me. </sentence><sentence id="977">It didn't help that nobody ever asked me anything or wanted to even know. </sentence><sentence id="978">Even at <span class="building">school</span> and though I'm quite sure that all the teachers were perfectly aware that I was their one and only Holocaust student, a survivor student. </sentence><sentence id="979">No teacher ever befriended me especially or tried to help me especially. </sentence><sentence id="980">They just kind of let me be. </sentence><sentence id="981">But then again, now I'm thinking about it, I was very, very shy and very introverted and maybe they thought it was better to just let me be. </sentence><sentence id="982">My mother helped me a great deal with the English. </sentence><sentence id="983">She worked with me constantly because she was a teacher and she had a great deal of patience. </sentence><sentence id="984">Hebrew I was on my own. </sentence><sentence id="985">As great as I had all the material things I could wish for, and I seemingly fit in very well with the crowd. </sentence><sentence id="986">I was in the right crowd. </sentence><sentence id="987">I was among the most popular. </sentence><sentence id="988">I was in the right clique, but it was never right for me because nobody -- I had a lot of problems inside that I didn't know how to deal with and it seemed nobody else knew either at that time. </sentence><sentence id="989">Also, I got the feeling that if I ever spoke about prewar things, somehow my parents didn't like that. </sentence><sentence id="990">They wanted me to forget and just accept this as a new life, as a new start and just go on from there and forget everything from the past. </sentence><sentence id="991">I had a lot of trouble with this because I very often had dreams and flashbacks and I had nobody to tell. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1081">A: Well, I was so totally ashamed of my tattoo because I felt that this was a mark of some sort that I had committed some great grievance sin for which I had been adequately punished, but I certainly didn't want anybody to know that I was in a concentration <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1082">I mean that was like, my God, I would sooner die than have someone know. </sentence><sentence id="1083">So, my mom was very understanding about this. </sentence><sentence id="1084">In the winter I only wore long sleeved things and then in the summer she bought all these pancake powders and started mixing them to match my skin. </sentence><sentence id="1085">Every morning she'd get this waterproof stuff and she'd mix the color to be exactly right and we'd feather it and powder it and I thought it was really quite good, but in all honesty, anybody who had any eyes would have seen that there was something on my arm that I was covering, but no one ever asked. </sentence><sentence id="1086">In fact, it's strange, I remember over hearing a teacher in my <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1087">Somebody who came to teach after I was already there and somebody must have been saying "See her, she's the little girl that came from the <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>" and this person in total ignorance and I heard this said "It couldn't be. </sentence><sentence id="1088">No children survived the <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>." </sentence><sentence id="1089">So, blotto me out totally. </sentence><sentence id="1090">I had no -- they had no psychologists. </sentence><sentence id="1091">My parents never thought of it. </sentence><sentence id="1092">I was in desperate need. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1963">A: That's really a hard question. </sentence><sentence id="1964">I can only really say that no matter how hard I try, everything in my life always leads back to the Holocaust and <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1965">It's just always, always there beneath everything. </sentence><sentence id="1966">Perhaps, it has made me in a strange kind of way I think I'm strong because of it. </sentence><sentence id="1967">People always tell me, "Oh, you're so strong." </sentence><sentence id="1968">I don't know if I'm strong but I feel I have an endurance that's beyond the average. </sentence><sentence id="1969">I can tolerate more things. </sentence><sentence id="1970">I have more patience. </sentence><sentence id="1971">I appreciate things more because I always know how elusive they can be and how very quickly things could change. </sentence><sentence id="1972">That's it. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1995">A: I think it's a two sided thing. </sentence><sentence id="1996">It's important to do it. </sentence><sentence id="1997">A lot of people will not read the books and not attend the lectures and a lot of people need to have things -- movies that are popular. </sentence><sentence id="1998">I think it's always watered down, and somehow it takes away from it. </sentence><sentence id="1999">I'm not even expressing it properly but it was so horrible and so awesome and so out of this world that you can dilute it and make it into a popular film, it just loses. </sentence></p></dialogue>
