I've learned, very sympathetic to Hitler and was very much involved locally or never... I don't know whether he just took over the <span class="building">business</span>, didn't buy it. </sentence><sentence id="25">But I know there was all the family felt pretty badly about that. </sentence><sentence id="26">And some members of my family never want to go back to <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="27">Her two sisters have never gone back. </sentence><sentence id="28">We did a little bit of exploring. </sentence><sentence id="29">My mother, there's a small <span class="dlf">Jewish cemetery</span>, my mother had a sister who died, a fourth sister, who died early, either when her mother gave birth to her... her mother had been married, her father had married twice. </sentence><sentence id="30">But there is the <span class="interior space">grave</span> of the young child, who either died, was like a month old. </sentence><sentence id="31">And so that <span class="dlf">cemetery</span> was still kept in quite good condition. </sentence><sentence id="32">I don't think there was a <span class="building">synagogue</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="33">It's coming back a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="34">But we really did not meet any members of the Jewish community and I doubt if there are any Jews in <span class="populated place">Oberstein</span>. </sentence><sentence id="35">Because when we did go, we then went to <span class="populated place">Magdeburg</span>, my <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="36">We had not been to <span class="populated place">Magdeburg</span> at all, because it was in the <span class="region">East zone</span>. </sentence><sentence id="37"><span class="populated place">Hamburg</span> was in the <span class="region">West zone</span> and <span class="populated place">Magdeburg</span> is the next large <span class="populated place">city</span> down the <span class="env feature">Elbe River</span> from <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="38">So when we went back to <span class="populated place">Magdeburg</span>, they were having, it had been badly bombed in several major raids. </sentence><sentence id="39">It was a <span class="populated place">town</span> of about three hundred thousand people, an <span class="building">industrial center</span>. </sentence><sentence id="40">We lived in the <span class="building">synagogue</span>, we'll get to this a little bit later, but we had... and the Russians had renamed all the <span class="dlf">streets</span>, so they were just starting to rename them back. </sentence><sentence id="41">And so we had a little trouble finding, trying to orient the <span class="spatial object">map</span> to show Mother where we used to live and the <span class="building">synagogue</span> we used to live in, where it was. </sentence><sentence id="42">Now there's just a <span class="spatial object">memorial tablet</span> in the location. </sentence><sentence id="43">There was a big <span class="building">office building</span>. </sentence><sentence id="44">But that is gone. </sentence><sentence id="45">But then we, it happened that during the week we were there, they had a memorial exhibit to the Jewish community from <span class="populated place">Magdeburg</span> in one of the... there's a <span class="interior space">cloister</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="46">There's a very large <span class="building">cathedral</span> in <span class="populated place">Magdeburg</span>, which is fairly famous. </sentence><sentence id="47">And there was actually, the week we were there, they were having a, one of these annual conferences of the 3 This is a

http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 4 Protestant gathering in <span class="country">Germany</span> that moves around. </sentence><sentence id="50">All the <span class="building">churches</span> were there and they had <span class="spatial object">booths</span> set up and they had services in the main <span class="dlf">square</span>. </sentence><sentence id="51">And one of the groups there was a group that was trying to promote better relationships between <span class="country">Germany</span> and <span class="country">Israel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="52">And they, they were not Jewish, but that was the mission of this group. </sentence><sentence id="53">And they pointed us in the direction of some people who knew some of the Jewish folks. </sentence><sentence id="54">Again, we went to see this <span class="spatial object">exhibit</span> and I can get into that with you a little bit, because one of the <span class="spatial object">exhibits</span> involved, it was a diary written by the person who was the Rabbi in the congregation with my father, who had written a diary when they were picked up to go to the <span class="building">Holocaust museum</span>. </sentence><sentence id="55">I mean to go to the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="56">So, this is a long winded way of telling you that there, we know there was a <span class="building">Jewish congregation</span>. </sentence><sentence id="57">When we were walking around the <span class="building">city buildings</span>, and we had this...bumped into this woman who was Jewish or who knew the Jewish... had some connection. </sentence><sentence id="58">And she worked in the <span class="building">city hall</span>, worked with the mayor, just happened. </sentence><sentence id="59">And so, it happened when we were walking by that the mayor came out and we spoke to him a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="60">And he said they were just trying, starting, he was interested and glad to meet mother and said the <span class="populated place">city</span> was starting to put together an event like a lot of other <span class="populated place">cities</span> had done, to bring the Jewish members of the congregation or for the Jews from <span class="populated place">Magdeburg</span>, back to <span class="populated place">Magdeburg</span> for a kind of gathering and reconciliation sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="61">But I don't think that's happened or she continues to get mailings now from the congregation which is... there was not an active <span class="building">synagogue</span> that we knew of or could find. </sentence><sentence id="62">I think they said there were several hundred families, but we really didn't go out of our way. </sentence><sentence id="63">I've got a book, little brochure at <span class="building">home</span> or here, from that <span class="spatial object">exhibit</span>, which was very touching and very nice. </sentence><sentence id="64">Had a huge wall-sized photograph of the inside of the <span class="building">synagogue</span> where my father was the, where my dad was involved. </sentence><sentence id="65">Anyway there were very few Jews, I think. </sentence><sentence id="66">And it was not an organized congregation yet, but we either didn't bump into them correctly. </sentence><sentence id="67">I mean, we were, it was more of a sight-seeing trip than an effort to dig into records about the congregation sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="68">Because we also had a limited amount of time. </sentence><sentence id="69">And so we got in the <span class="spatial object">car</span>. </sentence><sentence id="70">I had a <span class="spatial object">car</span> and we did drive over to the <span class="region">section</span> where Mother, my dad and my mom first lived, when we came there. </sentence><sentence id="71">I mean, when they first, when my father first married Mother in <span class="populated place">Idar-Oberstein</span> and then they moved to <span class="populated place">Magdeburg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="72">It was a small <span class="interior space">garden apartment</span> kind of place, a little young couple's new... I'm sure at the time looked very pretty. </sentence><sentence id="73">That <span class="region">area</span> had not been bombed and was still there. </sentence><sentence id="74">It was just much more rundown. </sentence><sentence id="75">I mean it was like going to a <span class="building">building</span> that was 50 years old. </sentence><sentence id="76">But the <span class="spatial object">flower boxes</span> were there and we did manage to... you know, we drove by where they probably lived or near where they, in that <span class="populated place">community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="77">Remarkable for me to see, because my dad didn't have a <span class="spatial object">car</span> and he <span class="spatial object">bicycled</span> to work every day. </sentence><sentence id="78">People either walked or took <span class="spatial object">bikes</span> right into, in the twenties and thirties. </sentence><sentence id="79">I guess he moved to, well I was born in "31, so he and Mother had been married two years. </sentence><sentence id="80">So it was this very pretty little... it was kind of like being in <span class="populated place">suburbia</span> and taking a <span class="spatial object">bike</span>, biking into <span class="building">work</span> every day. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="162">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="163">Had your father been, you said he met your mother in <span class="populated place">Idar-Oberstein</span>? </sentence><sentence id="164">Had he been from there or from <span class="populated place">Magdeburg</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="168">A: My dad was a, he was born in <span class="populated place">Leer</span>, <span class="populated place">Ost-Friesland</span>, which is in the <span class="region">northwestern part</span> of <span class="country">Germany</span>, near the <span class="region">Frisian Islands</span>. </sentence><sentence id="169">And I have a family... I was just looking and we have a pretty good family tree on his mother's side of the family, going back to the 1700s. </sentence><sentence id="170">His father was a junk dealer and he had nine brothers and sisters. </sentence><sentence id="171">He had a large family. </sentence><sentence id="172">And then his father, unfortunately, when he was very young, committed suicide. </sentence><sentence id="173">4 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="174">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="175"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 5 </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="186">A: My father's father. </sentence><sentence id="187">Leaving my mother! </sentence><sentence id="188">with this huge, rather large family when they were... I think at that point he was probably like fifteen or sixteen. </sentence><sentence id="189">And so, he went, spent some years in an <span class="building">orphanage</span> in <span class="populated place">Hanover</span> and then went on to our equivalent of <span class="building">college</span>, and to be a <span class="building">Jewish school</span> teacher, which when you think back about it, was quite an achievement. </sentence><sentence id="190">He had an older brother, Sammy, and several sisters. </sentence><sentence id="191">He also had a younger brother, who also committed suicide. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="198">Q: Your father's younger brother? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="200">A: Yeah, named Meir, who had an affair, I think with a non-Jewish girl, and decided... which was a no-no in a big way back then. </sentence><sentence id="201">But he had several sisters, Jetta and Martha, both of whom married of all things, butchers in the next <span class="populated place">communities</span>. </sentence><sentence id="202">And they came to this <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="203">One of them is named <span class="building">Dan de Vries</span>. </sentence><sentence id="204">His wife's name is Martha. </sentence><sentence id="205">They've both died in the last ten years and their son lives in <span class="region">New Jersey</span>. </sentence><sentence id="206">And his wife is actually the woman who published the coffee book for the <span class="building">Holocaust museum</span>. </sentence><sentence id="207">His name is Alan de Vries. </sentence><sentence id="208">He'd been married before, but Judy and he've been married for many years. </sentence><sentence id="209">And then he had this other sister, Jetta Van der Wyck, married Nathan Van der Wyck. </sentence><sentence id="210">They came to this <span class="country">country</span> and had three daughters and she is still living. </sentence><sentence id="211">She's ninety... She's kind of failing, but she's now 90, I guess. </sentence><sentence id="212">Then he had a sister Ola", who was married and went to <span class="country">Argentina</span> and then divorced her husband and came back to <span class="populated place">New York</span> and lived there until she was about fifty and died. </sentence><sentence id="213">And another sister, Lina", who with her husband went to <span class="country">Israel</span>, early, one of the early settlers in <span class="country">Israel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="214">They moved to a <span class="populated place">moshay</span>" in <span class="country">Israel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="215">And they have a son, Moshe, who is my age and whom we have visited. </sentence><sentence id="216">I think that's all the sisters and brothers. </sentence><sentence id="217">Two of those families came to this <span class="country">country</span> and lived in <span class="populated place">New York</span>, in the <span class="region">New York area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="218">And both of them were... well, Nathan was a butcher and he died relatively young in this <span class="country">country</span>, while the girls were still growing up. </sentence><sentence id="219">The... Dan de Vries lived, well he actually outlived Alan's mother, but he lived to be about in his eighties. </sentence><sentence id="220">And I think Martha was right around eighty when she died. </sentence><sentence id="221">But my father, you know this large family, his mother's name was Wexler before she was married to a Rosenberg. </sentence><sentence id="222">And her father and her father's father were fairly prominent rabbis in this <span class="region">northern part</span> of <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="223">The Wexler family, that was there. </sentence><sentence id="224">So, there was a very heavy religious influence in my father's family. </sentence><sentence id="225">And my dad was very knowledgeable in Jewish law. </sentence><sentence id="226">He knew the five books of Moses by heart. </sentence><sentence id="227">You could start him in the <span class="spatial object">Torah</span>. </sentence><sentence id="228">If you go into the <span class="building">synagogue</span>, the five books of Moses are in the scroll and you could start my father anywhere and he could give you the rest of the <span class="dlf">passage</span>. </sentence><sentence id="229">So, he was a <span class="building">Jewish school</span> teacher. </sentence><sentence id="230">When he got his degree, he went to <span class="populated place">Idar-Oberstein</span> I think originally, probably as a practice teaching. </sentence><sentence id="231">But he came there as a young bachelor. </sentence><sentence id="232">And he met, to be a <span class="building">school</span> teacher. </sentence><sentence id="233">And... or whether a Sunday school teacher in the <span class="building">Jewish school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="234">And he met my mother, who was a student. </sentence><sentence id="235">She was like sixteen when he met her. </sentence><sentence id="236">I think he had another, I think he had a year of <span class="building">school</span> to go. </sentence><sentence id="237">And he came and he went. </sentence><sentence id="238">He was, she said a very jealous man, when she was still going with some other, this Hans or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="239">And she was  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 6 18, I guess, quite young, when they were married. </sentence><sentence id="240">Then he took her back to <span class="populated place">Magdeburg</span>, where he got a position with the Jewish, with the <span class="building">synagogue</span> and the Jewish... it wasn't the <span class="building">welfare agency</span>, but it was like the United, not United Jewish Appeal... sort of like the Central Kentucky Jewish Organization. </sentence><sentence id="241">He was assisting the, assisted the rabbi as a, not as the cantor, but as the lay leader, with services and with classes. </sentence><sentence id="242">And then he also taught classes to people, to Jews who wanted to go to <span class="country">Israel</span>, in Hebrew, and preparing them to go. </sentence><sentence id="243">And I think he wanted to go to <span class="country">Israel</span>, but my mother did not. </sentence><sentence id="244">She wanted to come to this <span class="country">country</span>, if they were going to leave, because her family was here. </sentence><sentence id="245">And I think my dad really wanted to go to <span class="country">Israel</span>, but they were, like many others, not really, did not think this thing was going to get as bad as it did. </sentence><sentence id="246">So that's where he met her and then brought her to <span class="populated place">Magdeburg</span> in this little <span class="interior space">garden apartment</span>, this very pretty, young woman. </sentence><sentence id="247">And then a year later... Mother always likes to kid that I'm a... I don't know if you realize that people who are born in very early October are often New Year's Eve babies. </sentence><sentence id="248">They had a big party. </sentence><sentence id="249">Here I am. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="300">Q: Did you, you mentioned about your father's family being religious. </sentence><sentence id="301">Were you instilled at an early age with a sense of religion, or was there a religious... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="304">A: We were kosher at <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="305">We had, I suppose in <span class="country">Germany</span> a pretty, what would be called, it wasn't Reform, probably like the <span class="building">Conservative American congregation</span> or family. </sentence><sentence id="306">We had a <span class="building">kosher household</span>, that meant Mother had two sets of dishes. </sentence><sentence id="307">We had all, we had Sabbath. </sentence><sentence id="308">My father being with the <span class="building">synagogue</span>, went there regularly. </sentence><sentence id="309">And I would go with him. </sentence><sentence id="310">But I was only eight. </sentence><sentence id="311">I mean I was really young. </sentence><sentence id="312">I went to the...

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="328">A: Yeah, well when I went to <span class="building">school</span> first in nineteen, let's see I would have been six years old, that's 1937 when I started. </sentence><sentence id="329">I don't know if my father had been... I think he'd actually, he must have been a teacher in that <span class="building">school</span> along with being at the <span class="building">synagogue</span>. </sentence><sentence id="330">I think he must have, that must have been his other occupation, that he was actually teaching <span class="building">school</span> already, besides working in the <span class="building">synagogue</span>. </sentence><sentence id="331">Because when I went to the first grade, it was in the <span class="building">school</span> where he was teaching. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="336">Q: And what did he do in the <span class="building">synagogue</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1928">Q: I was going to ask you about that. </sentence><sentence id="1929">It seems that, well I've heard other people talk about arriving in <span class="populated place">New York</span> and there being a lot of encouragement for Jews who were immigrating to go to various other parts of the <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1930">And so many people just didn't want to do that and felt so strongly about that, that they stayed in <span class="populated place">New York</span> even though there was no economic opportunity at all. </sentence><sentence id="1931">And I guess this is more of an observation than a question, but your dad seems to have been somebody who was very open-minded and aware of opportunities, and that probably shaped your life a lot, too. </sentence><sentence id="1932">I mean, being a child in a situation where you experienced this extreme disadvantage through having your childhood interrupted so much, and then having your family really be broken apart, and many of them killed. </sentence><sentence id="1933">But for you to be able to arrive in this new place and be kind of honored for who you are and what your history is... it's kind of different than what Jewish kids in <span class="populated place">New York</span>, who were immigrating were experiencing for the most part, it seems to me. </sentence><sentence id="1934">There were so many immigrants, and so many survivors and people who weren't really overall encouraged to talk about what had happened to them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1942">A: Well yeah, I mean, I suppose that going... I don't know why my Dad did not explore a little more about the teaching. </sentence><sentence id="1943">I don't know that, whether, how he felt <span class="populated place">New York</span>... we were living in a very crowded place and I think he wanted to get us out of there. </sentence><sentence id="1944">Because that <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, big as it was, had my mother's parents, and her two sisters. </sentence><sentence id="1945">And we sort of were just, they would just let us live there. </sentence><sentence id="1946">But I don't think he wanted to stay there. </sentence><sentence id="1947">So he set about pretty early trying to figure out what he could do and how to earn a living basically and bring money <span class="building">home</span>, enough. </sentence><sentence id="1948">And that <span class="populated place">New York City</span>, whether he felt too hemmed-in there, or there just really wasn't very much for him to do, because he couldn't be a teacher, he couldn't be a rabbi, and he couldn't get ajob. </sentence><sentence id="1949">There were so many people looking for work, as you say, and it was this immigrant situation. </sentence><sentence id="1950">But it did, I'm sure, shaped my life, from the time we went <span class="region">South</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1951">But I think, I don't know that he always... I mean, you know, they had a very strong work ethic. </sentence><sentence id="1952">My parents have a strong work ethic. </sentence><sentence id="1953">And so they encouraged me or were not opposed to seeing me have a <span class="dlf">paper route</span> at a very young age. </sentence><sentence id="1954">And then, I mean that's a very liberating experience. </sentence><sentence id="1955">I always tell people, I remember getting up at five in the morning, and going out to get the paper and then going by the <span class="building">coffee store</span> and putting that nickel down on the <span class="spatial object">lunch counter</span> and saying, "I'd like a cup of coffee." ( </sentence><sentence id="1956">Laughing.) </sentence><sentence id="1957">I mean I was probably not much higher than the <span class="spatial object">stool</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1958">But you know when you have a <span class="dlf">newspaper route</span> and you start putting a little money in your own pocket... So I always had a job of one sort or another. </sentence><sentence id="1959">I mean my parents just didn't have any extra money to... and we knew that, because we knew how they lived. </sentence><sentence id="1960">Whether there might have been small, I guess there might have been a small allowance at one point, but after that <span class="dlf">newspaper route</span>, I delivered papers at <span class="building">home</span> for a while and then I started... I was telling Reval?here the other day, my fiscal director, I hadn't thought about it, somebody <span class="interior space">downstairs</span> was, some of these people sell <span class="building">Home Interiors</span>, and they do lot of, sell things. </sentence><sentence id="1961">I was always selling things, when I was thirteen, I started selling stationery and greeting cards around the, knocking on <span class="dlf">doors</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1962">Had a little... within a year I had a little business. </sentence><sentence id="1963">Had a whole <span class="interior space">room</span> full of stationery and greeting cards for all occasions. </sentence><sentence id="1964">And then I was going to the <span class="building">factory</span> owners and selling Christmas cards to <span class="building">businesses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1965">Then I started working in <span class="populated place">town</span> after <span class="building">school</span> for the Jewish merchants. </sentence><sentence id="1966">I was always working, doing some kind of work. </sentence><sentence id="1967">And it didn't really get in the way. </sentence><sentence id="1968"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 27 I mean, but kids...people... all of those experiences help you appreciate the way other people live, especially working people. </sentence><sentence id="1969">Women you worked with back then, and their families, and money's tight and how you make it and don't make it, and so you have an appreciation for that. </sentence><sentence id="1970">And my mom and dad, my mother was basically always worked at <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1971">She never worked. </sentence><sentence id="1972">I mean, she was a very traditional mother, in that she was a housekeeper and cooked, did the cooking. </sentence><sentence id="1973">And later on, I think, when my brother and my sister is ten years... my sister was born in 1946!". </sentence><sentence id="1974">So she's fifteen years younger than I am, eleven years younger than my brother and was not initially expected, I think. </sentence><sentence id="1975">But Mom, after my sister was born, a few years later, she finally became, decided she wanted to work, and became a sales lady in one of the large <span class="building">department stores</span>, where she worked for a long time. </sentence><sentence id="1976">And I think it did a lot for her, she had never worked in any <span class="building">store</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1977">But she's a very warm, very outgoing woman and was everybody's buddy. </sentence><sentence id="1978">And so, she was a very good salesperson, but it was a new experience for her. </sentence><sentence id="1979">I think it was an enormous adjustment for her. </sentence><sentence id="1980">And really for Dad. </sentence><sentence id="1981">And so when I, I think... anyway, scouting, during the... we were a little, I suppose people, where else in the <span class="region">South</span>, when you think about it, with this history, being, having people recognize you, elect you to be president of the class or something was quite a nice thing. </sentence><sentence id="1982">But I think scouting, and scouting did a lot of that. </sentence><sentence id="1983">I became an Eagle Scout, and was a counselor in a <span class="populated place">scout camp</span> for several, in the summers for several years, very close to the scout executive. </sentence><sentence id="1984">In fact, he... this is really kind of off the subject, but it's interesting when we say how things affect your lives. </sentence><sentence id="1985">The scout executive in <span class="populated place">Gastonia</span>, married a woman, who was a Cherokee Indian. </sentence><sentence id="1986">He was a, his name was Schiele. </sentence><sentence id="1987">He was a park ranger for much of his life, and then he got into scouting. </sentence><sentence id="1988">And he also, during his ranger days, learned to stuff, to make, he was a taxidermist. </sentence><sentence id="1989">He amassed a large collection of animals that he had mounted. </sentence><sentence id="1990">And his wife collected, and together they also collected a lot of Native American things, since she was a Cherokee Indian. </sentence><sentence id="1991">And when we were, in the summer in our <span class="populated place">camp</span> we put on a large Indian pageant every Thursday night. </sentence><sentence id="1992">The pageant of Hiawatha. </sentence><sentence id="1993">I was Hiawatha for several years and my brother was Minihaha. </sentence><sentence id="1994">They'd put a wig on him and I would paddle a <span class="spatial object">canoe</span> in the lights at night and bring him up. </sentence><sentence id="1995">But Bud Schiele, when he retired, he gave this collection to the <span class="populated place">town</span> of <span class="populated place">Gastonia</span> and said, I'd like to start a little <span class="building">museum</span> here. </sentence><sentence id="1996">So, he gave that collection and began a <span class="building">natural history museum</span>, which today is about a <span class="dlf">square block</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1997">He's no longer there, but they've developed this wonderful <span class="building">museum</span> of natural history with <span class="dlf">outdoor walking trails</span> and some really beautiful... it's quite remarkable in the sense that it's also twenty miles from <span class="populated place">Charlotte</span>, which has a very large science <span class="building">museum</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1998">But the point I'm getting to, is that after, when I was at, later went to <span class="building">Duke University</span>, I was a chemistry major before I was a lawyer. </sentence><sentence id="1999">We can talk more about that if you want to. </sentence><sentence id="2000">I've always had an interest in science and in this <span class="region">region</span> here, we are behind, I mean educationally we're still behind. </sentence><sentence id="2001">We've caught up. </sentence><sentence id="2002">But I've always had an interest, as much as a result of that experience and seeing Bud Schiele's <span class="building">museum</span> grow, in starting a <span class="building">science museum</span> here. </sentence><sentence id="2003">And so outside of my work, my major activity has been involved with this organization that we began, and in the last <span class="building">legislature</span>, we finally got two and a half million dollars and we're going to put a <span class="building">planetarium</span> with a very sophisticated projection system out here at the <span class="building">community college</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2004">And the guy, and in fact in our little <span class="building">offices</span> are next <span class="dlf">door</span>, and we have a picture of the <span class="building">Schiele Museum</span> on the <span class="dlf">wall</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2005">Because seeing that effort work and flourish in the small <span class="populated place">town</span> of <span class="populated place">Gastonia</span> gave me some real thought, idea about the fact that we can do it here. </sentence><sentence id="2006">I think a lot of, I mean I think scouting gave me a lot in terms of values apart from the Judaism that is in my family. </sentence><sentence id="2007">

I mean, <span class="populated place">Charlotte</span> has a large <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span> and there were a lot of children our age, boys and girls, men and women. </sentence><sentence id="2104">Then when you get to <span class="building">college</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2105">But we had the Bar Mitzvah. </sentence><sentence id="2106">And you know, my father, people were very aware of the Jewish community, I think, in <span class="populated place">Gastonia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2107">I was always, in retrospect, after I worked in the <span class="building">Civil Rights Division</span> and after I was in the service, I always felt a little sad that the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span> was not a little more assertive about desegregation. </sentence><sentence id="2108">But I think the <span class="building">store</span> owners were all afraid to lose their business. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2160">A: Yeah, we were talking about the Jewish communities in these <span class="populated place">towns</span> and what they might have done. </sentence><sentence id="2161">| think it's always hard to look back and say, but I think the answer would have been if they had felt they could have done more, they might have done more. </sentence><sentence id="2162">I think that they were in the <span class="building">business establishment</span> just the way...

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2257">A: No, it was very interesting, I think. </sentence><sentence id="2258">Because the Scout troop, all the Scout troops were sponsored by <span class="building">churches</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2259">And the <span class="building">Scout troop</span> I was a member of was sponsored by the Associate Reform, ARP. </sentence><sentence id="2260">They were called the Associate Reform Presbyterians. </sentence><sentence id="2261">And I think they'd had two or three other Eagle Scouts from the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2262">And so, the answer is no. </sentence><sentence id="2263">I mean I think they were cognizant of the fact that we were Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="2264">And I don't know that anybody ever tried to sort of convert anyone. </sentence><sentence id="2265">But the troop, when I got to <span class="populated place">scout camp</span> as a counselor one summer, I was sort of... I wasn't... One of my jobs was to arrange the services and many of the scout troops had ministers along with them or they were their scout masters. </sentence><sentence id="2266">And so, I found myself in the position of being, sort of the associate minister to these folks and I learned all the, many of the hymns. </sentence><sentence id="2267">And as we grew up, I went to <span class="building">church</span> a few times. </sentence><sentence id="2268">I certainly went to that <span class="building">Presbyterian church</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2269">But I think it was just a healthy respect. </sentence><sentence id="2270">I think people in the <span class="building">church</span> appreciated, I mean were respectful of the Jewish community and that religion. </sentence><sentence id="2271">And often times people came to those services. </sentence><sentence id="2272">So, I don't know that, I think, you know, we often, the Schieles encouraged me to do that actually, the scout master. </sentence><sentence id="2273">To be... and I often times did the Vesper services for the campers who were there over the weekend. </sentence><sentence id="2274">And there would probably be not much Jesus, but I would read from the Old and the New Testament and we would sing the hymns that they knew, and it didn't bother me. </sentence><sentence id="2275">Now it might very well have bothered many other, not... other Jewish men might have said, "Well you're just stupid. </sentence><sentence id="2276">What are you doing this for?" </sentence><sentence id="2277">Or you know, "Why are you being a minister in this largely <span class="populated place">Protestant camp</span> and sort of embracing their way of having a service?" </sentence><sentence id="2278">But I didn't have any problem with that. </sentence><sentence id="2279">My parents didn't have any problem with it. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3235">A: I think I always had a very strong feeling about allegiance to <span class="country">America</span> or patriotism. </sentence><sentence id="3236">I mean that goes back to my parents coming here. </sentence><sentence id="3237">You know, I think as you get older, when events like <span class="country">Vietnam</span> happens, you question it the way any other... the value of that action or any other action that the <span class="country">country</span> takes as a nation, intervening in other wars or as a world leader and the limits to which you would want to go, that people go to in the name of... that actions that we take as Americans against other <span class="country">countries</span>, or whatever we do in our official nature. </sentence><sentence id="3238">As an American, I mean, as a responsible citizen should do, but I have certainly never gave it any thought. </sentence><sentence id="3239">I mean, I think as I said, when we were on alert for a week and didn't know whose side we were on, I thought that's not a way I want to spend my life. </sentence><sentence id="3240">I think if it were a little clearer than that I might have stayed in the <span class="building">military</span> just because of the very close associations I had with the people that I was in the Service with. </sentence><sentence id="3241">I mean we were just very, very good friends. </sentence><sentence id="3242">And when you do things together and rely on each other in situations I suppose that are somewhat dangerous, and you become very close. </sentence><sentence id="3243">It doesn't have to be just on the <span class="dlf">battlefield</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3244">Even when you are doing training exercises that are, that involve some danger, in which you act as a team. </sentence><sentence id="3245">And then you spend a lot of off time together or you're on a <span class="building">base</span>, like a small <span class="building">base</span> out in nowhere in <span class="country">England</span>, you become part of a family in some way. </sentence><sentence id="3246">And so there was, I would have considered that, I just was not... but I decided that I don't know that I'm ready to push the button on <span class="country">Israel</span> for example and start... if we had come in on the other side against <span class="country">Israel</span>, I would have been in a terrible predicament. </sentence><sentence id="3247">And wouldn't want to find myself in that predicament. </sentence><sentence id="3248">And then after I married a Quaker, I left my tennis shoes at the <span class="building">Pentagon Athletic Club</span> and never went back to get them. </sentence><sentence id="3249">You know, I probably have a much more, in some ways a different outlook about the value of violence and the value of military actions to some extent. </sentence><sentence id="3250">It's certainly been moderated. </sentence><sentence id="3251">I wouldn't at all call myself a pacifist. </sentence><sentence id="3252">But I don't know, anyway, that's, I certainly think I would certainly consider myself a very, very much an American citizen. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3277">A: Well, I think, you know, philosophically you obviously, Quakers, if you take that position, take a strong pacifist position, you are in a sense ready to die when someone points a weapon at someone you love and is ready to pull a trigger. </sentence><sentence id="3278">And you're not going to interfere with that sort of situation. </sentence><sentence id="3279">Or you feel that there is never any justification for violent action. </sentence><sentence id="3280">And I don't think I'm in that place. </sentence><sentence id="3281">I mean I think there probably are situations where you may find yourself willing to react violently or to take up arms against somebody else under certain situations, under those situations. </sentence><sentence id="3282">Like a war. </sentence><sentence id="3283">And you use a war to end a war.

" </sentence><sentence id="3901">Well, he told me to copy this and write it down." </sentence><sentence id="3902">That kind of thing. </sentence><sentence id="3903">And so we gradually were able to get the <span class="building">courts</span> to adopt a theory that if you, that they have to register blacks on the same basis they registered the least qualified white person. </sentence><sentence id="3904">I don't know that in those early cases, it wasn't to register illiterates, because the <span class="building">courts</span> didn't want to register people who were just illiterate. </sentence><sentence id="3905">But if you could write, if they were accepting someone who could only write their name or who could understand a very basic sentence, that that would be applied across the board. </sentence><sentence id="3906">But that took several years, because the <span class="building">courts</span> were unwilling. </sentence><sentence id="3907">They would find some excuses. </sentence><sentence id="3908">Or they would say "We'll register the five, we've got to register those five people who testified. </sentence><sentence id="3909">I believe that's true of them, but you don't have any others here. </sentence><sentence id="3910">Who else do you have?" </sentence><sentence id="3911">Well, we might not... there weren't any others because they were afraid to go, even though there might have been more blacks living in the <span class="populated place">county</span> than whites. </sentence><sentence id="3912">But all the whites were registered and very few blacks. </sentence><sentence id="3913">And that goes back to reconstruction and the development of the literacy test and the poll test, tax. </sentence><sentence id="3914">So, we spent our first, I spent the first few years in those kinds of cases. </sentence><sentence id="3915">And as we got more lawyers, and as we did those cases, the <span class="populated place">Greenwood</span>... that was also the period of time when there was more, there was more action by SNCC and CORE. </sentence><sentence id="3916">And you know, in 1964 you had the killing of the three civil rights workers around that very thing. </sentence><sentence id="3917">They were holding voting rights meetings in <span class="populated place">Neshoba County</span>, <span class="region">Mississippi</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>

I mean I think all of these things that were going on were part of the big picture. </sentence><sentence id="4317">I think the <span class="populated place">Division</span> had a very prominent role, a very pronounced role that isn't always recognized. </sentence><sentence id="4318">Not just because I was there, because I think we demonstrated that the <span class="building">court</span>, that using the court system was extremely slow and wasn't going to answer this... that we could win one little case at a time, but, and that was doing some good. </sentence><sentence id="4319">And we were starting to... that that was helping. </sentence><sentence id="4320">And it also gave blacks some confidence to win. </sentence><sentence id="4321">But for the broader picture to change, we also helped write the Voting Rights Act of 1965. </sentence><sentence id="4322">That Congress... you had to do more than that. </sentence><sentence id="4323">And I think the civil rights, I think in a lot of these struggles, things like whether it's the <span class="dlf">Wall</span> coming down or whatever it is, someone, it always seems to take an incident like the civil rights workers" death*?to wake people up, unfortunately. </sentence><sentence id="4324">I mean it's, there are mining disasters that cause the mine safety laws to come in. </sentence><sentence id="4325">The three... the publicity in <span class="populated place">Selma</span>, in <span class="populated place">Birmingham</span> with the water hoses. </sentence><sentence id="4326">It all, I think, helped mobilize the <span class="country">country</span> to change things. </sentence><sentence id="4327">We started, I mean I think the conviction of the civil rights workers in 1964, which took a great deal of help by this all-white jury in <span class="region">Mississippi</span> and by, where you had a presiding federal judge, who was clearly a segregationist: Senator Eastland's roommate, Judge Cox**. </sentence><sentence id="4328">I think he said, "This is enough, and he's going to have a fair trial." </sentence><sentence id="4329">And that was a little step along the way. </sentence><sentence id="4330">It took a great deal of work. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5249">Q: What's your response to that kind of remark? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5251">A: Well, I mean, I think it's the same sort of driving force, in a way, that says they are, historically have valued education, and have seen that if you get an education, that you are motivated to succeed and you can be someone. </sentence><sentence id="5252">And I think African-Americans see that, too. </sentence><sentence id="5253">But I think, I think, as I say, part of it is a vicious circle, part of it is, that's what Jean does, sometimes it's one at a time, that people who are born into these poor economic circumstances, we have a whole generation, we have several generations of welfare in <span class="region">Eastern Kentucky</span> and in the <span class="region">South</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5254">And it's hard to break that cycle in a variety of situations, people, and we... I don't know that welfare reform isn't all bad. </sentence><sentence id="5255">It can be done, in my mind, and I think Jean's, in a more humane way. </sentence><sentence id="5256">But people have to have some support systems, and if you come out from, if you have a series of generations where education isn't valued, for example in <span class="region">Eastern Kentucky</span> you could get a very good job mining coal, you didn't need an education for years and years and generations, all you had to do... I mean, it was hard work, dangerous work in some ways. </sentence><sentence id="5257">But it was the kind of work that people knew. </sentence><sentence id="5258">It was all manual labor. </sentence><sentence id="5259">As that ends, people don't have those jobs, and they don't have the options, they find themselves in those situations where there is disparity, they have to leave. </sentence><sentence id="5260">And I think the black, in the <span class="region">South</span>, you have the history of segregation for a couple of hundred years, where you don't have equal opportunity. </sentence><sentence id="5261">Where you have terrible <span class="building">schools</span>, and where you're expected to be a sharecropper, really don't have an equal opportunity. </sentence><sentence id="5262">Then you can't have, those children can't have the expectations of being successful. </sentence><sentence id="5263">Now people debate that nationally. </sentence><sentence id="5264">Black leaders debate that, you hear it all the time. " </sentence><sentence id="5265">We can be successful. </sentence><sentence id="5266">We should not have Affirmative Action." </sentence><sentence id="5267">I think Affirmative Action has been a very successful tool. </sentence><sentence id="5268">But the pendulum has swung. </sentence><sentence id="5269">Now you find Justice Thomas*, and you find black leaders who say, "Affirmative Action is unfair. </sentence><sentence id="5270">It's unfair to whites. </sentence><sentence id="5271">It's unfair in that it gives, we don't need an unfair advantage," or to label it as an unfair advantage. </sentence><sentence id="5272">To some extent it's subjective. </sentence><sentence id="5273">Those are my own feelings about... I think you do have to make additional opportunities available to people who have been historically discriminated against. </sentence><sentence id="5274">We have had it and to try to isolate that advantage to those very few situations where you can actually prove that this <span class="building">company</span> discriminated in this bad way and so they're supposed to overcome that. </sentence><sentence id="5275">But I don't, and I don't think my dad, anymore than anybody else, was... I certainly wish he had been more broadminded about that, I'm just saying he's not perfect, none of us are perfect and he had his imperfections and that was one of them. </sentence><sentence id="5276">As far as philosophically, he didn't go around making speeches about it. </sentence><sentence id="5277">But I think he was still proud of what I was doing. </sentence><sentence id="5278">I think it was easy, he would be the first, among others, he would say, "Well they should be, certainly not prevent people," think it was wrong to try to enforce the right to vote or even the right to go to <span class="building">public facilities</span> or to have the same legal rights as everyone else. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5317">A: (Talkover.) </sentence><sentence id="5318">It's the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="5319">I mean it is essentially the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="5320">In a different way. </sentence><sentence id="5321">I mean it's the mistreatment of blacks, maybe it isn't genocide, but there were certainly the lynching periods when many blacks were killed. </sentence><sentence id="5322">Not in the scale that we're used to here, that was true in the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="5323">But I think it's the same thing that motivates, helped to motivate me to work there. </sentence><sentence id="5324">And work in <span class="building">legal services</span>, where you're essentially trying to do something similar to that on an individual basis. </sentence><sentence id="5325">To provide those opportunities so that people are at least even in the <span class="building">courts</span> and that they can find lawyers to advocate their positions, which they, in the <span class="building">courts</span>, which they otherwise wouldn't be able to do. </sentence><sentence id="5326">And I've said many times, I think it's the mark of, a good mark, one of the things that this <span class="country">country</span> ought to be proud of, is the fact that it does fund programs like ours, so that people, and provide lawyers to low-income people. </sentence><sentence id="5327">And even makes it possible to sue the government if necessary, that biting the hand that feeds you, if you have to. </sentence><sentence id="5328">You don't have to do that as much as we did. </sentence><sentence id="5329">But we don't get the funds that we ought to have, that's regrettable. </sentence><sentence id="5330">Just as regrettable as it was that it took so long to get to the days of the civil rights, it took... Brown against the <span class="building">Board of Education</span> is 1954 and we aren't fully at the end of it yet, with regard to higher education. </sentence><sentence id="5331">It takes thirty and forty years. </sentence><sentence id="5332">Court processes are slow. </sentence><sentence id="5333">But I think it all has to do with human rights, treating people, giving everyone the same opportunity, whether they are young or old, or white or black, or... whoever. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5359">A: I met Jean in the <span class="building">Civil Rights Division</span> of the <span class="building">Department of Justice</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5360">She was, I was the Deputy of the <span class="region">Southeastern Section</span>, which handled <span class="populated place">Alabama</span>, <span class="region">Mississippi</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5361">No <span class="populated place">Alabama</span> and not <span class="region">Mississippi</span>, then. </sentence><sentence id="5362">My section chief was Frank Dunbaugh(tm) and Jean came to the <span class="interior space">section</span> as a research analyst, which she mentioned to you. </sentence><sentence id="5363">They are now called <span class="building">paralegals</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5364">We call them also administrative representatives here. </sentence><sentence id="5365">They do a little different work in my <span class="building">organization</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5366">But John Doar was invited to speak at <span class="building">Earlham College</span>* in Jean's senior year, or maybe her junior year. </sentence><sentence id="5367">Her roommate, Dorothy, now Landsberg, was then named Shelton, was in charge of the speaking program, and for some reason she had heard about John Doar's work and asked him to come to <span class="populated place">Earlham</span> to speak. </sentence><sentence id="5368">And he came there and then he, I believe first hired Dorothy for the summer to work for him and he also met Jean. </sentence><sentence id="5369">Or she came to, or she came to <span class="populated place">Washington</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5370">I don't know whether he hired her then. </sentence><sentence id="5371">They were about, they were the two, I think, the first research analysts. </sentence><sentence id="5372">Dorothy later on after I... and so, Jean came to this <span class="region">section</span> and we began working together. </sentence><sentence id="5373">Of course we were sort of... I was second in charge of the <span class="region">section</span> and she was working on cases, and so | think we once... a group of us went on a skiing trip and that was the first time we had any opportunity to be together socially. " </sentence><sentence id="5374">Cause we were still I guess drawing some <span class="dlf">lines</span> when we were at work. </sentence><sentence id="5375">She was just a new employee and working under, not directly under me, but with some other lawyers in preparing cases. </sentence><sentence id="5376">What they would do is  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 72 analyze the documents, like the voting records we brought back. </sentence><sentence id="5377">We similarly started doing the same thing with <span class="building">schools</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5378">Normally in a <span class="building">school</span> desegregation case, someone like Jean might go into the <span class="building">Superintendent's office</span> under a court order or voluntarily and start analyzing where the white students and the black students in the <span class="region">county</span> lived and why they were not being assigned... say, it was pretty apparent in the segregated school systems that you'd have, especially where there was bussing, that black children would need to pass a <span class="building">white school</span> to be assigned to their <span class="building">black school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5379">And to put those patterns together and to analyze how the <span class="building">school system</span> assigned students deliberately, so that white students would be together and black students would continue to be together. </sentence><sentence id="5380">Or route <span class="spatial object">buses</span> in a way that made sure that <span class="building">schools</span> remained segregated. </sentence><sentence id="5381">So they were really analyzing those records, which they would then present to the lawyers. </sentence><sentence id="5382">And the same thing in employment cases, whether, you know, in a large <span class="building">factory</span>, where you looked at the number of applicants for jobs and determined that a black was passed over, even though, let's say that maybe he had made an application to get to a particular job and the company said, "Well you weren't qualified," in another <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5383">By looking at several of those situations you could look, you'd only know from the records whether the person who was actually put in had the qualifications or not, or whether they passed over someone who was black, or they didn't, the black who had applied was obviously qualified, or less qualified than the person they hired. </sentence><sentence id="5384">That kind of analysis, which was then given to the lawyers. </sentence><sentence id="5385">So, that's what Jean was hired to do. </sentence><sentence id="5386">And then we, later on when we were, she had worked there about a year... well, let's see. </sentence><sentence id="5387">It might not have even been a year. </sentence><sentence id="5388">When we went to <span class="region">Alabama</span> on this voting rights case, the Jim Clark case, Jean was there with me. </sentence><sentence id="5389">She was involved in some records analysis. </sentence><sentence id="5390">And I almost, we were not yet married, but I almost had to put her on the <span class="spatial object">stand</span>, but I didn't. </sentence><sentence id="5391">And there were a couple of other situations where she ended up in a place where, in a case that I was working on, where we began to suspect that John Doar was deliberately sending her to cases that I was working on, since we had started dating or people knew that we had sort of started dating. </sentence><sentence id="5392">So, after we worked on this case involving Jim Clark, we went over to, it was sort of a night and day affair. </sentence><sentence id="5393">She was telling you that we had this unfortunate situation where Lois Baker, who was our secretary. </sentence><sentence id="5394">We hired the first probably, black secretary. </sentence><sentence id="5395">We had an <span class="building">office</span> in <span class="populated place">Selma</span>, <span class="region">Alabama</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5396">There was a lawyer from the <span class="building">Civil Rights Division</span>, named Chad Quaintance, who was the first lawyer that we had in a <span class="building">field office</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5397">He and his family moved to <span class="populated place">Selma</span> and were there. </sentence><sentence id="5398">And <span class="country">Chad</span> hired Lois Baker as a secretary and she was an African- American. </sentence><sentence id="5399">She was the one who had these epileptic seizures. </sentence><sentence id="5400">She was just very young. </sentence><sentence id="5401">I think she was only about nineteen. </sentence><sentence id="5402">I went back to <span

get-together. </sentence><sentence id="5404">And it happened that I was going to <span class="populated place">Birmingham</span> for a legal services meeting and one of the lawyers who works in my program, Larry York, and I went over to <span class="populated place">Selma</span> for a couple of days. </sentence><sentence id="5405">There was a... they have a small <span class="building">voting rights museum</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="5406">There were some people around who we visited and I visited Lois, who had since gotten married and had two, several children. </sentence><sentence id="5407">And we were thinking back...She's the head of the <span class="interior space">computer section</span> at <span class="building">Montgomery Air Force Base</span> or something at this point in time. </sentence><sentence id="5408">But after that Jean and I went over to <span class="populated place">Montgomery</span> and helped work on another, on a <span

started dating. </sentence><sentence id="5418">And then after working together so much, I think we just decided, I just asked her to see if she didn't think we ought to get married.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5669">A: Well as Jean told you, she was there without me with the both of them facing each other for a little while, so I guess they were a little bit new to each other. </sentence><sentence id="5670">But her father is a pretty extroverted person, who has a lot of interests and was then much younger, quite young. </sentence><sentence id="5671">Was very interested in spiritual things and I think my dad was able to talk to him. </sentence><sentence id="5672">And they got along very well. </sentence><sentence id="5673">And Jean's mother and my mother hit it off really well. </sentence><sentence id="5674">I think Jean's mother had been a secretary and was always doing transcription work of one sort or another. </sentence><sentence id="5675">And in fact, in the last fifteen years or so she would not, well after we were married, Jean's mother wouldn't take a full time job, she worked for <span class="building">Manpower</span>", so they could come down and see Michael or be with the grandson and then the grandchildren. </sentence><sentence id="5676">We were both, in the sense that her father's background was German and was the son of a tailor immigrant family. </sentence><sentence id="5677">His mother was very strong. </sentence><sentence id="5678">He grew up in <span class="populated place">New York City</span> at a time when much of <span class="populated place">downtown New York</span> was still <span class="dlf">farm</span>, <span class="region">farming country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5679">There are some old letters in her family that I was reading when I was <span class="building">home</span>, where they were describing the winter and it was cold and they'd have to go outside to the <span class="building">outhouse</span> to relieve themselves. </sentence><sentence id="5680">And they were literally living in a <span class="region">farming area</span> where the <span class="building">United Nations Building</span> is now. </sentence><sentence id="5681">But the point was that they were sort of both from old European generation backgrounds, where the fathers were working and more sort of the dominant, and they were making the money and the mothers were at <span class="building">home</span>, and the <span class="building">household</span> was sort of run the way the fathers said it was run. </sentence><sentence id="5682">And in that way, I think, there was some commonality, even if the religions weren't the same and the families got off to a pretty good start. </sentence><sentence id="5683">They didn't stay very long on that occasion and I don't remember, I mean they saw, saw each other periodically and from time to time. </sentence><sentence id="5684">Jean's parents used to, as she said, came to visit us a lot more. </sentence><sentence id="5685">They came down here a lot. </sentence><sentence id="5686">They really took a major interest in their grandchildren. </sentence><sentence id="5687">My parents had moved to <span class="region">Florida</span> and did not really come up, they made a trip up after we moved here from <span class="region">North Carolina</span>, when they were still living in <span class="populated place">Gastonia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5688">As I said my father, "65, let's say in 1966... Let's see, we got married in "67. </sentence><sentence id="5689">He retired about that time and they moved to <span class="region">Florida</span> shortly thereafter. </sentence><sentence id="5690">So that we would go see them usually at Christmas. </sentence><sentence id="5691">But they didn't make many trips up. </sentence><sentence id="5692">Right after we moved to <span class="populated place">Prestonsburg</span> they made a, they drove over, got as far as <span class="populated place">Pikeville</span> and the <span class="dlf">four-lane</span> was just being developed, was being blasted open between <span class="populated place">Pikeville</span> and <span class="populated place">Prestonsburg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5693">So they got within thirty miles of <span class="building">home</span> and then had to take a thirty mile detour around the back hollers from <span class="populated place">Wheelwright</span> and I don't think, I think  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 76 that sort of, was enough for them. </sentence><sentence id="5694">Although they moved to <span class="region">Florida</span>, they never really made another big driving excursion up this way. </sentence><sentence id="5695">So I don't know that I have many more, it's one of those things I don't have a lot of... Jean probably recalls better than Ido. </sentence><sentence id="5696">We went back for...after we got married and worked in the <span class="building">Civil Rights Division</span>, when Jean then, when Michael was born in 1970 in April, we had decided then to leave the <span class="building">Division</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5697">That was when the Nixon Administration had come in, and even though I was Chief of the <span class="building">Criminal Section</span>, they were not, pretty much still let me have a free hand. </sentence><sentence id="5698">The <span class="building">Houston school</span> case was one of the last cases that they filed in which the government, which I had written the pleadings in, in which we asked for bussing as a relief. </sentence><sentence id="5699">And they were generally to eliminate segregation, to start bussing black kids across to <span class="building">white schools</span> and whites to <span class="building">black schools</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5700">We didn't get all of that in the relief. </sentence><sentence id="5701">We did pair up some <span class="building">schools</span> and we made some other major improvements. </sentence><sentence id="5702">But they were, in my view, certainly, and others, were retreating on <span class="building">school</span> desegregation. </sentence><sentence id="5703">And it wasn't really... the climate was not what it had been and I, we decided then, I think, that we had been there long enough. </sentence><sentence id="5704">Besides I had been there, was in a very senior position and at that point you're starting to almost price yourself out of the <span class="building">market</span> if you want to make a career change. </sentence><sentence id="5705">You might stay with the government and decide to go, to keep, to go up another notch or two or maybe make more and more money. </sentence><sentence id="5706">Or if you're going to a <span class="building">law firm</span>, in order to get a reasonable salary, too, it was at the point where it was a good time for me to do that. </sentence><sentence id="5707">So we, and Michael had just been born, it was a nice time to take off for the summer. </sentence><sentence id="5708">And we decided then to, we would go ona large camping trip. </sentence><sentence id="5709">We got our little <span class="spatial object">car</span> and the <span class="spatial object">baby carriage</span>, and folded it. </sentence><sentence id="5710">We bought a <span class="spatial object">Peugeot</span> for eight hundred dollars that looked like it had a lot of miles left on it. </sentence><sentence id="5711">And we headed North and we went North along the American and <span class="region">Canadian coast</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5712">We went to the <span class="dlf">Canadian -- American National Parks</span>, <span class="populated place">Fundy</span> and all the way along, <span class="populated place">Cape Breton</span>, out to <span class="populated place">Cape Breton</span> and <span class="region">Prince Edward Island</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5713">Came back to <span class="populated place">Quebec</span> and basically got away from it all. </sentence><sentence id="5714">I think I had one call from a <span class="building">firm</span> and decided to leave it, not to bother with it. </sentence><sentence id="5715">And we weren't really sure where, we knew we wanted to do something useful, where I felt I was using my legal talents to somebody's benefit. </sentence><sentence id="5716">And I had talked to some <span class="building">firms</span> and that didn't really excite me at the time, but I think I was just more, we were really more into making the decision to leave, which was a big thing, because we didn't have a job. </sentence><sentence id="5717">But we wanted to get away for a while and we had some money saved up, so we, while I was on that trip one of the... when we came back... what was it?

mining without, strip mining without land owner approval. </sentence><sentence id="5769">Because these out of state mineral owners had come here in the late 1890s and bought out all the minerals. </sentence><sentence id="5770">We were talking about country people and being acceptance of outsiders. </sentence><sentence id="5771">Have you ever read Harry Caudill's book, Night Comes to the <span class="region">Cumberlands</span>? </sentence><sentence id="5772">Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="5773">Well you know, he describes this situation so well where these land agents for the Northern philanthropists, like Rockefeller and large oil holding and mineral holding companies sent their agents down here. </sentence><sentence id="5774">They would visit these farmers who lived in very remote <span class="region">hollers</span>, where they were farming the <span class="env feature">mountain hills</span>, really. </sentence><sentence id="5775">And they would come in and tell their stories, and spend the night, talk about all the good things that were going on in the world and how nice this place was. </sentence><sentence id="5776">And then they would present them, they would suggest to them that they ought to go ahead and sell over their mineral rights because it wasn't really any benefit to them that they could see. </sentence><sentence id="5777">No one knew what mining was. </sentence><sentence id="5778">There wasn't any huge deep <span class="dlf">mine</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="5779">The only use they made of their coal would be to cut into the <span class="env feature">hillside</span> enough to get the coal to use for heating up their <span class="building">cabins</span> and their <span class="building">homes</span>, which is what most of them did. </sentence><sentence id="5780">You could see the outcrop of the coal and they would run a scraper along the <span class="env feature">mountain</span> and take out a little bit of coal. </sentence><sentence id="5781">But no one... certainly they were aware as they were in other <span class="country">countries</span> of deep mining methods. </sentence><sentence id="5782">And I'm sure these agents didn't talk a great deal about the possibility of having a huge, deep <span class="dlf">mine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5783">This was in the 1890s, 1900s, was before the time of the <span class="dlf">railroads</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5784">And subsequently the <span class="dlf">railroads</span> came in once all these minerals had been bought up, I mean they literally bought up all of the mineral ownership in <span class="region">Eastern Kentucky</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5785">And under the common law, the <span class="dlf">mineral estate</span> is severed from the <span class="region">surface</span>, so what you have left is the <span class="env feature">land</span> on top. </sentence><sentence id="5786">And they gave them, the deeds they signed as you know, were known as Broad Form Deeds because they were so broad in their language. </sentence><sentence id="5787">They literally gave the owner of the minerals the right to take the minerals and all steps reasonably necessary to build <span class="dlf">roads</span> and <span class="dlf">railroads</span> and <span class="dlf">tram roads</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5788">Whatever might be necessary that's incidental to taking out the coal. </sentence><sentence id="5789">And then they would sign those minerals away. </sentence><sentence id="5790">And the <span class="building">Kentucky courts</span> held that those deeds were so broad that they gave the mineral owner the paramount right to the surface owner, as long as the mineral owner didn't arbitrarily misuse that right. </sentence><sentence id="5791">As long as he mined by reasonable methods and took the coal out by an acceptable method, the surface owner could not object to that. </sentence><sentence id="5792">So those, Joe had one of those old deeds and told me what an awful instrument was, that even though at the time when they executed the deeds, no one could have envisioned these current methods of mining. </sentence><sentence id="5793"><span class="spatial object">Bulldozer</span>, mechanic... and these huge, mechanized equipment that was in use seventy-five years later, that the <span class="building">courts</span> would hold that to be allowable. </sentence><sentence id="5794">In most contract law, the contract applies to those things that are within the reasonable contemplation of the parties, like deep mining. </sentence><sentence id="5795">There was no doubt that if you were going to mine back then you would deep mine to get the coal out. </sentence><sentence id="5796">We never challenged that. </sentence><sentence id="5797">But the notion that they could use a method that was not at all in anybody's contemplation was rejected in other <span class="region">states</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5798">Virtually. </sentence><sentence id="5799">I mentioned <span class="region">West Virginia</span> a while ago, I guess that wasn't really right. </sentence><sentence id="5800">The <span class="building">West Virginia courts</span> had said you have to have landowner consent. </sentence><sentence id="5801">You could get a surface mining permit and you could pay for that. </sentence><sentence id="5802">And that was what <span class="region">Pennsylvania</span>, and <span class="region">Ohio</span>, and many of these others, <span class="region">Illinois</span>, all the other <span class="region">states</span>, <span class="building">courts</span> had said, but not <span class="region">Kentucky</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5803">So Joe, we talked for  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 79 a long time, was pointing out, also how poor people couldn't get lawyers to challenge those deeds. </sentence><sentence id="5804">And they couldn't get lawyers to challenge a permit application if someone applied for a permit. </sentence><sentence id="5805">But there were many situations where he thought it would be just a wonderful thing if we could have lawyers available to represent poor people. </sentence><sentence id="5806">Because he saw these situations coming up so often. </sentence><sentence id="5807">And so, we went on, we went on to <span class="region">Florida</span> to visit my mom and dad and while on the way I think we kind of decided that this would be an interesting opportunity to try to come to <span class="region">Eastern Kentucky</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5808">It would be a worthwhile way to practice law and to provide that opportunity. </sentence><sentence id="5809">There was a lot of interesting work to be done and useful and perhaps important work to do on behalf of low-income clients. </sentence><sentence id="5810">And also to help start this legal services program, which was, had sort of a small beginning in mountain people's rights. </sentence><sentence id="5811">So then we came...decided to come, and we came. </sentence><sentence id="5812">And moved to <span class="populated place">Prestonsburg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5813">At first I looked around in <span class="populated place">Barbourville</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5814">We had a little tough time getting off the <span class="env feature">ground</span>, because the, we had some disagreements about how to do this the best way. </sentence><sentence id="5815">Some people, some of the mountain people's rights members thought that it was more important to organize, to organize work with low- income groups like the Welfare Rights Group, rather than doing lawyering work. </sentence><sentence id="5816">So it wasn't quite as smooth sailing getting started as I had hoped. </sentence><sentence id="5817">But after a little while we got on our way and Joe Begley's son, J. T. Begley, who had just gotten out of the Marines and gone back to <span class="building">law school</span>, turned out to be the first lawyer that I hired. </sentence><sentence id="5818">And I hired a fellow named Mort Stamm, who is now in <span class="country">Australia</span>, teaching. </sentence><sentence id="5819">And we started off with, then a fellow named Paul Fauri, who is the Domestic Relations Commissioner in <span class="populated place">Franklin County</span>, and we started in that little <span class="building">house</span> I pointed out to you on the way up here. </sentence><sentence id="5820">So, that's how it began. </sentence><sentence id="5821">And I was telling you, it wasn't an easy beginning. </sentence><sentence id="5822">I think the <span class="building">Bar Associations</span> were very suspicious and I think they were threatened and thought really we were going to compete with lawyers for clients that would be able to pay. </sentence><sentence id="5823">And then some, many lawyers, who were employed or retained by coal companies were not particularly sympathetic to the notion that lawyers might start to challenge some of these practices and give people representation in the <span class="building">courts</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5824">So we were not the most popular people in <span class="populated place">town</span> when we started. </sentence><sentence id="5825">I had difficulty renting an <span class="building">office</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5826">Finally found an <span class="building">office</span> in the place where Jean and I ended up living for a long time on the other side of <span class="populated place">town</span>, within a week of each other. </sentence><sentence id="5827">And we got started. </sentence><sentence id="5828">It was also a difficult time because at the national level, President Nixon had an Office of Economic Opportunity Director, who was opposed to legal services, bringing any of these sort of controversial cases against public officials, and challenging welfare rights practices and that sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="5829">And he, he decided to, he wanted to de-fund those programs. </sentence><sentence id="5830">So I had only been here about a year when all of that began in 1973 and it looked like we might lose our money. </sentence><sentence id="5831">We had half of the lawyers were on half salaries and the secretary, we had to hire, we got a lawyer in <span class="populated place">Washington</span>, Steve Pollak, I mentioned to you, I used to work with, to represent us to threaten to sue <span class="building">OEO</span> to get our funding. </sentence><sentence id="5832">Some other programs similarly went through a period of that sort. </sentence><sentence id="5833">Governor Reagan at that time, who would become President, had sort of declared war on legal services in <span class="region">California</span>, who had represented migrant farm workers and had also won some fairly major welfare decisions with regard to hearing rights. </sentence><sentence id="5834">And had showed that the <span class="building">California welfare system</span> was violating the rights of welfare recipients and applicants. </sentence><sentence id="5835">And he was angry and tried to start, established an inquiry, <span class="building">tribunal</span> out in <span class="region">California</span>, that sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="5836">Actually the <span class="building">tribunal</span> came out with a report, this included some judges, that was very favorable to CRLA. </sentence><sentence id="5837">Then when Reagan became President, he decided to do it all over again. </sentence></p></dialogue>

are here. </sentence><sentence id="6019">But fortunately we managed to weather those storms, and we were able to, and in 19... we were able to reach an accommodation with legal services actually, in that 1973 when we were represented by Steve Pollak and we sort of severed our ties to <span class="region">West Virginia</span> by establishing a separate <span class="building">corporation</span> here. </sentence><sentence id="6020">I mean it was... and they established, we added "of <span class="region">Kentucky</span>" at the end of our name. </sentence><sentence id="6021">We're still very good friends with the people in <span class="region">West Virginia</span> and some of the work we do is the same. </sentence><sentence id="6022">But in <span class="region">West Virginia</span> they ended up establishing a judicare program, which is a program where cases are sent to the <span class="building">private bar</span>, instead of a staff attorney. </sentence><sentence id="6023">And you have a small <span class="building">central office</span> and the cases are... and then you contract with lawyers. </sentence><sentence id="6024">It tends to be a lot more expensive. </sentence><sentence id="6025">But <span class="building">Appalred</span>'s <span class="building">office</span> did maintain intact in <span class="region">West Virginia</span>, just with a fewer

year. </sentence><sentence id="6029">And between 1975 and 1978 we expanded from the single <span class="building">office</span> here in <span class="populated place">Prestonsburg</span> to the ten

</sentence><sentence id="6033">We represented a lot of people in everyday problems with family law, consumer rights, housing problems. </sentence><sentence id="6034">And we did some of the larger challenges involved in, with regard to the <span class="dlf">coal mines</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6035">We found out that the <span class="building">agencies</span> that governed all of these programs were not really very responsive at times. </sentence><sentence id="6036">The state's <span class="building">Mine Safety and Health Administration</span> did not do a good job in protecting the rights of coal miners. </sentence><sentence id="6037">So we saw that when miners were fired because they complained about unsafe conditions. </sentence><sentence id="6038">I mean, that that's what would happen to them if they complained. </sentence><sentence id="6039">And so we were able to start representing them to get their jobs back and to get damages for them. </sentence><sentence id="6040">And then in the <span class="region">environmental area</span> we represented numbers of people who were challenging surface mining permits because they posed dangers to their <span

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6085">A: I was just saying that the constitutional amendment was passed in 1988, so it was introduced in nineteen, I guess in the 1988 legislative session. </sentence><sentence id="6086">And it was passed by ninety-two percent of the voters. </sentence><sentence id="6087">It was a great publicity campaign by <span class="building">KFTC</span>, a lot of letters to the editor, it sort of put them on the map. </sentence><sentence id="6088">We had started <span class="building">KFTC</span> with a small group in <span class="populated place">Hazard</span>, <span class="region">Kentucky</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6089">A group of citizens came together to talk about fair taxation of minerals, initially. </sentence><sentence id="6090">Because the coal under the <span class="env feature">ground</span>, not only did the land owner not have the opportunity to object to whether they could be surface mining or not, but they were paying virtually all the taxes on the <span class="dlf">property</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6091">They were not... and the <span class="populated place">Kentucky</span> constitution said that all properties, cash... is taxed in fair cash value. </sentence><sentence id="6092">But the minerals weren't being taxed. </sentence><sentence id="6093">So the group looked at that and decided that they would try to start an organization called the Kentucky Fair Tax Coalition. </sentence><sentence id="6094">I've even been credited with giving, we were sitting around the <span class="interior space">room</span> trying to decide what should this thing be called?People were throwing up names. ( </sentence><sentence id="6095">Laughing.) </sentence><sentence id="6096">Somebody said, I think it was, whatever the various combinations people had been throwing out, was that I suggested it be called Kentuckians Fair Tax Coalition. </sentence><sentence id="6097">But the other issue it took on was the Broad Form Deed. </sentence><sentence id="6098">And the group started very small, it was just kind of a get together really. </sentence><sentence id="6099">One of the members who, one of the folks who was there was a young man named Joe Zakos, who had come from <span class="region">Pennsylvania</span> and was interested in working with local citizens groups. </sentence><sentence id="6100">And he had come, was living in <span class="populated place">David</span>, I think and had gotten involved in some issues over in <span class="region">Martin County</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6101">It didn't have anything to do with the Broad Form Deed. </sentence><sentence id="6102">It was really a proposal to move a <span class="populated place">low-income community</span> out of a <span class="region">flood-prone area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6103">And they were going to fill it in and put in new <span class="building">housing</span> or <span class="building">industrial</span>... the only thing was they forgot to discuss it with the people who were living there. </sentence><sentence id="6104">And he organized an effort there to... which ultimately stopped that. </sentence><sentence id="6105">They backed off on that project. </sentence><sentence id="6106">But in the process began a group called the <span class="populated place">Martin County</span> Concerned Citizens, who then were involved with a number of environmental and socially active, social... got involved in issues of social concern. </sentence><sentence id="6107">We represented them one year in a case challenging the application of... <span class="building">Kentucky Power</span> wanted to build another <span class="building">power generating plant</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6108">And the reason they wanted to build it was to sell more power to other <span class="building">companies</span>, but it would have raised the rates of everyone, including the <span class="populated place">Martin County</span> citizens, people who lived in that <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6109">And we had a lawyer in legal services in <span class="populated place">Lexington</span>, Tony Martin, who focused on energy work, and basically demonstrated that there was no need for the <span class="building">power plant</span>, that all it was going to do was increase everybody's power bill. </sentence><sentence id="6110">They had plenty of generating power, they were just trying to expand themselves. </sentence><sentence id="6111">And the stockholders might benefit, but the <span class="populated place">Martin County</span> citizen group was the named party. </sentence><sentence id="6112">And so that was just to say that, even though a group that was called Kentucky Fair Tax Coalition and decided later to rename itself Kentuckians for the Commonwealth, because local chapters were working on different issues of local concern. </sentence><sentence id="6113">Didn't necessarily involve minerals and that sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="6114">But they really put themselves on the <span class="dlf">map</span> with the campaign to get the constitutional amendment passed. </sentence><sentence id="6115">So that amendment was on the ballot in 1988, along with the lottery. </sentence><sentence id="6116">And the lottery barely passed. </sentence><sentence id="6117">It passed by, I think, fifty-one or - two percent of the vote. </sentence><sentence id="6118">Ninety-two percent of the vote, people voted for the Broad Form Deed amendment, which showed people knew what they were doing. </sentence><sentence id="6119">In fact, I remember when, early when we had been here not too many years, the <span class="building">Courier-Journal</span> | think did an informal poll. </sentence><sentence id="6120">And something like ninety-three percent of the people thought they shouldn't allow anybody to 81 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="6121">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="6122"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 82 strip mine your <span class="region">land</span> without your consent. </sentence><sentence id="6123">But I was then, one of my, the <span class="building">coal industry</span> decided they wanted to challenge the constitutionality of that constitutional amendment as violating the federal constitution. </sentence><sentence id="6124">Because they claimed that mineral ownership rights had been established by these series of Kentucky cases in the <span class="building">Supreme Court</span> over the years and that people when they bought mineral rights expected to be able to legally surface mine. </sentence><sentence id="6125">And we argued... and I was representing an older couple in <span class="populated place">Johnson County</span>, <span class="populated place">Garnet</span> and <span class="populated place">Eugene Ward</span>, who lived on a small <span class="dlf">farm</span>... they really weren't farming. </sentence><sentence id="6126">It was in a <span class="dlf">holler</span> that had not been mined. </sentence><sentence id="6127">And there was a mining application by a <span class="building">company</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6128">And at the <span class="building">trial court</span>, one of the attorneys who was here then was handling, handled that case, and it was on appeal and it came to me and I took the case over. </sentence><sentence id="6129">And we ended up arguing the constitutionality of the amendment in the <span class="building">Supreme Court</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6130">And the Attorney General argued in our support and the <span class="building">court</span> then agreed with our theory that they never had the right in the first place to grant the right to strip mine. </sentence><sentence id="6131">So it took a lot of years, but finally the right was... you cannot today surface mine anybody's <span class="region">land</span> without their consent. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6181">Q: When did that final decision come down? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6183">A: I think it was 1990. </sentence><sentence id="6184">The <span class="building">Supreme Court</span> decision was stated in 1990. </sentence><sentence id="6185">Ward versus, Ward versus... I forgot the last name for the moment. </sentence><sentence id="6186">I can talk about that case a long time, but that's sort of the summary. </sentence><sentence id="6187">Garnet, now both of the <span class="region">Wards</span>... Eugene died while we were in the <span class="building">Supreme Court</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6188">And then Garnet died a couple of years back. </sentence><sentence id="6189">She was a very feisty woman. </sentence><sentence id="6190">She claimed... they never, no one else had ever paid any taxes on this <span class="dlf">property</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6191">And they didn't know that anybody else had any claim to the minerals. </sentence><sentence id="6192">She thought they owned the claim. </sentence><sentence id="6193">When we were in <span class="building">circuit court</span> we asserted that, and there was some basis for her claim, because when the minerals were sold, about 1910, really interesting, by... the local owner, the owner was in <span class="populated place">Johnson County</span> and he sold the mineral rights to a company in <span class="populated place">New York</span>, that wanted to develop these minerals. </sentence><sentence id="6194">And he sold... and they promised to pay him with... they gave him shares of stock and said they would buy those shares back once their company was in operation. </sentence><sentence id="6195">And a year went by and nothing happened, so he sued them to get his money. </sentence><sentence id="6196">And actually in that suit someone, a deposition of him was taken. </sentence><sentence id="6197">And when he sold that <span class="dlf">property</span> he said, "I will give you the minerals and you may mine that <span class="dlf">property</span>, but I want you to leave all the walnut, chestnut, and <span class="env feature">hemlock trees</span> over ten inches," which made it impossible to strip mine. </sentence><sentence id="6198">And so we actually argued initially it was not a Broad Form Deed, that this deed specifically was limited to deep mining because it was impossible to strip mine, because he had said that. </sentence><sentence id="6199">And on deposition, which was... the deposition from his testimony was still in the <span class="building">courthouse</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6200">And in the deposition he reasserted that, that he wanted those <span class="env feature">trees</span> left alone. </sentence><sentence id="6201">And that you could use the smaller timbers as people did in deep <span class="dlf">mines</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6202"><span class="spatial object">Timbers</span> under ten inches were used for shorings in the deep mine workings. </sentence><sentence id="6203">So that made good sense. </sentence><sentence id="6204">He was saying, "You can have the saplings, but I want those good <span class="env feature">trees</span> left." </sentence><sentence id="6205">So our local judge agreed with that and said, "You can't mine." </sentence><sentence id="6206">So they appealed to the <span class="building">Court of Appeals</span> and they won. </sentence><sentence id="6207">The <span class="building">Court of Appeals</span>, the <span class="building">intermediate appellate court</span> said, "Well that's just what these deed provisions say, but the mineral owner still has the paramount right to mine under our decisions." </sentence><sentence id="6208">So then we took that case to the <span class="building">Supreme Court</span> on discretionary review. </sentence><sentence id="6209">We asked them to review that. </sentence><sentence id="6210">They took the case and so the amendment was argued, we argued the amendment on that. </sentence><sentence id="6211">So Garnet, they never, they did not... anyway, when these minerals were sold, he did some, there was very careful, plats were laid out and surveyed. </sentence><sentence id="6212">And it was not, and when they

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6290">A: <span class="populated place">David</span> is about nine miles from <span class="populated place">Prestonsburg</span> and in the 1930s, especially, it was a booming <span class="populated place">coal town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6291">It was what they called a <span class="building">model community</span>, sort of like <span class="building">Wheelwright</span>, or many of these coal, you know most... <span class="populated place">Floyd county</span> and this <span class="region">area</span> had a number of <span class="populated place">coal camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6292">They were basically <span class="populated place">company towns</span>, because a company owned the <span class="building">homes</span> where the people lived and the company paid them with scrip. </sentence><sentence id="6293">And they owed their soul to the <span class="building">company store</span>, as it were. </sentence><sentence id="6294">But some of the <span class="building">homes</span> were quite nice. </sentence><sentence id="6295">I mean, I think they were very nice <span class="populated place">communities</span> and very close <span class="populated place">communities</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6296">There were some <span class="building">employers</span> that were better than others. </sentence><sentence id="6297">And there were the mine wars in <span class="populated place">Harlan County</span>, all of the difficult history involving unionization. </sentence><sentence id="6298">Where it was successful, and where it wasn't. </sentence><sentence id="6299">But David, the <span class="dlf">mine</span> there was the <span class="building">Princess Coal Company</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6300">And David was mentioned, was named for a fellow named David Francis, who when I came here, lived in <span class="populated place">Huntington</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6301">He still, that family owned the minerals. </sentence><sentence id="6302">The only <span class="dlf">swimming pool</span> in this <span class="region">area</span>, in this end of <span class="populated place">town</span> was at <span class="populated place">David</span> and people used to go out there to go swimming on the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6303">They had a little <span class="building">airport</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6304">They had a <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6305">It was a very vibrant <span class="populated place">mining community</span> and when the <span class="dlf">mine</span> closed in the "40s, it kind of went downhill. </sentence><sentence

<span class="dlf">ridge</span> around it and the <span class="building">homes</span> that were there were, was purchased by a small group of businessmen here in <span class="populated place">Prestonsburg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6307">And people paid rent to them. </sentence><sentence id="6308">And a group of Catholic priests from <span class="building">St. Vincent's

approached by the businessmen to see if the mission was interested in buying the <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6312">I think they viewed themselves as absentee landlords and all they did was collect the rent. </sentence><sentence id="6313">They saw the <span class="dlf">water system</span> going downhill. </sentence><sentence id="6314">They didn't really, weren't interested in developing the <span class="populated place">community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6315">The <span class="building">homes</span> were in pretty bad shape. </sentence><sentence id="6316">They weren't really slum lords, they just weren't doing anything to keep it up. </sentence><sentence id="6317">It was a <span class="dlf">private water system</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6318">So the Father, Matthew at the time, one day came to see me, and told us about the offer to buy the <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6319">They weren't interested in doing it, but they wondered whether we could, whether the <span class="populated place">community</span> might be able to buy it in some way, if they, we could figure out how to, help them figure out how to do that. </sentence><sentence id="6320">So, I asked a law student to do some research and we got a little help from the <span class="building">National Economic Development Law Center</span>". </sentence><sentence id="6321">And we decided, we put together an economic development, a corporation, a Kentucky corporation. </sentence><sentence id="6322">And we started having some community meetings in <span class="populated place">David</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6323">And there was a company... the <span class="populated place">town</span> wasn't working, but <span class="building">Island Creek Coal Company</span> still had a <span class="building">store</span> that they owned. </sentence><sentence id="6324">The old <span class="building">company store</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6325">There was a fellow named Tiller(r)", who ran the <span class="building">store</span> and who also, he read the Wall Street Journal. </sentence><sentence id="6326">And he was a very smart guy. </sentence><sentence id="6327">He was an interesting man. </sentence><sentence id="6328">So, they elected him as Chair of this group. </sentence><sentence id="6329">And he became the first Chair of our little <span class="building">community development corporation</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6330">We didn't own anything yet, but they started planning. </sentence><sentence id="6331">We started looking into the possibility of financing the purchasing of the <span class="populated place">town</span> and how it might work. </sentence><sentence id="6332">The problem was there was no water, the water system was unreliable. </sentence><sentence id="6333">They had a <span class="spatial object">pump</span> that was literally held together by <span class="dlf">chicken wire</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6334">They were afraid to take the gamble unless they had <span class="env feature">water</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6335">So we were sort of diverted for a couple of years until we were able to figure out with our <span class="populated place">local area development district</span> how to, ultimately we were able to get a grant, which helped one of the existing <span class="populated place">water districts</span> bring water to a number of their new customers in the <span class="region">rural part</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6336">The <span class="populated place">Beaver-Elkhorn water district</span> supplied water to a lot of the <span class="building">homes</span> on Right and Left <span class="dlf">Beaver Creek</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6337">By getting them additional, those <span class="dlf">lines</span>, they agreed they would run a <span class="dlf">line</span> over to <span class="populated place">David</span>, an extension. </sentence><sentence id="6338">And we established a <span class="building">David Water District</span> and went to the <span class="building">Public Service Commission</span> to get approval to bring water to <span class="populated place">David</span> through the <span class="building">water district</span>, which would buy its water from this <span class="building">Beaver-Elkhorn Water District</span> that agreed to extend its <span class="dlf">lines</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6339">And when we got that done, by that time Mr. Tiller had been transferred to somewhere, <span class="region">Western Kentucky</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6340">People were afraid the <span class="building">corporation</span> was going to go in, go down, because he was really sort of a driving force. </sentence><sentence id="6341">But there was an old coal miner, retired, who had black lung, named Ashland Howard, whose nickname was "Hawk". </sentence><sentence id="6342">And he had the energy and the spirit and the--even though he may not have had the formal education--to push this group along. </sentence><sentence id="6343">And he took over, became the Chair of that group. </sentence><sentence id="6344">And we then, once we got the <span class="populated place">water district</span> in, we put together a financing package, where we had a first mortgage from the <span class="building">local bank</span> here in <span class="populated place">Prestonsburg</span> and a second mortgage from a group in <span class="populated place">Washington</span>, called the Housing Assistance Council. </sentence><sentence id="6345">And the idea was that if the corporation could buy the <span class="dlf">property</span>, all of <span class="populated place">David</span>, then the renters could buy their <span class="building">homes</span> in turn and the <span class="building">local bank</span> would make those mortgages. </sentence><sentence id="6346">So the <span class="building">bank</span> would turn its money over quickly and get its mortgage paid back as people bought their <span class="building">houses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6347">And the <span class="building">Housing Assistance Council</span> in <span class="populated place">Washington</span> helped, encourages developments of this sort. </sentence><sentence id="6348">They were, I think we paid them back twice as fast. </sentence><sentence id="6349">So, we were able to purchase the <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6350">We had another lawyer, by that time I had another lawyer named Kay Adrion, who works over in <span class="region">Virginia</span> now as a private practitioner. </sentence><sentence id="6351">And she helped sort of put the deal together. </sentence><sentence id="6352">And then after the <span class="populated place">town</span>... we did all, this was a  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 85 large amount of legal work. </sentence><sentence id="6353"><span class="building">Public Service Commission</span>, all this deed work. </sentence><sentence id="6354">And we were also able to get the <span class="building">corporation</span> to realize they needed to get some staff people. </sentence><sentence id="6355">So we helped them to write a <span class="building">Vista</span> grant to get a <span class="populated place">Vista</span> out there. </sentence><sentence id="6356">At the same time a young man named Danny Greene had come to <span class="populated place">David</span> and started a, at <span class="building">home</span>, he had taken in some foster care kids. </sentence><sentence id="6357">He came down as a volunteer with the <span class="building">Mission</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6358">And he started this <span class="building">David school</span>, which over the years has obtained some national recognition for helping <span class="building">high school</span> dropouts. </sentence><sentence id="6359">He realized there was no real <span class="building">alternative school</span> here. </sentence><sentence id="6360">Kids would drop out, that was the end of it. </sentence><sentence id="6361">The <span class="building">schools</span> really just wiped their hands of them. </sentence><sentence id="6362">He bought the old <span class="building">store building</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6363">We bought most of the <span class="populated place">town</span>, <span class="dlf">ridge</span> to <span class="dlf">ridge</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6364">And he bought several others and was able to get some financing for the old <span class="building">store</span>, which became the <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6365">There's now a brand new <span class="building">building</span>, which is very beautiful, that has been built in the meantime, and the story of the <span class="building">school</span>, I've been on their Board and we've done a lot of things together. </sentence><sentence id="6366">But afterwards the corporation built and developed about twenty-five new <span class="building">homes</span>, <span class="building">Farmer's Home</span> owned... put up new <span class="building">houses</span> where the old ones were, had deteriorated in one of the hollers. </sentence><sentence id="6367">It's a very nice, attractive <span class="populated place">town</span> now. </sentence><sentence id="6368">It was sort of the <span class="env feature">Appalachian</span>, we had this big battle over a strip mining permit at one point. </sentence><sentence id="6369">There was a large <span class="dlf">block</span> of coal left underground. </sentence><sentence id="6370">I said strip mining. </sentence><sentence id="6371">There were some strip mining attempts that we were able to fend off. </sentence><sentence id="6372">But there was also a large amount of coal that had not been mined because they hit <span class="env feature">water</span> in the <span class="dlf">mine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6373">There was an attempt to re-open that, to start, to get a permit to mine that <span class="dlf">block</span> of coal. </sentence><sentence id="6374">And Danny and the <span class="populated place">community</span> got very upset about that. </sentence><sentence id="6375">And so we opposed that permit and there was a lot of community pressure, a lot of help. </sentence><sentence id="6376">And thankfully that was, we were able to fend that off. </sentence><sentence id="6377">But we've been very much, you've had deep mining and strip mining and <span class="spatial object">coal truck</span> traffic, all the problems that you see all over, in one little spot here in <span class="populated place">David</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6378">You have the <span class="building">craft co-operative</span> as a little, as a new, which has become fairly successful. </sentence><sentence id="6379">It's anice <span class="populated place">community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6380">There were actually, we had plans to develop other parts of <span class="populated place">David</span>, to expand it, but basically the community sort of decided it didn't want to get any bigger. </sentence><sentence id="6381">It's a very interesting place. </sentence><sentence id="6382">And we learned a great deal and I think had a lot to be proud of in terms of what the community did and the role that we were able to play, because they could never afford it, that sort of legal work, help. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6477">Q: Okay, we were just talking a little bit, off tape, about how many things we'd, I'd still like to cover about your time in <span class="populated place">Prestonsburg</span> and working for, working with Appalred. </sentence><sentence id="6478">And that we probably don't have the time to get into it all today. </sentence><sentence id="6479">So, I was thinking about, when we were just talking a little bit, off tape, about your time here in <span class="populated place">Prestonsburg</span>, and maybe you can reflect on your work here and a little bit on just the, what you've, it turns out that you've devoted your life to. </sentence><sentence id="6480">I mean you had the opportunity of becoming a chemical salesman and you decided that wasn't what you wanted to do. </sentence><sentence id="6481">And you've gone more and more in the direction of service. </sentence><sentence id="6482">Any reflections or words on that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6489">A: Well, I think what I'm doing now has been in many ways has been most fulfilling over the last thirty years. </sentence><sentence id="6490">Working with the <span class="building">Civil Rights Division</span> was a great opportunity to learn to practice law and to do something very worthwhile. </sentence><sentence id="6491">The big difference is that in the <span class="building">Civil Rights Division</span>, we didn't live in those <span class="populated place">communities</span> and that we came and went. </sentence><sentence id="6492">Whereas, and I have great admiration for the people who stayed there and their courage and how difficult their lives were. </sentence><sentence id="6493">The lives, the life we've had for the last thirty years in <span class="populated place">Prestonsburg</span> has been here. </sentence><sentence id="6494">And I wouldn't at all compare myself to the African-Americans who lived in those <span class="populated place">communities</span> and the life they had and how difficult that was, because we are white. </sentence><sentence id="6495">And we live in an <span class="region">area</span> where 85 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="6496">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="6497"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 86 there are very few African-Americans. </sentence><sentence id="6498">And I think their life has been difficult at times although it's gotten much better. </sentence><sentence id="6499">I mean there is also a fair amount of blatant racism in this particular <span class="region">area</span>, and some of it is direct racism. </sentence><sentence id="6500">But over the years I've been able to recruit, at least the only practicing attorney in <span class="region">Eastern Kentucky</span> right now, is the woman who has my <span class="building">office</span> in Jackson(r)!.She's been there a number of years. </sentence><sentence id="6501">And we've tried unsuccessfully to recruit some others, because they don't... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6517">Q: You're talking about African-Americans? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6519">A: Yeah, African-American lawyers, and paralegals. </sentence><sentence id="6520">You have to have a support system as a minority person to live, I think, wherever you are. </sentence><sentence id="6521">It's difficult to be alone. </sentence><sentence id="6522">And in <span class="populated place">Hazard</span> we have a <span class="building">church</span> to which Cynthia from <span class="populated place">Jackson</span> belongs. </sentence><sentence id="6523">And there are some <span class="populated place">black communities</span> that are concentrated in our <span class="region">areas</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6524">So the few people who have looked, that have really taken a little look at it, I think were, very cautious about, or were not convinced they could feel comfortable living here. </sentence><sentence id="6525">We do have a black secretary in <span class="populated place">Barbourville</span> and one in <span class="populated place">Harlan</span> and we have a paralegal in <span class="populated place">Richmond</span>, <span class="populated place">Richmond</span> having a fairly much larger <span class="populated place">African-American community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6526">But the population is about ninety-eight percent white in our <span class="region">thirty-seven counties</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6527">But I think the point I wanted to make was that we do, <span class="building">legal services offices</span> are in the <span class="populated place">communities</span> where our clients are and so you are much more associated and you are a part of that <span class="populated place">community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6528">I think we're a lot closer to our clients and you get to know your clients. </sentence><sentence id="6529">And you get to see the problems and live with the problems from day to day. </sentence><sentence id="6530">Not to say that all of us are poor, but I think after your kids, especially when your children get into the <span class="building">schools</span>, you begin to feel that you have much more of a stake in trying to develop, do something about that <span class="populated place">community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6531">You find other parents who really want the best thing for their children, even though it may be what we're doing in <span class="building">court</span> is not always popular. </sentence><sentence id="6532">Maybe our value systems are not on the same <span class="dlf">track</span> as the other lawyers who for a large part are driven by the money they are going to make in private practice. </sentence><sentence id="6533">They do some good things in private practice along the way, but generally in the <span class="building">social structure</span> people are driven by money. </sentence><sentence id="6534">So, I feel that the work we do, we represent about 7,000 clients a year and much of the work we do, whether for each of those clients, the case we help them on is the most important thing in the world, whether you've got to talk about an abused spouse or someone who's about to be evicted from an <span class="interior space">apartment</span> or someone who we're helping with social security benefits or something small, or whether we're involved in some major issue involving the Broad Form Deed or safety discrimination, the cases that tend to get the headlines. </sentence><sentence id="6535">Or working on black lung, working on trying to help make black lung regulations more responsive, little more liberal, where more than five percent of the claims are approved. </sentence><sentence id="6536">Or something like <span class="populated place">David</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6537">Each of those are a real, I think, positive contribution to helping people lead better lives and making the society a more just one. </sentence><sentence id="6538">So, I think it's, you asked me a while ago did I think we were going to be here thirty years when I came and I said I thought we'd be here maybe two or three years. </sentence><sentence id="6539">But I think the work has been so challenging and the opportunity to do this work has been a real privilege, that I always say we're fortunate at least to be paid for doing something we want to do. </sentence><sentence id="6540">And the government, state and federal governments are willing to provide funds to do it. </sentence><sentence id="6541">I think the newer, our younger lawyers give up a great deal to work for us, because they are working at very low salaries and many of them have large loan re-payments. </sentence><sentence id="6542">They start at 25,000 dollars a year and some of them have really huge debts of 80-90,000 dollars to their <span class="building">law schools</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6543">We have a small loan re-payment program  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 87 now that helps them, up to 2,000 dollars a year. </sentence><sentence id="6544">But they're the ones in a way who are, I think, making a substantial sacrifice to work. </sentence><sentence id="6545">I mean you'd hope that the government, we can do better than that. </sentence><sentence id="6546">That eventually we could work out, and develop more programs that would encourage people to spend their lives in this sort of work. </sentence><sentence id="6547">But I think it's been so, in part satisfying and challenging and all those adjectives, that I've enjoyed it.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6603">A: I remember the teacher virtually threatened him because he couldn't keep the crayons within the <span class="dlf">lines</span>, which is still a problem for some children. </sentence><sentence id="6604">I mean she was more concerned about his drawing, keeping the crayons in the <span class="dlf">lines</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6605">And what, how that would, then realizing how, what a negative reaction this could have on a child, who was basically an academically-gifted young boy. </sentence><sentence id="6606">But you know, those were... the teacher eventually left, and we, I think we were fortunate that we had some teachers who saw how bright he was and that he began, that he was able to get the best for himself, was able to do quite well. </sentence><sentence id="6607">And we had a principal who wanted, who was very interested in the best, in providing good education for mountain kids, and who encouraged Jean to help start a Gifted and Talented program in the <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6608">And he never, there wasn't a single <span class="spatial object">swing</span> on the <span class="dlf">yard</span> when we first came there. </sentence><sentence id="6609">And so we put together a little committee and gradually got a coal company to do some grading and developed a wonderful <span class="dlf">playground</span> with the PTA, on the school grounds. </sentence><sentence id="6610">And that he just, his name was John Pitts. </sentence><sentence id="6611">He couldn't figure out where he wanted to put the <span class="spatial object">swings</span>, so he hadn't put them anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="6612">But he just needed some help. </sentence><sentence id="6613">And you know, and I think as people realize that what you want is the same thing they want. </sentence><sentence id="6614">That what you're trying to do is really not a turnover, turn everything upside down, that we're filing law suits every time... but what we're trying to do is help the <span class="populated place">community</span> and be good citizens. </sentence><sentence id="6615">Then you begin to feel that people are on your side, even if the few lawyers aren't, and that we have a lot of support in this <span class="populated place">community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6616">And I remember in our PTA when the movement first started to put the Ten Commandments up on the <span class="dlf">walls</span> of the <span class="interior space">classrooms</span>, which is something that's come back today again. </sentence><sentence id="6617">I don't know if you've seen the paper, the <span class="building">Harlan County Board of Education</span> voted to put the Ten Commandments on the <span class="dlf">walls</span>, even though it's against the law and the <span class="building">Supreme Court</span> has said you cannot do that. </sentence><sentence id="6618">We had a discussion in our <span class="building">PTA</span>, a very thoughtful discussion. </sentence><sentence id="6619">And we had, there was, we had at least one family of Indians, not Native Americans, but from <span class="country">India</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6620">A surgeon, whose daughter was in Michael's class. </sentence><sentence id="6621">And, you know, there were people, initially the reaction is what's wrong with the Ten Commandments? </sentence><sentence id="6622">They're perfectly good commandments. </sentence><sentence id="6623">And you know, I could say, "Well, they're the foundation of our faith as Jews, but they may not be the foundation of our Indian friends, and religions differ. </sentence><sentence id="6624">And I would be the last person to say there's anything wrong with the Ten Commandments, but they don't belong on the <span class="dlf">wall</span> of the <span class="building">school</span> right now." </sentence><sentence id="6625">And the attorney... at the time, they were waiting for the Attorney General to come out for an opinion. </sentence><sentence id="6626">So, the resolution at that meeting was to wait until the Attorney General came out with an opinion. </sentence><sentence id="6627">And people were quite comfortable with that. </sentence><sentence id="6628">I'm sure that if we hadn't been there, and I mean the point was... that was let's see, twenty years ago, that people accepted what we had to say, and were respectful of what we had to say, and were willing to wait. </sentence><sentence id="6629">And that wouldn't be always the case, I think, where you had folks who are very strong in their... and I'm sure some of those people are, were members of fairly doctrinaire, Baptist and... <span class="building">churches</span>, but they were willing to say, "We'll wait." </sentence><sentence id="6630">And I think those things always give you some hope, I mean give you cause for feeling good about, being proud of the people you are with. </sentence><sentence id="6631">I mean I'm not always proud of everything everybody does, and you always wonder, but... So I think as we, both Jean and I, got involved in a lot of educational advocacy work, that we sort of knew we were here. </sentence><sentence id="6632">Then when our daughter, Annie, did not do well academically as she got into <span class="building">high school</span> and had a lot more... she is a very social person and was friends with people who were 88 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="6633">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="6634"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 89 very, very poor and friends with people who were quite rich. </sentence><sentence id="6635">And she had a lot of kids who were friends who were on the fringy group. </sentence><sentence id="6636">And she was in <span class="building">high school</span> and was not doing well. </sentence><sentence id="6637">So anyway, she went to the <span class="building">David School</span>, which didn't have many girls at the time and they were able to take her. </sentence><sentence id="6638">She hadn't dropped out. </sentence><sentence id="6639">She did really well there and thought the <span class="building">David School</span> was a wonderful place because of the one on one. </sentence><sentence id="6640">And she had a very good math teacher who helped her with her math. </sentence><sentence id="6641">We got her back on the right track, academically. </sentence><sentence id="6642">But it was very hard for me to take her... I mean I felt, I really wanted to stick with the <span class="building">public school</span>, public education. </sentence><sentence id="6643">But they were losing her, and she was a good example of a student who should have stayed, who had, at least then, average academic skills, but was just an example of someone that fell between the <span class="dlf">cracks</span> because the teachers were not paying attention. </sentence><sentence id="6644">Which is something, I think, we've changed. </sentence><sentence id="6645">And I think that we've always continued to be involved in these kind of efforts to try to help out our <span class="building">schools</span> and make this <span class="region">region</span> a better place. </sentence><sentence id="6646">And I think that education has a lot to do with that. </sentence><sentence id="6647">And I think we see in my work here in the <span class="building">office</span>, we do a lot of work, we represent parents of kids who have special needs and the <span class="building">schools</span> tend to, they don't want to bother with them so often, unless you have a very committed teacher, who's going to work with students like that. </sentence><sentence id="6648">It's much easier to move them out of the way. </sentence><sentence id="6649">So when we, I think a lot of the cases we've done, the consumer cases, all the cases I've made reference to, the black lung work, where it's hard for, the organization wouldn't have anyone to assist them in these very technical fields without spending a great deal of money. </sentence><sentence id="6650">Helping them to write regulations that will benefit them. </sentence><sentence id="6651">All these things have been really a great place for me to work and for the lawyers who worked in this program. </sentence><sentence id="6652">I mean I think people who work in <span class="building">legal services</span> across the <span class="country">country</span> who devote their lives or their careers to serving the poor, are a wonderful group, I have a lot of admiration for them. </sentence><sentence id="6653">So it's always nice for me to come to <span class="building">work</span> every day, because it's such a good place to be. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6706">Q: I wondered, you mentioned that there is some racism in the <span class="region">area</span> and you also talked a little earlier about how you had a difficult time when you first arrived, because people were thinking of you all as Communists or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="6707">And you had trouble renting an <span class="building">office</span> and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="6708">Did you experience any anti-Semitism? </sentence><sentence id="6709">Did people know that you were Jewish? </sentence><sentence id="6710">Has that been a problem at all? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6716">A: I don't think so, many people in this <span class="region">area</span> don't know, really have had no experience with Jews at all, or Quakers for that matter, I think. </sentence><sentence id="6717">And so in the more recent years, I don't spend a lot of time at it, but I've been to <span class="building">church</span> groups and talked about Judaism. </sentence><sentence id="6718">Maybe the Klan, the few members of the Klan, when they get together, their constitution talks about the white, Aryan race, and Jews, money-making Jews, and that kind of thing. </sentence><sentence id="6719">I've never been conscious, really of anti-Semitism here in any major way. </sentence><sentence id="6720">I know that those, I know that people who are strong Christians do feel that if you're not saved, you're going to Hell. </sentence><sentence id="6721">And so they have a real concern about us, whom they may like and they don't want us to go to hell. </sentence><sentence id="6722">And they would like us, I'm sure, to be saved. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6730">Q: Do they try to convert you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6732">A: No, I think... Annie probably went to more <span class="building">church</span>, was, went to <span class="building">church</span> more, because she spent more weekends with friends who went to <span class="building">church</span>, some of whom are more evangelical than others. </sentence><sentence id="6733">We have been invited to many <span class="building">churches</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6734">And we have gone to, more to the <span class="building">Presbyterian 89</span> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="6735">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="6736"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 90 <span class="building">church</span> than others because, probably the Catholics and the Presbyterians have run more programs for poor people. </sentence><sentence id="6737">And in this <span class="region">area</span> over time, <span class="building">St. Vincent's Mission</span> came in here. </sentence><sentence id="6738">Or maybe not the <span class="building">Catholic church</span> as such, but the ministry. </sentence><sentence id="6739">They brought more, while they are also attempting to increase the number of Catholics in their ranks, I think their message of being socially concerned has been stronger than that of the other faiths, even though they are a minority. </sentence><sentence id="6740">The <span class="building">Presbyterian church</span> was always very active with its Christian Service ministry. </sentence><sentence id="6741">And it's not as fundamental as the <span class="building">Baptist church</span> and some of their beliefs with respect to Jesus. </sentence><sentence id="6742">So when Jean, as I said from the beginning was working with the Meals on Wheels program and a number of their related programs in this Christian Service ministry, we've gone there many times. </sentence><sentence id="6743">But there's never been any real, I mean we've known all of their ministers. </sentence><sentence id="6744">In recent years there's been a much more sharing between rabbis and ministers. </sentence><sentence id="6745">Now here, the <span class="building">Ministerial Association</span>, they had a Catholic priest that was here when we first came, named Father... oh gosh, what's his name? </sentence><sentence id="6746">Getting a little tired. </sentence><sentence id="6747">Young Catholic priest was here. </sentence><sentence id="6748">It will come to me ina moment. </sentence><sentence id="6749">And they wouldn't let him in, wouldn't let him in the <span class="building">Ministerial Association</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6750">He'd tend to wear moccasins around and wear blue jeans and was always a little bit out front on some of the social issues, working with welfare folks, and asking people about this being the way Jesus would have it. </sentence><sentence id="6751">He finally, I think, five or six years later, put a Christmas card in the paper, wishing all of his ministers well at Christmas, hoping they would have a nice Christmas. </sentence><sentence id="6752">He guilt-tripped them into it. </sentence><sentence id="6753">They finally let him in. </sentence><sentence id="6754">But there was that kind of thing, but there's never really been, I don't know, people have always been very nice to us maybe because, more about who we are than what the religion is. </sentence><sentence id="6755">I'm sure they would welcome our, many of the <span class="building">churches</span> would have welcomed the conversions. </sentence><sentence id="6756">Or the fundamental religion, especially. </sentence><sentence id="6757">We've been to many funerals, I mean, when you get to these, especially when you go to a funeral where they preach over, about salvation and that you simply, you know, you're doomed if you're not saved. </sentence><sentence id="6758">And they're looking at you. ( </sentence><sentence id="6759">Laughing.) </sentence><sentence id="6760">But they mean well. </sentence><sentence id="6761">I mean that's what it is, they feel like we're going to be lost if this doesn't happen. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6793">Q: Would you just talk a little bit about your and Jean's practice as far as faith, religion? </sentence><sentence id="6794">You go to <span class="building">synagogue</span> once a month? </sentence><sentence id="6795">You go to a <span class="building">Quaker meeting</span> once a month? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6799">A: Yeah, well we, while the kids were, we sort of maintain the Jewish tradition, Friday nights, Saturday, not every Friday night, but especially when everybody is together. </sentence><sentence id="6800">And we go to services now more regularly since we go to <span class="region">Williamson West Virginia</span>, for the Jewish services. </sentence><sentence id="6801">They are on Sunday night, as I mentioned. </sentence><sentence id="6802">It's a rabbi comes down from <span class="populated place">Huntington</span>, so he has a Friday night service on a Sunday night. </sentence><sentence id="6803">The Quakers meet monthly in somebody's <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6804">And of course you can have a Quaker meeting whether you have three people or three thousand, because they are silent meetings for worship. </sentence><sentence id="6805">And people get up and say something during the silence, if they are led to say something. </sentence><sentence id="6806">And it may go on for half an hour, it may go the whole hour and nobody says anything. </sentence><sentence id="6807">Or it maybe that someone has a comment that is on their mind and many people speak. </sentence><sentence id="6808">In the more organized <span class="populated place">communities</span> in the <span class="region">East</span>, you have this group of overseers. </sentence><sentence id="6809">I mean the meeting has to have an administration with dues and <span class="building">Sunday school</span> and all of that. </sentence><sentence id="6810">But this is a very informal group. </sentence><sentence id="6811">There is an annual meeting of Quakers in <span class="region">Kentucky</span> which we haven't been to in a while. </sentence><sentence id="6812">But the participants here are generally a couple in <span class="populated place">Hazard</span> and a woman who teaches at the <span class="building">Pine Mountain Settlement School</span> and a woman who is a doctor in <span class="populated place">Hyden</span>, who is in her seventies and has been there for maybe twenty-five or thirty years, I guess, who's a teacher. </sentence><sentence id="6813">But he was a doctor and she's a Quaker, very interesting person, 90 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="6814">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="6815"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 91 who lives up a holler in <span class="populated place">Hyden</span> in a small <span class="building">house</span> with... all these hundreds of goldfinches that are usually there. </sentence><sentence id="6816">A very nice location. </sentence><sentence id="6817">And then there have been some Mennonite volunteers, who have come to <span class="building">Quaker meeting</span> during their volunteer period. </sentence><sentence id="6818">So the group is a little bit fluid, although there is this permanent group, if you will. </sentence><sentence id="6819">The couple in <span class="populated place">Hazard</span> work for the <span class="building">rural health system</span> and they've been there for several years. </sentence><sentence id="6820">So they meet once a month and they were in <span class="populated place">Prestonsburg</span> a few weeks ago. </sentence><sentence id="6821">The next time will be in <span class="populated place">Hazard</span> or at the <span class="building">Pine Mountain Settlement School</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6822">That woman is in her seventies, also. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6849">Q: And do you always go to the <span class="building">Quaker meetings</span>, too? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6851">A: And I always go. </sentence><sentence id="6852">I'ma very big fan of Quakerism. </sentence><sentence id="6853">I mean I would not, not to convert. </sentence><sentence id="6854">It is a very tolerant religion, built on faith, and the light that shines on everyone. </sentence><sentence id="6855">And I don't know that there's a great enormous amount of difference, except that it's built on the teachings of Jesus, essentially. </sentence><sentence id="6856">But they don't dwell on salvation and the other parts of it. </sentence><sentence id="6857">I think they really dwell on living your life out in a full life and serving others, and the principles of humanity that I share and that I feel good about. </sentence><sentence id="6858">So I think it's been pretty easy for us to adapt to each other. </sentence><sentence id="6859">I've probably spent more time now with the <span class="region">Quaker part</span> of it. </sentence><sentence id="6860">I really haven't studied Quakerism that carefully. </sentence><sentence id="6861">I've read a lot of books and probably will some time, as I should read about Judaism. </sentence><sentence id="6862">And I haven't done as much of that also, a little here and a little there. </sentence><sentence id="6863">But I'd like to that a little bit more. </sentence><sentence id="6864">I've got plenty of other things I also want to read. </sentence><sentence id="6865">Right? </sentence><sentence id="6866">Like you do. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6883">Q: And how did you raise your kids? </sentence><sentence id="6884">Were they involved in both religions? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6887">A: They were involved in both, although as I said, Michael, we didn't have Quaker meetings back then. </sentence><sentence id="6888">We had some of the state gatherings. </sentence><sentence id="6889">This group is a relatively recent phenomenon of the last three or four years. </sentence><sentence id="6890">It was really sparked by the people in <span class="populated place">Hazard</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6891">And we didn't go initially. </sentence><sentence id="6892">We were when Michael, I guess in our earlier years, we pretty much went to services in <span class="populated place">Ashland</span> and took Michael when he was little, and Annie. </sentence><sentence id="6893">They were the only children their age at that time. </sentence><sentence id="6894">And we would go fairly regularly, but we always went during the Jewish holidays. </sentence><sentence id="6895">And the Quaker tradition doesn't have a lot of formal ceremony with it as Judaism does around these holidays. </sentence><sentence id="6896">So we would celebrate those and we would go to Passover. </sentence><sentence id="6897">We had Passover Seders at our <span class="building">house</span>, which Jean and maybe the others would, she did the cooking and became fairly well-versed in what's involved. </sentence><sentence id="6898">Did some reading and embarrassingly probably knows more about some of those traditions now than I do. </sentence><sentence id="6899">But that's the way the kids were raised. </sentence><sentence id="6900">And Michael, as I told you, I spent more time with Michael probably talking about, doing sort of a light Sunday school lesson every Sunday for several years. </sentence><sentence id="6901">That was part of our tradition at <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6902">I didn't do that with Ann Louise for, I'm not sure exactly why. </sentence><sentence id="6903">I think... who knows why? </sentence><sentence id="6904">But I didn't. </sentence><sentence id="6905">More recently she has become much more interested in both. </sentence><sentence id="6906">I think she was, as Jean was relating to you, very concerned about the Nazis, the history, the danger that it posed and still is worried about some goofy Klansperson coming to the <span class="building">house</span> and doing something. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6927">Q: To you in particular? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6929">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="6930">She has become, both of the kids will be <span class="building">home</span> for the Jewish holidays, I think. </sentence><sentence id="6931">I don't know about Annie, for sure, because she works on Saturdays. </sentence><sentence id="6932">But neither of them... and 91 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="6933">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="6934"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 92 Michael will be <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6935">Rosh Hashanah falls on a weekend. </sentence><sentence id="6936">I don't know if he will come on Yom Kippur. </sentence><sentence id="6937">Now someone would say, "How could you work on Yom Kippur?" </sentence><sentence id="6938">And he might or might not. </sentence><sentence id="6939">But those are their <span class="dlf">lines</span> to draw. </sentence><sentence id="6940">I mean it would have been unthinkable for anybody to work on Rosh Hashanah or Yom Kippur when I was growing up. </sentence><sentence id="6941">And so they still have to find their own, figure out, I guess, what they want to do in terms of their religious... or how religious they're going to be. </sentence><sentence id="6942">Either way, either way, I think though Annie's now becoming a little more interested. </sentence><sentence id="6943">Although she hasn't been going to the <span class="building">synagogue</span> in <span class="populated place">Louisville</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6944">She and I went to a <span class="building">Unitarian service</span> together in <span class="populated place">Lexington</span> a couple of years ago. </sentence><sentence id="6945">But we feel okay about it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6965">Q: Do you want to say something in closing now? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6967">A: Like a prayer? ( </sentence><sentence id="6968">Laughing.) </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6971">Q: Would you lead us in a prayer? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6973">A: No, I can't imagine anybody listening to all these tapes. </sentence><sentence id="6974">I was saying to Jean, "Maybe..." She said, "Well, can I listen to them?" </sentence><sentence id="6975">And I said, "Well, you wouldn't want to listen to all this." </sentence><sentence id="6976">I said, "Well, maybe somebody wants to listen to this history years from now or maybe the kids would want to look in some archive, right?" </sentence><sentence id="6977">No, it was nice of you to be interested to do it, to listen to it. </sentence><sentence id="6978">And I'm sure we still haven't covered a lot of <span class="env feature">ground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6979">But it would be true if I did one of you, even though you probably wouldn't think so, but we all could spend a lot of time. </sentence><sentence id="6980">I've just been fortunate, probably to have had such an interesting career in these two legal jobs, with the <span class="building">Division</span> and with legal services. </sentence><sentence id="6981">And now that I'm also interested in the <span class="building">Science Center</span> and other community activities that we've been involved in. </sentence><sentence id="6982">Just have a lot of interests that I'd like to pursue, that happen to be, I think, in <span class="region">areas</span> that can affect other people and help them in a positive way, besides me. </sentence><sentence id="6983">And I like to do it, so I think that's been a real reward. </sentence><sentence id="6984">And you can come back in thirty years, and maybe when I hit a hundred, I'll reflect on the last forty. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6997">Q: Yeah, that's a good idea. </sentence><sentence id="6998">Okay, I'll see you in thirty years. </sentence><sentence id="6999">Well, thank you. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7022">A: Well, I mean my role was, at the time was as Chief of the Criminal Section of the <span class="building">Civil Rights Division</span>. </sentence><sentence id="7023">Because this involved the National Guard and potentially other police officials, state officials, the <span class="building">Justice Department</span> is called in to investigate. </sentence><sentence id="7024">Potentially there is a federal crime when police officials act illegally or summarily and what we call summary punishment by not arresting, for example, students who do something wrong, but rather they overreact and shoot or punish or beat whoever the victim might be. </sentence><sentence id="7025">So, when this happened, this incident happened and was called to our attention, my job was to write a request to the Federal Bureau of Investigation to investigate, to see whether a violation of federal law had occurred. </sentence><sentence id="7026">And so, that being May of--how many years ago?--1970, thirty years ago, I drafted that request, which then was sent out under the name of the Assistant Attorney General of the <span class="building">Civil Rights Division</span>, who I believe at the time was Jerry Leonard. </sentence><sentence id="7027">And I'm sure I'd have to go dig it out or I don't even know if I have a copy of it, you know, it would be fairly thorough about where they would be interviewing any witnesses who were there and whether they, the police officials in fact were threatened or there was any reason that would justify their having used force in shooting those students who were killed. </sentence><sentence id="7028">There was a long <span class="building">grand jury</span> convened after I left. </sentence><sentence id="7029">As I recall it was actually inconclusive. </sentence><sentence id="7030">I think there was no federal trial. </sentence><sentence id="7031">I think there were civil trials later which I'm not sure, it seemed to me they may have recovered some damages for the families of the children, of the students who had been killed. </sentence><sentence id="7032">It was just a very tragic event. </sentence><sentence id="7033">There were others at the time. </sentence><sentence id="7034">I recall, I think when we were speaking, I had seen an article recently before I gave the commencement address here at <span class="building">Prestonsburg Community College</span>, which happened to have been written by the President of <span class="building">Kent State University</span>. </sentence><sentence id="7035">It was sort of a memorial column or just recalling those tragic events and the fact that they were in the memory of the President and people who were at <span class="populated place">Kent State</span> now. </sentence><sentence id="7036">And that the <span class="building">school</span> itself had made great progress in the intervening years and that this awful event was a milestone, obviously, in the history of the <span class="building">school</span>, which sort of marred its reputation, along with... or which they felt marred its reputation. </sentence><sentence id="7037">It was not forgotten, but that since then the <span class="building">school</span> had progressed and had moved into the age of technology and that she was very proud of their progress. </sentence><sentence id="7038">And I happened to be particularly moved by the way that she ended the <span class="spatial object">column</span>, which was that in this age of technology, it was important not to lose our humanity. </sentence><sentence id="7039">And so I was, used her, some of her quotations in concluding this address that I gave to the local students. </sentence><sentence id="7040">And it reminded me that it was also sort of one of the last things we did, that I did at the <span class="building">Justice Department</span>, before we left on our vacation, but really left. </sentence><sentence id="7041">And then were headed for <span class="region">Appalachia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="7042">93 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="7043">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="7044"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 94 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7068">Q: So you just filed the case, but you didn't investigate it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7070">A: Well, I didn't, no. </sentence><sentence id="7071">My job basically, if... had I stayed, the <span class="building">office</span>, the lawyers who worked with me and for me as Chief of the Criminal Section... after, the way those things would work is that when the FBI goes through its investigation and prepares a report, those are usually turned over to the United States Attorney for prosecution or for determination of whether a crime has been committed. </sentence><sentence id="7072">And generally then if there is some conflict, in other words when the officers say, "I thought that it looked like the student had a gun and that we had to shoot the student or we would have been killed," those factual disputes, someone has to resolve them by generally going to a <span class="building">grand jury</span>, which is what happened. </sentence><sentence id="7073">And then either the U.S. Attorney co-operatively with lawyers from the <span class="building">Civil Rights Division</span>, or... would make that presentation, but we left. </sentence><sentence id="7074">That was at the point after I had authored and drafted this report, this request, was when we left. </sentence><sentence id="7075">And so the investigation really went on and I believe one of my colleagues, Jim Turner, who was sort of one notch up in the hierarchy as a Deputy Attorney General(r), was sent out there and that he spent several months, along with reviewing the reports and working with the grand jury and then determining whether someone should be indicted or not. </sentence><sentence id="7076">I want to think that there was never, that there were no federal indictments, but I may be wrong. </sentence><sentence id="7077">It seems to me that was one of the sad things, that this was one of those, one of those sort of inconclusive... there were, on the face of it you would think that there was no reason to shoot students, because they were certainly not armed. </sentence><sentence id="7078">And that they got caught in the, were victims of what happened. </sentence><sentence id="7079">But I'm not sure that anyone was actually ever accused of having, of criminally having done this. </sentence><sentence id="7080">That there was some evidence in the heat of the moment that these folks felt threatened, their lives were threatened. </sentence><sentence id="7081">And that they, while they may have been negligent or they may have, whatever they did, that there was enough justification to make them question, that they made a bad decision, but it wasn't, certainly wasn't intentional on their part. </sentence><sentence id="7082">And that it may have been enough to warrant civil proceedings. </sentence><sentence id="7083">But that's the way those things always, you know, went. </sentence><sentence id="7084">And so in other circumstances, like when I was in the <span class="populated place">Houston</span> case, we also asked the FBI to investigate and to assist us in determining, looking at records and other <span class="region">areas</span>. </sentence><sentence id="7085">And then the lawyer who is responsible for the case, as I was in the <span class="populated place">Houston</span> case with other lawyers working with me and were working under my direction, then I would present the case to the judge. </sentence><sentence id="7086">That's how those things work. </sentence><sentence id="7087">We're done. </sentence><sentence id="7088">I didn't do any more in <span class="populated place">Kent State</span>. </sentence><sentence id="7089">I mean that was, most of that then happened after I left. </sentence><sentence id="7090">So it was a memory and this article that I happened to see in the <span class="building">newspaper</span> sort of jogged my mind back. </sentence><sentence id="7091">It's sort of the punctuation mark. </sentence><sentence id="7092">It's the point at which we left. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7116">Q: I wonder also if you had, at the time if you felt, you had mentioned in the earlier sessions of this interview how much you idealized this <span class="country">country</span> and its constitution and the principles on which it was founded, and that you really held, had high expectations of it. </sentence><sentence id="7117">During the Vietnam War did you feel disillusioned with this <span class="country">country</span> and its government? </sentence><sentence id="7118">Or did that change your perspective at all? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7122">A: Well, I mean, I think there are lots of times when you wish political decisions were made, were different. </sentence><sentence id="7123">I mean I think that everyone is, that a lot of people are sad about our involvement in the Vietnam War. </sentence><sentence id="7124">I was in the war, served during the time of <span class="country">Korea</span>. </sentence><sentence id="7125">It was obviously... and as I probably said before, there were lots of reasons I enjoyed the time I spent in the Service. </sentence><sentence id="7126">We  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 95 made a lot of very close friends, who I continue to see and hear from, and get together with periodically. </sentence><sentence id="7127">And I think you feel that you are doing something worthwhile when you're in the Service. </sentence><sentence id="7128">And helping this <span class="country">country</span> in a small way. </sentence><sentence id="7129">But that I also noted that when, during the <span class="dlf">Suez Canal</span> Crisis, when we were on alert for a week and no one was quite certain which <span class="region">side</span> we were on, and that because the <span class="country">United States</span> hadn't made up its mind which <span class="region">side</span> we were on, and <span class="country">Israel</span> was one of the partners, was one of the main parties involved in that dispute, the thought that we would be in a conflict with <span class="country">Israel</span> was not very appealing to me, but that it just let me know how much of a, that this was not what I wanted to do (laughing), to be regimented in that way. </sentence><sentence id="7130">So that staying in the Service was not anything that I wanted to do. </sentence><sentence id="7131">On the other hand, I always, I think that it's a very dangerous occupation. </sentence><sentence id="7132">And I feel those people who are in the Military for a career, who really believe that this is an important thing to do, often that we owe a lot to people who have been, who have served in our Military, and who have either given their lives or come back wounded or who are veterans. </sentence><sentence id="7133">And I'm sure now we much, recognize much more the people in <span class="country">Vietnam</span>, who may not have won a war, were nevertheless there because they were doing what they were told to do. </sentence><sentence id="7134">And of course a lot of people were willing, were Conscientious Objectors and didn't go. </sentence><sentence id="7135">My personal feeling is if someone's a Conscientious Objector they ought not to go. </sentence><sentence id="7136">And we ought to let them not go. </sentence><sentence id="7137">There are plenty of people who want to go or who were willing to go or there were and there were things that could be done. </sentence><sentence id="7138">So, I don't know that I, I'm not disillusioned. </sentence><sentence id="7139">I'm still very much a, feel very strongly that, I guess maybe it's a little rhetoric, but I feel that this is still the best <span class="country">country</span> in many, many ways in the world. </sentence><sentence id="7140">There are a lot of imperfections with it, that we... and some of the issues that we have to resolve are very difficult issues. </sentence><sentence id="7141">When we see in this <span class="region">area</span> the economy being as poor as it is. </sentence><sentence id="7142">We've lost a lot of jobs here. </sentence><sentence id="7143">Trying to catch up. </sentence><sentence id="7144">What I spoke about at <span class="building">PCC</span>, of course, that, that the <span class="populated place">Kent State</span> thing related to, I asked, I emphasized to the students how much they should be grateful for being in this free <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="7145">It was also the, the week of the graduation was also the week of Law Day, in which we celebrate our freedom and the Constitution under which we live. </sentence><sentence id="7146">And it was also the anniversary of Holocaust Remembrance Day. </sentence><sentence id="7147">And it was the anniversary, the thirty year anniversary of <span class="populated place">Kent State</span>. </sentence><sentence id="7148">And I think all of those are messages that we need to remember and reflect upon. </sentence><sentence id="7149">I think we do have a legal system that really is the basis for the freedom that we have. </sentence><sentence id="7150">And a lot of those freedoms are at times tenuous. </sentence><sentence id="7151">You worry when the Klan, you wish we did not have the Klan around, but the fact that we allow them to exist under, in a restricted way still is part of the freedom that we can enjoy. </sentence><sentence id="7152">And I think all of those kinds of issues sort of tumble around together. </sentence><sentence id="7153">And yet we, we have to be, we're always balancing those things. </sentence><sentence id="7154">And I think the political system that we're under, where we flip back and forth between a Democratic party in control and the Republican party in control at the state and national government, kind of keeps everybody off balance, at the state level and the <span class="dlf">federal level</span>. </sentence><sentence id="7155">But it seems to make us sort of come out in the <span class="region">middle</span> and even though lots of things go on that we don't like. </sentence><sentence id="7156">I mean I wish we had greater funding for legal services at the state and <span class="region">federal level</span>. </sentence><sentence id="7157">And sometimes <span class="building">Congress</span>, the legislation we have on, that affects welfare moms seems very punitive, at times. </sentence><sentence id="7158">And I know we could do better with that. </sentence><sentence id="7159">We clearly need a better health care system, there are lots of places where we can improve, where we ought to improve, being as rich as this <span class="country">country</span> is. </sentence><sentence id="7160">We seem not to regard people, the problems poor people have as seriously as we ought to. </sentence><sentence id="7161">Well, that's a rambling answer. </sentence><sentence id="7162">I can't even remember, it seemed to me that we started with <span class="populated place">Kent State</span> and we kind of got into what I was talking about, but it all kind of goes together.95 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7211">Q: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="7212">Kind of related to what you were saying, can you talk more, you had mentioned that sometimes, you mentioned off tape and I'd like to get this on tape, that you mentioned when you go to speak at various places within the <span class="populated place">community</span>, people are interested in, partially interested in hearing you speak because of your Holocaust-related experiences. </sentence><sentence id="7213">And maybe you can talk about your, your invitation to speak at the hundred-year anniversary of one of the <span class="building">black churches</span> here and also talk about why you think it is that people want to hear about that particular aspect. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7217">A: Well, I think that the <span class="building">black church</span>, the name right now escapes me, probably shouldn't. </sentence><sentence id="7218">The hundredth anniversary was an event they'd worked on, was quite a significant event for the <span class="building">church</span>. </sentence><sentence id="7219">There are two <span class="building">churches</span> in <span class="populated place">Wheelwright</span>, <span class="region">Kentucky</span> and this is one of them. </sentence><sentence id="7220">And they had been planning this anniversary for some time and have had a series of ministers over the years and it's a very cohesive <span class="populated place">community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="7221">And I think, probably, one of the reasons they asked me to speak was because they related, they knew that I was Jewish and that I had been involved as a legal services lawyer and perhaps as a <span class="building">Justice Department</span> lawyer in some civil rights issues over time. </sentence><sentence id="7222">But also that I was a, that my family had escaped from the Holocaust and they knew some of that history. </sentence><sentence id="7223">And I think they analogized it in their own way to the discrimination that they had felt and that they wanted me maybe to reflect upon the f act that there were people who were white and who were discriminated against because they were Jewish or for reasons other than race. </sentence><sentence id="7224">But that someone, a family lived in this <span class="populated place">community</span> that had shared some of that history that their own families and ancestors had experienced over their lifetime. </sentence><sentence id="7225">I know that, I think in the <span class="building">schools</span>, I think that the <span class="building">schools</span> now have made the Holocaust a very much a part of their curriculum. </sentence><sentence id="7226">When I go, I've spoken to <span class="building">middle school</span> students and <span class="building">elementary school</span> and <span class="building">high school</span> students. </sentence><sentence id="7227">And when I ask how many of them know who Ann Frank was or whether they have done a <span class="spatial object">unit</span> on Ann Frank, almost every hand goes up in the <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="7228">I think that <span class="building">unit</span> is probably done in the fifth and sixth grade and in the seventh grade. </sentence><sentence id="7229">And that, but the fact, I think teachers tell me, the fact that they see someone who is alive and who can come into their <span class="building">class</span> and say this is what happened to my family. </sentence><sentence id="7230">I was eight years old when they arrested my father and took him to the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="7231">Or I was standing in the <span class="interior space">courtyard</span> when they were dynamiting the <span class="building">synagogue</span>. </sentence><sentence id="7232">That is always more, it makes a stronger point than having heard it from a third person. </sentence><sentence id="7233">And if it's someone in their own <span class="populated place">community</span> that I suppose has been identified as having some credibility, that doesn't just make these stories up. </sentence><sentence id="7234">I think when you, you always tend to put some faith and trust in people that have lived with you a long time, who are part of the community. </sentence><sentence id="7235">It's kind of like any other, listening to older, someone described the history of the <span class="building">May house</span> or the May family or their own family history. </sentence><sentence id="7236">When they've grown up here it means more. </sentence><sentence id="7237">At least I think that's, whenever you find someone, whether it's the war, my neighbor used to, my neighbor must have been on every <span class="env feature">beach</span>. </sentence><sentence id="7238">He died a few years ago, but he was one of those Appalachian soldiers who was drafted and lived through every <span class="dlf">beach</span> assault in the <span class="env feature">Pacific</span>. </sentence><sentence id="7239">And even if he tells it in a low key sort of conversational way, it's very powerful to talk to someone who lived it. </sentence></p></dialogue>

I mean some of the church groups, when we first came Jean was... we were involved with the <span class="building">Presbyterian church</span> a good bit because they did a lot of social, were more involved in local social projects. </sentence><sentence id="7279">They started <span class="building">Meals on Wheels</span> and <span class="building">Christian Service Ministry</span> that she was involved with. </sentence><sentence id="7280">And so the ministers who knew that we were involved, had Passovers and that I was Jewish and some of that developed into, people, by word of mouth realized that I wasn't born in this <span class="country">country</span> and that I did have this experience. </sentence><sentence id="7281">But it wasn't, I guess in more recent years, I've had more, probably as people learned and as I spoke more about the Holocaust and about being Jewish, that there have been more, there's been a bit more of an awareness about the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="7282">I think partly because of the <span class="building">Holocaust Memorial</span> and there's been more publicity generally about the importance of this whole era and trying to make people remember it and not let it be forgotten. </sentence><sentence id="7283">That all probably is part of the reason why this has come up. </sentence><sentence id="7284">And I think that tying it into Law Day is something that has gotten around among the teachers, that that's something I'm willing to speak about or can speak about on Law Day, that may be more meaningful to students than just talking about the Constitution or how the legal system works, which is the other thing that we generally do when we go to the <span class="building">schools</span>. </sentence><sentence id="7285">Well, I don't have any doubt that the history, that our fleeing from <span class="country">Germany</span> and coming to this <span class="country">country</span> and being grateful for the opportunity to be free here, has sort of moved me into public service work. </sentence><sentence id="7286">I think that's pretty clear. </sentence><sentence id="7287">When I was in the military, I think it probably in a way helped move me to go to the Service as well. </sentence><sentence id="7288">I don't know that I went into the <span class="building">ROTC</span>, which helped partly also with tuition. </sentence><sentence id="7289">Back then it was one of the ways of making <span class="building">Duke</span> affordable, which was an expensive <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="7290">But I mean, whether it's just the rationalization or the reason, | think I certainly felt that being in the Service was one way of trying to help fulfill my, help me give something back. </sentence><sentence id="7291">You can stay out of the Service. </sentence><sentence id="7292">I'm sure I didn't have to do that. </sentence><sentence id="7293">But that was during a time that people also were being drafted. </sentence><sentence id="7294">And that if you didn't want to be an enlisted man and wanted to do more with your career in the Service...

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7367">Q: All right, this is tape eight, side B. And uh, related to your work or to your experiences with speaking to groups, you had mentioned a little bit earlier that you have on Law Day talked about the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="7368">And what do you talk about when you talk about the Holocaust on Law Day? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7371">A: Well, I talk about the contrast between a society that we have in this <span class="country">country</span>, where we have a government and a <span class="country">nation</span>, which is governed by the rule of law and what happened in <span class="country">Fascist Germany</span> where the legal system was basically put aside for a dictatorship. </sentence><sentence id="7372">And that the kinds of things that were able to happen in the Holocaust, which was a result of Hitler's fanaticism. </sentence><sentence id="7373">And what did happen in that dictatorship, and how, again, grateful we need to be and how they, students, can reflect on or ought to reflect, and their teachers and all of this ought to reflect on the system we have in this <span class="country">country</span>, which would not, hopefully, permit anything like that to happen. </sentence><sentence id="7374">That the checks and balances in the legislative, executive and judicial systems would keep that from happening. </sentence><sentence id="7375">And that we have, that free speech is important and that all of the guarantees that we have under the Constitution and under the Bill of Rights are very meaningful and that it's important to talk about them. </sentence><sentence id="7376">So I use, I guess the family's personal experiences, and I talk a little bit about the history of how all this came about in the 1930s from Hitler's rise to power. </sentence><sentence id="7377">How during the war, I mean even afterwards, how people would like to pretend in <span class="country">Germany</span> that no one knew about it and this all sort of just happened and people are looking the other way. </sentence><sentence id="7378">At least were looking the other way and most, I suspect, did know about what was going on in the <span class="populated place">Death camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="7379">That's what I try to focus on and I think the teachers seem to appreciate that and seem to feel that it's a good way to have their students appreciate Law Day. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7389">Q: Why don't you just talk about... you had mentioned in the first sessions that we did, something about the relationship between Judaism and justice, and it was something that you said that you had thought about. </sentence><sentence id="7390">Would you elaborate on that some? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7393">A: Well, I don't remember what I said at the time, but the important tenet, I guess, of Judaism is the emphasis on justice, study and justice. </sentence><sentence id="7394">That the Ten Commandments and having a society where being just to each other and where you have a governing, legal codes that govern Judaism, which are principles of living really. </sentence><sentence id="7395">The major ones. </sentence><sentence id="7396">I might have said that those principles probably helped to influence me and the work that Ido. </sentence><sentence id="7397">I remember when we were just talking about Law Day, usually when I begin a talk, I talk a little bit about the fact that we've been, who we are and who I am, that I'm here in <span class="populated place">Prestonsburg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="7398">We've lived in <span class="populated place">Floyd County</span> all these years. </sentence><sentence id="7399">And talk a little about our <span class="building">legal services agency</span> and try to describe that we do have a system in this <span class="country">country</span> that provides lawyers for people who can't afford lawyers, on the criminal and on the <span class="region">civil side</span>. </sentence><sentence id="7400">And that what this program, what Appalred and other civil legal services programs do and how difficult it is. </sentence><sentence id="7401">Many times it is basically impossible to navigate through the legal system without having a lawyer to help you, so that poor people are often on the short end of business transactions and many other people lose rights. </sentence><sentence id="7402">They lose benefits to which they are entitled. </sentence><sentence id="7403">And the kind of work that defenses in eviction cases, consumer cases, all the work that we have done. </sentence><sentence id="7404">The <span class="region">Broad Form</span>, environmental work. </sentence><sentence id="7405">So I try to also mention that. </sentence><sentence id="7406">So, going back to what you were asking me, I don't know that it's any easier... I mean I think all religions, whether it's Christianity with Jesus" sort of different, somewhat little different spin on the loving aspect of God, that it's not as much of the retribution and thunder that you read about in the <span class="building">Old 99</span> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="7407">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="7408"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 100 Testament. </sentence><sentence id="7409">But that any, I know there are a lot of people in legal services and folks have written about, who, even who have had backgrounds in <span class="building">Divinity School</span>, or who feel that by helping, by using their legal talents to help people who are oppressed or who are poor or have been discriminated in one way or another, that that is a good way for them to live out their life and their principles and their values. </sentence><sentence id="7410">And providing legal services for low income people, I don't think that that's... there's anything particularly unique about being Jewish in that way. </sentence><sentence id="7411">I just, probably anyone who feels that their, that religion and a belief in God is part of their personality or their person, would feel the same way about that, I think. </sentence><sentence id="7412">I mean, we have people in <span class="building">legal services</span> who are very religious. </sentence><sentence id="7413">They're Catholic, Protestant, Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="7414">And we have many people who are not religious, just as, I'm sure, other professions do. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7439">Q: The question that had come to my mind before, that had slipped out, was kind of related to something that, when I've interviewed other Holocaust survivors, that gets brought up a lot. </sentence><sentence id="7440">And I don't know whether you" ll have anything to say to it or not. </sentence><sentence id="7441">But often I hear people say that they feel, hear people state an opinion about whether a Holocaust could happen again. </sentence><sentence id="7442">And many people say, "I think this is going to happen again." </sentence><sentence id="7443">That there is going to be some kind of mass persecution of the Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="7444">And some people feel like that's not going to happen, but a lot of... it just comes up, and I'm wondering whether you feel like... you were talking a little bit earlier about the legal system in this <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="7445">Do you feel like that system is really stable enough so that there is not potential for that kind of disruption or do you feel like it is possible for something like that to happen in this <span class="country">country</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7782">Q: This is tape nine, side A. Will you, will you just repeat what you had started to say? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7784">A: Well, I was just saying in that particular situation I always can picture, we had the clothing put away in <span class="spatial object">boxes</span> behind the <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="7785">But it was really... the stench of those clothing was so strong, that it was always there. </sentence><sentence id="7786">And for some reason that always stuck with me more than the dental records. </sentence><sentence id="7787">Well, you do, you feel very badly for the families, you feel kind of not very forgiving, I think, for the people who did this. </sentence><sentence id="7788">And of course, there were some <span class="building">church</span> burnings before that. </sentence><sentence id="7789">The atmosphere around, in <span class="region">Mississippi</span> and <span class="populated place">Neshoba County</span> among the, in the <span class="populated place">white community</span> and among the Klan, that particular group of Klansmen, Sam Bowers", the mastermind of this one, who also was behind the firebombing of another African-American, who was a voting rights leader in <span class="populated place">Hattiesburg</span>, <span class="region">Mississippi</span>. </sentence><sentence id="7790">Vernon Dahmer, who, they firebombed his <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="7791">These people were just pretty evil. </sentence><sentence id="7792">They were violent, and just bad people in that sense. </sentence><sentence id="7793">So I think you have a, if anything you're probably driven. </sentence><sentence id="7794">I don't know that I ever felt depressed, I think most of us, and at the time this was a pretty highly motivated group of lawyers, who worked in the <span class="building">Civil Rights Division</span>. </sentence><sentence id="7795">It was a very relatively small group of lawyers in the early "60s. </sentence><sentence id="7796">It was sort of a sidelight, but I mean <span class="building">Congress</span>'s commitment to civil rights was not great either. </sentence><sentence id="7797">The <span class="populated place">Division</span> had very few lawyers working on civil rights cases when I started in 1962. </sentence><sentence id="7798">And they had to beg for any money, and so there were very few of us and we worked on these voting rights cases, it took an enormous amount of time and it was hard to do more than two or three of them. </sentence><sentence id="7799">We'd spend months looking at records and microfilm. </sentence><sentence id="7800">And we worked extraordinary long hours. </sentence><sentence id="7801">He couldn't understand why people who were family men with children would want to go <span class="building">home</span> at the end of the day and not come back and work at night or work on Saturdays or work on Sundays. </sentence><sentence id="7802">Of course, there were some folks who got divorces over that hard work, just as they do in the Service, I think. </sentence><sentence id="7803">So I don't know, I think that lawyers get depressed when they lose cases. </sentence><sentence id="7804">And we lost, we lost many cases in the early stages in the <span class="building">lower courts</span>, voting rights cases and others, because the judges themselves were segregationists and were appointed and came out of that society. </sentence><sentence id="7805">So we had to appeal their decisions before and they were reversed and all of that took time. </sentence><sentence id="7806">So, when you work hard, it doesn't matter what, if you work hard... then when we knew we were going to lose, it's... and then you did lose, you're sort of prepared for it. </sentence><sentence id="7807">And you really are trying to put the case together in the first <span class="interior space">level</span>, so that it's a compelling case to the next <span class="interior space">level</span>. </sentence><sentence id="7808">And that's what happened, we overprepared and we generally won, eventually we would win. </sentence><sentence id="7809">And then gradually the law started to change. </sentence><sentence id="7810">It took a very long time, and so I've said many times it was fortunate or maybe because of that slow pace and the limited role of the federal government, that somebody like Martin Luther King had to come along. </sentence><sentence id="7811">Or that blacks had to organize themselves and realize, as so often happens, that people have to organize and that movements get started and that direct action has a place. </sentence><sentence id="7812">And it all sort of came together in this instance around the Voting Rights Act of 1965. </sentence><sentence id="7813">That's when Jean and I met. </sentence><sentence id="7814">We were in <span class="populated place">Selma</span>, we were in this case, this voting rights case, this <span class="populated place">Dallas County</span> case was a case, the first voting rights case under the 1965 Voting Rights Act, that election. </sentence><sentence id="7815">I think we may

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7854">A: I don't, not really, I think. </sentence><sentence id="7855">There was a very good, made for T.V. movie about that case. </sentence><sentence id="7856">I'm often asked about "Mississippi Burning," which is a popular movie that came out, which was not really accurate in many ways. </sentence><sentence id="7857">But I thought it depicted the hatred of the atmosphere at the time fairly well, and some parts of it were there. </sentence><sentence id="7858">Jean and I have a, at our <span class="building">house</span>, the painting of the <span class="spatial object">sailboat</span> in our <span class="interior space">living room</span> is from the <span class="building">restaurant</span> called, it was from <span class="populated place">Meridian</span>, called <span class="building">Wideman's Restaurant</span>, which was where we worked out of the <span class="building">Meridian office</span>, which is close to <span class="region">Neshoba County</span>. </sentence><sentence id="7859">But I don't think so. </sentence><sentence id="7860">I mean, one of the other last things beside the <span class="populated place">Kent State</span> thing that I did at the <span class="building">Civil Rights Division</span> was to, you know after these folks were convicted, then they appealed their conviction and it went on. </sentence><sentence id="7861">That took a few years. </sentence><sentence id="7862">And I think one of the other last things that I did was to file a brief opposing their last motion not to be sent off to <span class="building">prison</span>. </sentence><sentence id="7863">I wrote the response to that and then they were picked up. </sentence><sentence id="7864">Then they finally went to <span class="building">jail</span>. </sentence><sentence id="7865">So that was about 1970. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7878">Q: Do people ask you to speak about your civil rights era experiences very often? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7880">A: Not, it only comes, it comes up, well, my friend Ned Pillersdorf, who is a practicing lawyer here, teaches a class on the <span class="building">court system</span>, on I think, civil liberties and the law. </sentence><sentence id="7881">And he generally has speakers come in, other judges and I usually come in for a night with him. </sentence><sentence id="7882">And I've spoken a few other times, but really not very much. </sentence><sentence id="7883">And I'm not sure that that many people are aware of what I did. </sentence><sentence id="7884">I mean I don't particularly publicize it. </sentence><sentence id="7885">If I'm giving a speech and somebody's writing some background about my legal history, they'll generally mention that. </sentence><sentence id="7886">But I don't really do much speaking about it. </sentence><sentence id="7887">Usually the <span class="building">schools</span> have a <span class="spatial object">unit</span> on it. </sentence><sentence id="7888">There's a lot of, certainly a lot of written materials and most of those... Taylor Branch's books quote my boss, there's a lot in Taylor's books about John Doar(tm). </sentence><sentence id="7889">And usually when books are written like that, that's who they are going to write about. </sentence><sentence id="7890">I don't know that I'm anybody necessarily. </sentence><sentence id="7891">But locally if people ask, I will talk about the cases. </sentence><sentence id="7892">I mean I've spoken a few times, not recently about the legal developments of these, of how we put these cases together and the Voting Rights Act and the impact of the Voting Rights Act. </sentence><sentence id="7893">But then I left in 1970 and I've been doing this legal services work for thirty years. </sentence><sentence id="7894">And unless those things come together somewhere, it's become part of my, sort of distant past, except for reunions of Civil Rights Division lawyers and some of the ongoing contacts I've had with people. </sentence><sentence id="7895">So not really very much. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7924">A: Well, I think probably what I had reference to was after Richard Nixon was elected and William Mitchell became Attorney General(r), they did not want to continue to seek bussing of students as a remedy to undo segregation. </sentence><sentence id="7925">And bussing, <span class="populated place">Charlotte</span> had accepted a bussing remedy and several other <span class="region">states</span>, too. </sentence><sentence id="7926">The problem is when you have a segregated <span class="populated place">community</span>, so that white students, black students are, if you don't use something like bussing, you can't achieve very much integration, unless you pair up <span class="building">schools</span> where the two <span class="populated place">housing districts</span> happen to be close. </sentence><sentence id="7927">Where they call that pairing of <span class="building">schools</span>. </sentence><sentence id="7928">You could pair <span class="building">schools</span> that are in nearby <span class="populated place">neighborhoods</span>. </sentence><sentence id="7929">But the Nixon administration, so the Nixon administration really backed, not only on bussing, but they generally felt, I think, that the position of the Department in the past had been too strong towards moving towards integrating <span class="building">classrooms</span>. </sentence><sentence id="7930">And they were more inclined towards free choice, which would essentially leave student... the <span class="building">schools</span> white and black, with some very few exceptions. </sentence><sentence id="7931">And the <span class="populated place">Houston</span> case was filed right after the Nixons came in and we did ask for bussing as a remedy. </sentence><sentence id="7932">And it was the last case that they allowed that to go through. </sentence><sentence id="7933">In fact, the Assistant Attorney General, who was probably called on the carpet about it a little bit, because it had gone to him and he had approved it. </sentence><sentence id="7934">And I don't know that he was brand new, whether he really focused on it as much as he might have. </sentence><sentence id="7935">But the Attorney General had to, I think had to sign it as well. </sentence><sentence id="7936">We went forward in that case. </sentence><sentence id="7937">It was a very large case. </sentence><sentence id="7938"><span class="populated place">Houston</span> was the third-largest <span class="building">school district</span> in the <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="7939">I can't remember, a couple of hundred <span class="building">schools</span>. </sentence><sentence id="7940">They had, what they had done is spent millions and millions of dollars building new <span class="building">suburban schools</span> outside, on the outer fringes of <span class="populated place">Houston</span>. </sentence><sentence id="7941">At the same time they let the <span class="building">inner-city schools</span> decay, so it was really doubly bad. </sentence><sentence id="7942">It wasn't just, in some <span class="populated place">school districts</span> they tried to upgrade <span class="building">black schools</span> to prevent desegregation. </sentence><sentence id="7943">In <span class="populated place">Houston</span> they didn't care. </sentence><sentence id="7944">They spent all their money on <span class="building">white schools</span> and let the <span class="building">black schools</span> get worse. </sentence><sentence id="7945">So, but then at the same time they bussed white kids past <span class="building">black schools</span> and blacks past <span class="building">white schools</span>. </sentence><sentence id="7946">So we asked for, I had an expert from <span class="populated place">Miami</span>, <span class="region">Florida</span>, who was an expert in <span class="building">school</span> desegregation matters. </sentence><sentence id="7947">What a minute, maybe he was from <span class="populated place">Austin</span>, <span class="region">Texas</span>. </sentence><sentence id="7948">Mike Stolee. </sentence><sentence id="7949">I guess he was from <span class="populated place">Austin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="7950">Well, one or the other. </sentence><sentence id="7951">And he testified as to the need to <span class="spatial object">bus</span> and that using bussing as a remedy would produce a, basically an integrated <span class="building">school system</span>, with all the advantages that might come, or that could come with that. </sentence><sentence id="7952">There was much more to it in the case than that, but basically that was it. </sentence><sentence id="7953">The other phenomenon at the time was that the <span class="populated place">Chicano community</span> was just developing, so that it was like we had three donuts. </sentence><sentence id="7954">You had a core of inner-city <span class="building">black schools</span>, then you had a small, growing donut around it of <span class="populated place">Chicano communities</span> and then you had all the whites on the outside. </sentence><sentence id="7955">But racially, Chicanos were treated as whites at that time, and probably still are. </sentence><sentence id="7956">There's a designation for themselves, but we were trying to desegregate a <span class="populated place">school district</span> that had traditionally been black and white. </sentence><sentence id="7957">And so one of the things that the judge in the case did, was pair up some <span class="building">white schools</span> with <span class="building">Chicano schools</span>, which I wasn't particularly happy about. </sentence><sentence id="7958">I mean I don't know that we had achieved very much, as we had hoped to do. </sentence><sentence id="7959">There were some other things. </sentence><sentence id="7960">We didn't get a lot of bussing, but we got, the Board was required to spend massive amounts of money to get, to upgrade <span class="building">schools</span>. </sentence><sentence id="7961">And the other, probably the best thing that happened was they threw out the <span class="building">School Board</span>. </sentence><sentence id="7962">They voted in a new <span class="building">School Board</span> that was much more moderate. </sentence><sentence id="7963">And they got rid of the lawyer who had gotten rich representing the Board and keeping the system segregated. </sentence><sentence id="7964">This case that I was working on had been filed many years before that and the NAACP had sort of reactivated it and urged the government to enter the case, which we did. </sentence><sentence id="7965">And so when we moved down there with four or five lawyers, and Jean came  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 108 with me, we had not been married too long and we rented an <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, we lived there four or five months getting ready for this trial. </sentence><sentence id="7966">And when it was over, we took a big trip and nine months later our son Michael was born. </sentence><sentence id="7967">Actually we went to <span class="country">Canada</span>, up to <span class="populated place">Calgary</span> and... you ever been up there? </sentence><sentence id="7968"><span class="populated place">Lake Louise</span>, <span class="populated place">Banff</span>. </sentence><sentence id="7969">Wonderful <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="7970"><span class="populated place">Houston</span>, I still sort of scratch my head a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="7971">I haven't kept up with what... there was an appeal of that order. </sentence><sentence id="7972">And I wrote part of the brief on appeal. </sentence><sentence id="7973">Still have it with me. </sentence><sentence id="7974">But I always felt a little badly about the limited result of the pairing of the <span class="building">schools</span>, but I think it helped a great deal in the long run in different ways, to move that system from what it had been, where they had just let the <span class="building">black schools</span> deteriorate into such terrible condition. </sentence><sentence id="7975">Then let's see, Michael was born in 1970, I still had a hearing, a pre-trial, I think, not a pre-trial, but a conference right after he was born. </sentence><sentence id="7976">We delayed it because I expected him to be born in April. </sentence><sentence id="7977">So, that was April 1970. </sentence><sentence id="7978">I think that's about it. </sentence><sentence id="7979">I don't know if you're thinking about something else in the case. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="8059">A: I don't, I don't, no, I don't think I had thought about being out of here. </sentence><sentence id="8060">There were a couple of things probably, one was one of the earliest cases that we were involved with, involved the local <span class="building">health care establishment</span>, for example. </sentence><sentence id="8061">There was a federal program in here, that wanted to set up what is now a federally funded <span class="building">health care clinic</span>, that <span class="building">Eulah Hall</span> was associated with. </sentence><sentence id="8062">But the governing agency was a <span class="building">Community Action agency</span>, which had some public officials and local doctors, who were either on the Board or very close to the governing Board and they basically didn't want this thing to do anything. </sentence><sentence id="8063">They were going to use it primarily as a taxi service to... they had a <span class="spatial object">trailer</span>, which was fully equipped sitting out, for example, at <span class="dlf">Mud Creek</span>, but all they used it for was people would go to the <span class="spatial object">trailer</span> and then they'd drive them into <span class="populated place">Prestonsburg</span> to get their medical services from <span class="populated place">Prestonsburg</span> physicians, that would get money. </sentence><sentence id="8064">So, they were reimbursing them for services, but they wouldn't allow anybody to be treated out there. </sentence><sentence id="8065">Not even a nurse to give them shots. </sentence><sentence id="8066">And then they employed a doctor. </sentence><sentence id="8067">The <span class="building">local medical establishment</span> threw a lot of <span class="dlf">roadblocks</span> into his getting a license. </sentence><sentence id="8068">And it was just a lot of trouble getting it. </sentence><sentence id="8069">So the welfare rights groups came to me and we filed some administrative complaints and basically threatened to close the thing down. </sentence><sentence id="8070">I mean their decision was if it wasn't going to work and be responsive, let's just not have it. </sentence><sentence id="8071">Let's not waste the money. </sentence><sentence id="8072">Well, two things happened, one was, of course, that Jean wasn't sure who her doctor would be, since 108 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="8073">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="8074"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 109 they were all mad at us. </sentence><sentence id="8075">And so she wondered if she could get any child care, any medical care for her son, who was less than a year old, or just about a year old. </sentence><sentence id="8076">And then the <span class="building">establishment</span>, the doctors or the agency complained to Congressman Perkins(r) about it and he asked for an audit by the <span class="building">General Accounting Office</span> of what we were doing, not just in this case. </sentence><sentence id="8077">There was at the same time a lot of hostility by local lawyers to having our get started. </sentence><sentence id="8078">They thought basically we were going to take money out of their pockets. </sentence><sentence id="8079">So the <span class="building">GAO</span> sent an inspector here, which wasn't too... but he was in our <span class="building">office</span> for about a month. </sentence><sentence id="8080">He looked at all, every piece of paper and then he issued... they ended up issuing a report which was really very favorable and complimentary. </sentence><sentence id="8081">And when I called Congressman Perkins to ask him about this thing, about his request, he said not to worry about it. </sentence><sentence id="8082">He was doing it to placate the local officials. </sentence><sentence id="8083">He was sure it was going to work out okay. </sentence><sentence id="8084">So there were things like that. </sentence><sentence id="8085">And I had the local <span class="building">Bar</span> was quite hostile. </sentence><sentence id="8086">I went to them on one occasion and asked them, told them I wanted to set up a system to refer clients to lawyers who, if the clients weren't eligible for our services, if they made too much money, that we wanted a fair system. </sentence><sentence id="8087">So, would they want to give me a list of the lawyers in some order, the ones that would take certain cases and not take...

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="8194">A: Oh I think people who come to you as a lawyer for free service, especially who are just, who realize that lawyers are there, who want to help them and are interested in them and are treating them like people. </sentence><sentence id="8195">And then when they see that in <span class="building">court</span> they are meeting the other side with the same, if not even better, with more competent lawyers, they're pretty proud of that. </sentence><sentence id="8196">And I think the clients have been... always from the first day, even when I was in the <span class="building">Civil Rights Division</span> when I represented the <span class="country">United States</span>, I always admired them a great deal. </sentence><sentence id="8197">Most of them had difficult lives, have serious problems. </sentence><sentence id="8198">They're very genuinely nice people. </sentence><sentence id="8199">They don't always have the advantages that the rest of us have. </sentence><sentence id="8200">Sometimes in the domestic relations cases, there really aren't any winners and the children are losers. </sentence><sentence id="8201">And I don't know... we have a lot of debates in legal services about the value of spending so much time on domestic cases. </sentence><sentence id="8202">And back then probably the divorce rate was probably twenty-five percent, today it's over fifty. </sentence><sentence id="8203">So, the demand for what we do in that <span class="region">area</span>, because people fight over kids. </sentence><sentence id="8204">And the legal system hasn't adjusted. </sentence><sentence id="8205">You have to have a lawyer in these things and there just aren't enough lawyers to go around. </sentence><sentence id="8206">In this <span class="region">area</span> there aren't enough people who can afford lawyers, so you either have people who go without representation, if they don't... or they have to look to us. </sentence><sentence id="8207">But on some of the larger issues, the consumer cases or even the evictions or the others, that generally oftentimes you have an opportunity, to help someone make a real difference in their lives. </sentence><sentence id="8208">As you can see in the case listings that we put together, I think that those are all very significant, very important. </sentence><sentence id="8209">I think that's so, but it was not an easy start. </sentence><sentence id="8210">And now in retrospect, it doesn't seem like it's not such a huge amount of time. </sentence><sentence id="8211">And I think, I've always said I don't twist anybody's arm to come to this program. </sentence><sentence id="8212">You have to want to be happy in a small <span class="populated place">community</span> and that has pluses and minuses. </sentence><sentence id="8213">You can't get lost in anonymity, which I think small <span class="populated place">towns</span> have a lot going for them. </sentence><sentence id="8214">But at the same time you can feel very isolated if you're going uphill, and we often are. </sentence><sentence id="8215">I mean you're stepping on toes a lot. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="8270">A: It seems that <span class="building">companies</span> just won't regulate themselves. </sentence><sentence id="8271">They will not. </sentence><sentence id="8272">We've seen that over and over again, whether it's the <span class="building">chemical industry</span> or the <span class="building">mining industry</span>. </sentence><sentence id="8273">Because where people are looking for profit, primarily, they don't want to shut something, a <span class="dlf">mine</span> down, long enough to fix what's broken or to take real measures to keep dust levels down until somebody has made them do it. </sentence><sentence id="8274">Because every time you do that, you have to slow production down a little bit and you won't produce as much. </sentence><sentence id="8275">So, as a result you have a high incidence of black lung disease and you have an unfriendly <span class="interior space">worker environment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="8276">Finally things have started changing in the last few years. </sentence><sentence id="8277">So now I think it's much more accepted, if that's the right word, I think people even can understand or they see it happening and they see that that's probably one of the roles that we play. </sentence><sentence id="8278">And that we have done over the years, but I think at the same time they can see that what we do is responsible. </sentence><sentence id="8279">That we have good lawyers. </sentence><sentence id="8280">That we don't make up law suits and that generally there's a good reason for what we do. </sentence><sentence id="8281">When we can do something in the <span class="populated place">community</span>, like the <span class="building">housing project</span>, where we're working with public officials, who are now, who want to do something for people who let's say live in substandard <span class="building">housing</span>, out of their own sense of duty or their own feeling that everybody's entitled to have a decent place to live in. </sentence><sentence id="8282">If you've got that sort of in <span class="building">county government</span>, then those are people we can work with and not have to sue. </sentence><sentence id="8283">I mean, I'd like nothing better than to have us, to be able to put ourselves out of business.(Laughing.) </sentence><sentence id="8284">But, I don't know, I think that's a long way off. </sentence></p></dialogue>

wondering... and you also talked about the establishment of the Kentuckians for the Commonwealth, which was called Fair Tax Coalition first, and the work that that organization started on doing. </sentence><sentence id="8306">So I think those were the main things that you talked about during this era that you have been in <span class="populated place">Prestonsburg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="8307">I'm wondering if you want to highlight anything else from those years? </sentence><sentence id="8308">Go into detail about anything else? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="8309">A: Well, I think we've... there are some other sort of unique things that we've done. </sentence><sentence id="8310">I think I'm very proud of the work that we've done on behalf of coal miners, who have refused to work in unsafe conditions. </sentence><sentence id="8311">We established a mine safety project, where we represent those miners in seeking a reinstatement and damages for having been fired unjustly--excuse me--or discriminated against unjustly. </sentence><sentence id="8312">I think that's been real successful. </sentence><sentence id="8313">And the lawyer who did that for a number of years, Tony Oppegard, who is now the Assistant to the Director of the Mine Health and Safety Administration, who was an Appalred lawyer in <span class="region">West Virginia</span> years ago. </sentence><sentence id="8314">I think that's been very significant. </sentence><sentence id="8315">We've represented a lot of disabled coal miners in applications for black lung benefits, this federal program, where so many people, right now, ninety-five percent of the people are denied, because the governmental regulations are so severe and it's so difficult to obtain the claims. </sentence><sentence id="8316">But we still manage... and the <span class="building">private bar</span> hardly does those cases at all. </sentence><sentence id="8317">So we've worked with the Black Lung Association, Bill Worthington, for example, officers of the Black Lung Association, in trying to get <span class="building">Congress</span> to be, relax those requirements and to have better regulations that are fairer, that we see a more reasonable number 112 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="8318">It is not the

collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 113 of people be approved for black lung benefits. </sentence><sentence id="8320">We have won many of those claims, the ones that we've screened and where private attorneys finally gave up. </sentence><sentence id="8321">Because it takes so long for private attorneys to get their fees and because they're so complex and take so long, we're going to get another lawyer to come in pretty soon, nearer in the next few months to do that. </sentence><sentence id="8322">And the mine safety and black lung work sort of go hand in hand. </sentence><sentence id="8323">The same thing is true of coal miner, of pension benefits. </sentence><sentence id="8324">We had a case we went to the <span class="building">United States Supreme Court</span> on involving pension benefits where we lost. </sentence><sentence id="8325">But it really helped them, I think, in some ways to re-write their requirements. </sentence><sentence id="8326">But Gracie, it's the Gracie Robinson case, a woman up here, a widow up in <span class="populated place">Auxier</span>, whose husband had worked over thirty years in the <span class="dlf">coal mines</span>, but had not stopped working and applied. </sentence><sentence id="8327">And he died in the <span class="dlf">coal mines</span> in an accident. </sentence><sentence id="8328">And the requirements for obtaining a widow's pension was that the miner should have applied for a pension and stopped working. </sentence><sentence id="8329">And since he was killed in a <span class="dlf">mine</span> accident they said he hadn't applied for his pension, they wouldn't give her her pension. </sentence><sentence id="8330">We said that was arbitrary. </sentence><sentence id="8331">If he's worked thirty years and you only have to have twenty-five to get a pension. </sentence><sentence id="8332">And he wanted to keep working, that it was like punishment at that point. </sentence><sentence id="8333">We won and then we lost in the <span class="building">District court</span> and then we won in the Court of Appeals for the <span class="populated place">District of Columbia</span> and then we lost in the <span class="building">United States Supreme Court</span>. </sentence><sentence id="8334">But they did actually re-write that provision in the bargaining contract. </sentence><sentence id="8335">But I think the work we do for low, for disabled miners has been really important. </sentence><sentence id="8336">I think the... in the last few years we've started a migrant farm worker program up in <span class="populated place">Richmond</span>, where we got some money from the <span class="building">legal services Corporation</span> to help migrant workers throughout the <span class="region">state</span>. </sentence><sentence id="8337">We have a very small grant. </sentence><sentence id="8338">It's only about 35,000 dollars, so we've done that co-operatively with a program in <span class="region">Texas</span> that represents these folks full time. </sentence><sentence id="8339">And we've managed to file some of the first cases with respect to working conditions. </sentence><sentence id="8340">I mean there are cases where the workers come up here and the grower breaches the contract or at least our workers claim the growers have breached their contract by not providing the working time that they claimed they would or the working conditions under which they would work. </sentence><sentence id="8341">And the program, the <span class="region">Western Kentucky</span> program had the grant a few of years ago and they just could not really find the workers and we were, by getting together with the people in <span class="region">Texas</span>, the paralegal from <span class="country">Texas</span> came up and who helped... who helped to do this project, did the outreach work. </sentence><sentence id="8342">And oh [YAWNS] and for example he would meet the <span class="spatial object">bus</span>, the <span class="spatial object">Greyhound bus</span> coming in at one o'clock in the morning at the <span class="building">station</span> and give out his card to the workers and then they would know how to contact him. </sentence><sentence id="8343">That kind of thing. </sentence><sentence id="8344">And you have to be bilingual, obviously, but I think that's been a very, even though we have very few migrant workers out here in <span class="region">Eastern Kentucky</span>, there are a number of other <span class="region">areas</span> in the state, especially where they have large <span class="dlf">tobacco farms</span> in Western <span class="populated place">Kentucky</span>, that's where we've had so many of our cases. </sentence><sentence id="8345">I think most recently the development of our housing coalition here, called LINKS(r)", where we're doing this huge <span class="building">home</span> repair project. </sentence><sentence id="8346">With all the groups that are coming in from out of <span class="region">state</span>. </sentence><sentence id="8347">And just bringing all these <span class="building">agencies</span> together under one <span class="dlf">roof</span>, so they can collaborate and work together, I think has been a real positive development. </sentence><sentence id="8348">Showing people how they can, I mean we've pulled together a lot of different agencies and non-profits, who are all addressing housing issues, into one collaborative. </sentence><sentence id="8349">And I think everybody's been real pleased with that. </sentence><sentence id="8350">I think we've been able to do that because we don't have any axes to grind or <span class="env feature">turf</span>. </sentence><sentence id="8351">We just said, ""We want to do this and we're willing to do it if you all will cooperate and we can seek funding together, and do some cooperative work." </sentence><sentence id="8352">And so now I actually am sharing a grant with the <span class="building">fiscal court</span>, which would have, and for a worker here, who is a young woman who came from Jean's program. </sentence><sentence id="8353">A participant, who is very, very  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM

President Nixon signed, was this Bill that created this corporation. </sentence><sentence id="8427">And we expanded and got additional money from 1974 to 1980. </sentence><sentence id="8428">And we went from like forty million nationally or fifty, to three hundred and twenty-one. </sentence><sentence id="8429">And when Governor Reagan came in as president he was ready to destroy, to get rid of legal services, because of his experience. </sentence><sentence id="8430">They had sued him in <span class="region">California</span>. </sentence><sentence id="8431">And I won't go through all that history, but really since the Reagan and that first year, instead of getting rid of us they made a compromise and we lost twenty-five percent of our money, which is a lot. </sentence><sentence id="8432">And we've never really recouped that money. </sentence><sentence id="8433">We're now still not at the level we were in 1980. </sentence><sentence id="8434">So that most of us have half as many lawyers as we did in 1981. </sentence><sentence id="8435">We were able to... but there have been many efforts in the meantime in <span class="building">Congress</span> to just eliminate the program. </sentence><sentence id="8436">And we've been able to forestall that, which says a lot. </sentence><sentence id="8437">Because congressional support now is pretty strong. </sentence><sentence

Rogers</span> from <span class="populated place">Somerset</span>. </sentence><sentence id="8440">And whereas he's able to bring back lots of money for other local projects, he has never, either he's not a fan of legal services, or he is trying to mollify the people above him and the others whom he works with, because his latest... for the last couple of years, that committee has passed out a recommended budget which is only about half the size of our funding level, 140 out of 300 million dollars. </sentence><sentence id="8441">And that's been real disappointing, but he likes to say that he is keeping it going and that there are budgetary shortages, and that the other people on his committee are not as strong as he is. </sentence><sentence id="8442">And he would be supportive.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="8498">A: I was talking about the state funding, right? </sentence><sentence id="8499">That we didn't get any more funding this time or that we were... how far did I get with state funding? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="8502">Q: Said that this year, you're at the same level that you were at last year. </sentence><sentence id="8503">You weren't cut anymore, but... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="8506">A: We weren't cut and we were very pleased that we were able to get additional money last time. </sentence><sentence id="8507">We have two sources of state funding, one for the filing fee and one for a general appropriation. </sentence><sentence id="8508">And this time, many programs did not get increases. </sentence><sentence id="8509">There were a lot of one-time expenditures, like the <span class="building">Science Center</span>, got a little more money. </sentence><sentence id="8510">But I think a lot of ongoing projects, except for the new ones like the childcare money that I think actually, some of it's out of the tobacco money. </sentence><sentence id="8511">So, this is a year again, where we have no more new money, <span class="populated place">state</span> or federal. </sentence><sentence id="8512">And that makes it difficult because if you want to give people salary increases, you either have to lose <span class="spatial object">positions</span> or something else to free up additional funds. </sentence><sentence id="8513">I don't know whether... and so there is this tendency in our <span class="building">funding agency</span> to pull programs together. </sentence><sentence id="8514">There is the thought that state- wide programs are more efficient. </sentence><sentence id="8515">I don't think there is any real proof of that anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="8516">I mean I don't know that they have evidence of that. </sentence><sentence id="8517">It may be more efficient to administer, because one person can make a decision instead of four. </sentence><sentence id="8518">You might be able to be more homogeneous around the <span class="region">state</span>. </sentence><sentence id="8519">I would like to think that <span class="building">legal services</span> is here to stay. </sentence><sentence id="8520">I think for the most part it is. </sentence><sentence id="8521">I think there are people in <span class="building">Congress</span>, who think of, that it could be organized differently. </sentence><sentence id="8522">When I was talking about a <span class="building">state-wide organization</span>. </sentence><sentence id="8523">Or whether... I know that one of my counterparts in <span class="region">Virginia</span> would rather be part, consolidate with us, because our client population is so much the same. </sentence><sentence id="8524">The <span class="region">Appalachian counties</span> do have a lot in common. </sentence><sentence id="8525">Whereas in Virginia you have only, all of the state in <span class="region">West Virginia</span> is in <span class="region">Appalachia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="8526">And <span class="populated place">Virginia</span>, a small part of the state is in <span class="region">Appalachia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="8527">So, whether they would allocate enough resources to that one or two programs in that <span class="dlf">corner</span> is something that time will just have to tell. </sentence></p></dialogue>

legal services has been the restrictions that Congress has placed on us in more recent years, which prevent us from filing Class Actions or challenging Welfare Reforms, accepting attorney fees, not being able to represent prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="8554">Those things all seem to, one could view them as making us second class lawyers. </sentence><sentence id="8555">There is no real, rational explanation for them when the preamble to the legal services Corporation Act states that you should not interfere with the professional responsibility to your client. </sentence><sentence

representation from legal services lawyers. </sentence><sentence id="8559">So there's, it's not a very favorable atmosphere to work under. </sentence><sentence id="8560">It doesn't mean we still can't do ninety-five percent of the cases, because many of them still fit into, aren't affected by those prohibitions. </sentence><sentence id="8561">But it is something that needs to be changed. </sentence><sentence id="8562">And it's purely a political affair. </sentence><sentence id="8563">And you have the national opponents of <span class="building">legal services</span>, who are always looking for one more anecdote to pull out as being the kind of thing that goes on. </sentence><sentence id="8564">I mean, no one's perfect. </sentence><sentence id="8565">So you find somebody's statistics aren't quite right and all of a sudden everybody in the <span class="country">country</span> has to be on guard for an inspection, even though we... the way we are funded is by the number of poor people in our <span class="region">areas</span>, not by the number of cases we do. </sentence><sentence id="8566">So there's always a level of, if not harassment, of paperwork that grows and grows and leaves less time for the real work that needs to be done. </sentence><sentence id="8567">But at that same time it's good that we are able to get this money because you really can't fund this kind of work with private fundraising. </sentence><sentence id="8568">You could do a limited amount of it, but not very much. </sentence><sentence id="8569">We, I think we're fortunate to be able to get good lawyers. </sentence><sentence id="8570">We don't pay equivalent salaries. </sentence><sentence id="8571">And we have people coming to work with very large, outstanding loans from undergraduate and <span class="building">law school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="8572">We've instituted a small repayment program that is helpful. </sentence><sentence id="8573">But we've just increased our starting salaries to $27,000, which is a big step forward. </sentence><sentence id="8574">It's still behind many of the <span class="building">private firms</span> and many of the state and <span class="building">federal agencies</span>. </sentence><sentence id="8575">And then we only go up about thirteen hundred a year for, first for nine months and then for a year. </sentence><sentence id="8576">But all the same, I think we're competitive and we have some good benefits. </sentence><sentence id="8577">And we are able, have been fortunate to get people who are really committed. </sentence><sentence id="8578">So I am very proud of the work we do. </sentence><sentence id="8579">I am very proud of the people who are here and who do the work. </sentence><sentence id="8580">We have wonderful relations, I also should mention with the <span class="building">spouse abuse shelters</span>. </sentence><sentence id="8581">That's another project we've started in the last few years, is to have specialists who work, who represent abused spouses at domestic violence hearings. </sentence><sentence id="8582">And we've gotten very involved in that

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="8635">Q: Okay, tape number ten, <span class="dlf">side A</span>, an interview with John Rosenberg. </sentence><sentence id="8636">I guess now would be a good time for you to say something about your work with establishing the <span class="building">Science Center</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="8639">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="8640">Well, I was a chemistry major as I think you know, and I think that we've always known that the scores of our students here in science and math were very low and that science, math and technology was not valued very highly. </sentence><sentence id="8641">So a number of years ago, maybe nineteen, somewhere between 1990 and "92, I asked teachers, some teachers to come together and some other folks in the <span class="populated place">community</span> to see whether we might not start a, developing some ideas for improving math and science, and what they thought. </sentence><sentence id="8642">And what we learned was that teachers were very uneasy about teaching math and science. </sentence><sentence id="8643">Many of them had very poor backgrounds during their teacher training and they were ill-equipped, especially at the <span class="interior space">elementary level</span>, to try to present scientific concepts. </sentence><sentence id="8644">And they really wanted more hands-on activities to support them. </sentence><sentence id="8645">So we, we sort of met periodically and then over the next couple of years. </sentence><sentence id="8646">And then I saw a small video segment, or heard about it, about a <span class="building">college</span> up in <span class="region">Pennsylvania</span>, <span class="region">Western Pennsylvania</span>, <span class="building">Juniata College</span>", which had obtained funding for a <span class="spatial object">science van</span>, where a chemistry teacher was driving a <span class="spatial object">van</span> around and dropping experiments off at <span class="building">high schools</span>, dropping off equipment that the <span class="building">schools</span> couldn't afford to buy. </sentence><sentence id="8647">And was like a sort of Johnny or Jeanie Appleseed, would tell <span class="building">school A</span> about what <span class="building">school B</span> had done with these things. </sentence><sentence id="8648">Over the course of several years the number of incoming students at <span class="building">Juniata College</span> who were, who majored in or who showed an interest in science, studying science-related courses, like tripled. </sentence><sentence id="8649">So, I thought it would be, then got to thinking that we would like to, wouldn't it be nice if we did something like that. </sentence><sentence id="8650">I had not, I don't think had really thought about the <span class="building">planetarium theater</span> kind of thing yet. </sentence><sentence id="8651">But we were meeting and we got a small grant back about 1990, maybe "94 as a result of this work and this group that kept meeting. </sentence><sentence id="8652">We realized that we could maybe establish a <span class="building">center</span> like that if we could get some funding. </sentence><sentence id="8653">So, we got a little money out of the <span class="building">legislature</span>, I think 75,000 dollars to hire a consultant. </sentence><sentence id="8654">One of the legislators here in this <span class="region">area</span>, Greg Stumbo", was interested in technology and with <span class="building">KERA</span>" having come in I think there was a strong, an atmosphere that was conducive to getting some funding. </sentence><sentence id="8655">And I thought we should start off in a small way, so we hired a consultant from <span class="region">West Virginia</span>, Mike Howard, who had worked in the Kentucky educational system, to do some community meetings and help us look at more specifically where we fit and what kind of activities would be helpful. </sentence><sentence id="8656">And it sort of reinforced what we had already known in some ways, that teachers wanted hands-on Mr. Wizard kinds of things. </sentence><sentence id="8657">And that if we could bring presentations to them and do something like the <span class="spatial object">science van</span> and educational programs, that that would be helpful. </sentence><sentence id="8658">And I don't know where I first came up with the idea of trying to do a <span class="building">planetarium</span> or a <span class="building">science museum</span> or really, I thought it might be nice if we could even replicate a <span class="dlf">coal mine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="8659">But I started, we started talking that up and realized that if we had a modern <span class="building">facility</span> it would be really meaningful. </sentence><sentence id="8660">And I also learned that you could, they had these portable planetariums that you could take around to <span class="building">schools</span>, which are little... they call them <span class="building">planetarium</span> in a <span class="spatial object">foot locker</span>, where you blow up, it's like a vinyl thing and you blow it  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 118 up in a <span class="interior space">classroom</span> and you can put thirty kids in it that will watch a star show and other educational shows. </sentence><sentence id="8661">And so, by the time the next <span class="building">legislature</span> rolled around, I think we got 200,000 dollars. </sentence><sentence id="8662">We were able to increase our operating grant and on a fairly short notice we got a local architect to put together just a schematic of what a <span class="building">theater</span> and <span class="building">planetarium</span> might look like and what it could do, and that we would, and that... I think we may have even still been thinking about a <span class="dlf">coal mine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="8663">And we put together a board, I organized a board of directors that included representatives from <span class="populated place">Morehead</span> and from the <span class="building">Alice Lloyd</span>"! </sentence><sentence id="8664">and <span class="building">Pikeville College</span> and <span class="building">PCC</span>" and Hazard and the teachings, the science teachers and the regional educational cooperatives to give us a good cross-section of membership and also a good geographical cross- section. </sentence><sentence id="8665">And it's been, and that's basically the story. </sentence><sentence id="8666">And they helped me, we went to convince them, during the last legislative session, our local legislator agreed to get behind it and we made a presentation to the Governor and he liked it and called me at <span class="building">home</span> one day to go over the budget. </sentence><sentence id="8667">Wanted to know why I had a budget item for rent. </sentence><sentence id="8668">He was very meticulous. " </sentence><sentence id="8669">Why do you need this three hundred dollars when you're going to have...?" </sentence><sentence id="8670">I said, "Governor, we won't be in that place for a couple, few years yet. </sentence><sentence id="8671">We need a <span class="populated place">budget place</span>, we need an <span class="building">office</span>." </sentence><sentence id="8672">But anyway, we got through that with two and a half million dollars, and then this time... so we planned some more, but because of the reorganization of the <span class="building">college</span>, Kentucky college system, <span class="building">KCTCS</span> and UK(tm), the two years went by without any <span class="building">building</span>. </sentence><sentence id="8673">There was a lot of planning, but we just got caught in the upheaval of this educational thing, until <span class="building">KCTCS</span> could get on its feet. </sentence><sentence id="8674">So, in the meantime we put together a proposal for another million dollars, probably should have been for more. </sentence><sentence id="8675">And after all the wrangling, we were one of the fortunate ones at the end to get the million dollars, because Greg Stumbo, who is from here, is a pretty powerful figure and was essentially, he and Benny Ray Bailey, who got beat in this last election, were able to pretty much get all the one-time funding projects through that they asked for. </sentence><sentence id="8676">So, now we are, we just last week had our meeting with the architects and KCTCS folks and college representatives and we are settled on where the <span class="dlf">site</span> is going to be and we have a basic floor plan. </sentence><sentence id="8677">And I hope two years from now the <span class="building">building</span> will be standing. </sentence><sentence id="8678">It probably will be. </sentence><sentence id="8679">And then that means another <span class="building">legislature</span> will have passed and hopefully we might even increase the operating costs of our group. </sentence><sentence id="8680">We got a little more money for that. </sentence><sentence id="8681">But I'm very excited about what we will be able to do, both for students who are in this <span class="region">region</span>, who can't really, who never see this sort of thing at this sophisticated level. </sentence><sentence id="8682">There is now a <span class="building">planetarium</span> at Eastern in <span class="populated place">Richmond</span>, which a lot of people don't even know about. </sentence><sentence id="8683">But I think if we do this well, it can stimulate a lot of interest in science and technology. </sentence><sentence id="8684">We have now decided to expand our <span class="building">laboratory facility</span> so that we will be able to, from a <span class="building">classroom</span> into a sort of <span class="building">laboratory classroom</span>, so we can do experiments in DNA fingerprinting and other chemical experiments, at least demonstrative experiments. </sentence><sentence id="8685">And we're coming up with what I think is pretty exciting. </sentence><sentence id="8686">Our Director we've hired is from <span class="region">Pike County</span>, he was born there, although he grew up in <span class="country">Michigan</span>. </sentence><sentence id="8687">And we have, as I say, a very good <span class="spatial object">board</span> and so I'm, I think that it will be a very important part of the future of <span class="region">Eastern Kentucky</span>. </sentence><sentence id="8688">I think that we now have a new industry in <span class="populated place">Pike County</span>, a knowledge-based industry, where a <span class="building">call center</span>, Microsoft, if you call an 800 number for Microsoft and you need help on your <span class="spatial object">computer</span>, they"!

I think she's living in a good situation. </sentence><sentence id="8880">She's in a <span class="building">high-rise</span> for the elderly up in <span class="populated place">D.C.</span> But she is very dependent on her family, because the people in the <span class="building">house</span>, most of them are her age or older. </sentence><sentence id="8881">Well, they're about, many of them are in their eighties and many of them are not in as good a physical condition, so she's always helping others. </sentence><sentence id="8882">So she hasn't made very many connections with people who are her age and want to keep doing things, other than come down to eat and maybe go shop for groceries. </sentence><sentence id="8883">We see that and so while she is in a mood to want to be able to do that, you know, you kind of want to accommodate her if you can. </sentence><sentence id="8884">But I think between the three of us, we can get to do that. </sentence><sentence id="8885">But when you have a <span class="spatial object">calendar</span> that is related to your work, you're limited in that ability. </sentence><sentence id="8886">You want to plan a trip in August and Jean's got to start back to <span class="building">school</span> or something. </sentence><sentence id="8887">You can't just pick up and go as easily as if you were not working at all. </sentence></p></dialogue>

</sentence><sentence id="8924">I made a copy for her--of a homecoming to <span class="populated place">Leer</span> by members of the <span class="building">Jewish congregation</span>. </sentence><sentence id="8925">You know many of the <span class="populated place">German communities</span> have sort of welcomed back members of the Jewish community, who lived there and who emigrated because of the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="8926">And there is this group that came back to <span class="populated place">Leer</span>. </sentence><sentence id="8927">And there's a film about that group. </sentence><sentence id="8928">Now there were no relatives of mine in that that I know of. </sentence><sentence id="8929">But I would be interested, actually when we were in <span class="populated place">Washington</span> last time and my mother, I was looking for the phone book actually, which is in a <span class="interior space">closet</span>. </sentence><sentence id="8930">And it was sitting on a little book that, I can't remember the name, in German. </sentence><sentence id="8931">It was a German recipe book, in which you wrote recipes and Mother had kept it. </sentence><sentence id="8932">And there was a folded up piece of paper in there and it was a letterhead of my grandfather, of my father's father, Meir Rosenberg, who was a junk dealer, who, unfortunately committed suicide when my father was very small. </sentence><sentence id="8933">Killed himself. </sentence><sentence id="8934">But it was his letterhead, on which my mother had written a recipe. </sentence><sentence id="8935">And she didn't even know she had it, I just happened to unfold that piece of paper. </sentence><sentence id="8936">And the recipe is just something she'd been... wrote in like a little <span class="spatial object">notebook</span>. </sentence><sentence id="8937">But it covered many years. </sentence><sentence id="8938">It was like she started it when she was a new bride. </sentence><sentence id="8939">It was actually bought for her when she was going off on this trip as a young girl, when they sent her off to learn to cook, to a pension that was near <span class="populated place">Frankfurt</span>, which didn't work out. </sentence><sentence id="8940">So she brought it back and started writing. </sentence><sentence id="8941">And it begins in German. </sentence><sentence id="8942">I think over at the end some of the recipes are actually in English in this <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="8943">But she had that thing from Meir Rosenberg, which I don't know where that came from. </sentence><sentence id="8944">And my father, of course, was in a <span class="building">school</span>, in an <span class="building">orphanage</span> in <span class="populated place">Hanover</span>. </sentence><sentence id="8945">And I've never, because when his father died after a few years during the Depression, there were nine kids at <span class="building">home</span> and so his mother just physically, could not economically take care of them and she sent three of them off to an <span class="building">orphanage</span> in <span class="populated place">Hanover</span>. </sentence><sentence id="8946">I've never looked into, I don't know much about that period. </sentence><sentence id="8947">And his brothers and sisters, of course, are dead. </sentence><sentence id="8948">I think one of his sisters, who is now dead, who went to <span class="country">Israel</span>, did go back to <span class="populated place">Leer</span> and sort of close the chapter on that. </sentence><sentence id="8949">And I don't know the <span class="building">business</span>, you know, went out. </sentence><sentence id="8950">We did go to <span class="building">Mother's home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="8951">I think I may have mentioned. </sentence><sentence id="8952">The <span

on either side of the <span class="building">house</span>... which I suspect is due to the fact that her dad ran a <span class="building">butcher shop</span> and they slaughtered animals. </sentence><sentence id="8954">And when he went into the, when they left in 1936 and it was taken over, they continued using it as a <span class="building">butcher shop</span> and I think it probably just rotted. </sentence><sentence id="8955">Because of its use and constantly having water and blood and other... being used as a <span class="building">manufacturing facility</span>, probably just, you know, decayed. </sentence><sentence id="8956">But we met a number of her contemporaries in that <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="8957">There's still a <span

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="9078">Maybe it's not a question, maybe it's just an observation, but you've, in your work have kind of devoted yourself to people who, really you naturally don't share a whole lot in common with, I mean as far as your own background and your own tradition. </sentence><sentence id="9079">And in some ways that's why... </sentence></p><p><sentence id="9080">because those people were separated from mainstream culture and because they were disadvantaged in various ways, that's why you felt the need to work with them. </sentence><sentence id="9081">But yet it seems that your own tradition as a Jew and as a refugee from <span class="country">Nazi Germany</span> has been an important part of your identity. </sentence><sentence id="9082">I kind of wonder how you've kept that connection with your roots and with that tradition alive and whether that's been a difficult balance for you in a context that's so separate from it. </sentence><sentence id="9083">I think so many Jews and in particular so many refugees, so many survivors have felt the need to be among people who really understand what they've been through and who had experienced something similar to what they'd experienced. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9084">A: Well, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="9085">I think some people just feel the need to continue to... I mean I think you have stated it, that there are people who want to be in an atmosphere where they think others are, that only people who have been through something like that or close to it, can understand them. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="9086">Maybe it's just like our veterans or sometimes they're the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="9087">I mean, I've appreciated being in <span class="region">Eastern Kentucky</span> very much, in terms of also learning about this culture and its history. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="9088">122 </sentence></p><p><sentence id="9089"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="9090">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="9091"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="9092"> <span class="building">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.05*0007 123 The crafts and the independence of people who are here and their ancestors. </sentence><sentence id="9093">I've always admired people who have lived in a rugged way, and appreciated the <span class="env feature">environment</span>, and... </sentence></p><p><sentence id="9094"> End of Tape 10, <span class="interior space">Side A 123</span> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="9095">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="9096"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 124 Tape 10, <span class="dlf">Side B</span> </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9097">A: I've always liked being in smaller <span class="populated place">towns</span>. </sentence><sentence id="9098">Just the trusting nature of people who are in smaller <span class="populated place">communities</span>, whether it's <span class="populated place">Gastonia</span> or whether it's rural people generally. </sentence><sentence id="9099">And people who, we used to, I used to say when I worked selling chemicals up <span class="region">North</span> it's... again you never, you always wonder about generalizing, but it's like when you're a salesperson, if you walk into a place in the <span class="region">South</span>, people assume that they can trust you until you prove that you are not trustworthy and do something wrong. </sentence><sentence id="9100">And then you're done for. </sentence><sentence id="9101">As opposed to going into many of the <span class="populated place">urban places</span> where one might think that, they begin by thinking they can't trust you and that you're going to pull one over on them. </sentence><sentence id="9102">And it takes a long time to have them either trust you or have some confidence in you. </sentence><sentence id="9103">That's probably, you know, it may be that that's old hat. </sentence><sentence id="9104">I think there's still a lot of that here. </sentence><sentence id="9105">And that that's just sort of being country people. </sentence><sentence id="9106">I don't know, in terms of not having that much of a surrounding, maybe part of that may be the fact that I'm married to a Quaker. </sentence><sentence id="9107">I mean I did not marry someone who is Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="9108">And we accommodate that to the way we want to, and once you... so you make somewhat of a break from the tradition that permeates the <span class="building">homes</span> of Jewish couples and families where both couples are Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="9109">So, Jean is, obviously gave up some of her ties to being in a <span class="dlf">Quaker environment</span> where she was a very much involved in young Friends activities and probably never foresaw that she would be married to somebody who was Jewish, although Quakers are very, probably the most tolerant group, religious group that is out there. </sentence><sentence id="9110">So maybe that has something to do with it. </sentence><sentence id="9111">You know, I can never look into somebody else's brain and I don't know what motivates people, why people happen to be narrow-minded or not narrow minded, or what... You know, there are great differences among Jews, as you were saying at lunch, in the way, in the philosophy of the <span class="building">Holocaust Museum</span> and how it should be run. </sentence><sentence id="9112">I have, my mother's sister, at least one if not both of them, but one of them for certain, would say she would never step foot into <span class="country">Germany</span> again. </sentence><sentence id="9113">I mean there are many Jews who came from there, who think it's heretical to go back to <span class="country">Germany</span> and would never forgive anybody and would draw the <span class="dlf">line</span> in the <span class="env feature">sand</span>. </sentence><sentence id="9114">Whereas Mom went back and would go and continue to have some correspondence

you kind of try to get the most out of what you can, wherever you happen to be. </sentence><sentence id="9119">And that has been pretty, I think that in terms of relationships here hasn't been that

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9752">A: Well, we're talking about and I was thinking about how you maintain your Judaism as it were. </sentence><sentence id="9753">A few years ago we learned that there was still a congregation in <span class="populated place">Williamson</span>, <span class="region">West Virginia</span>, which is about thirty-five miles from here, much closer than <span class="populated place">Lexington</span> and we went over there one Friday night. </sentence><sentence id="9754">And found a very friendly group of people, who were meeting sort of monthly and being served by the rabbi from <span class="populated place">Huntington</span>, <span class="region">West Virginia</span>, who comes down on a Sunday night to do a Friday night service. </sentence><sentence id="9755">And the <span class="building">synagogue</span> is an old, old <span class="building">synagogue</span>. </sentence><sentence id="9756">I don't know, probably a hundred years old at least. </sentence><sentence id="9757">It sits up on top of a <span class="env feature">hill</span> in the <span class="region">black section</span> of <span class="populated place">Williamson</span>. </sentence><sentence id="9758">And there's no <span class="spatial object">elevator</span> and you've got to walk up a huge bunch of <span class="dlf">steps</span>, well, probably twenty-five. </sentence><sentence id="9759">And the average age of the people other than us is about seventy. </sentence><sentence id="9760">But they've kept on going and they consist of folks from <span class="populated place">Welch</span> and <span class="populated place">Grundy</span> and nearby people who are in a probably twenty, thirty mile area from around <span class="populated place">Williamson</span>. </sentence><sentence id="9761">I think twenty years ago during the height of the coal mining in this <span class="region">area</span> and maybe through the seventies and eighties I think they had fifty families. </sentence><sentence id="9762">Over the years the kids have moved away and so the older members of the Williamson Jewish community are still there. </sentence><sentence id="9763">And the President is a fellow named Bill Rosen, whose son is now a circuit judge in <span class="populated place">Ashland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="9764">But it's been a nice group of people, and the rabbi, who is from <span class="populated place">Huntington</span>, is an interesting personality. </sentence><sentence id="9765">His wife teaches a, not Headstart, but Upward Bound program. </sentence><sentence id="9766">And I've actually been... the rabbi teaches a class at <span class="building">Marshall University</span> on Jewish studies. </sentence><sentence id="9767">And so I've visited his class and spoke about the Holocaust as sort of a living survivor. </sentence><sentence id="9768">But it is interesting, and then it's much nicer to go to a congregation of that sort, where every person that comes is one more person that makes a difference, rather than going to <span class="populated place">Lexington</span>, where you've got a large congregation at <span class="populated place">Adath Israel</span> and there's also the Conservative, the <span class="building">Orthodox congregation</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="9769">So, that's been very nice. </sentence><sentence id="9770">We actually have, there are other, three other Jewish mixed couples here. </sentence><sentence id="9771">Miriam Silman, whose father, by the way, had the contract to, was an engineer, who re-did, who did the plans to re-do <span class="populated place">Mount Vernon</span>. </sentence><sentence id="9772">And then Pam Weiner, whose husband is from here, from <span class="populated place">Pike County</span>, and is a Buddhist. </sentence><sentence id="9773">They just had a baby. </sentence><sentence id="9774">And then Deborah Golden, who is a lawyer with my <span class="building">Pikeville office</span>. </sentence><sentence id="9775">And then there is another couple in <span class="populated place">Pikeville</span>, Terry Mulliken, who's a lawyer. </sentence><sentence id="9776">His wife, Cynthia, has been on my Board. </sentence><sentence id="9777">It used to be there's a large family in <span class="populated place">Pikeville</span> that used to go to <span class="populated place">Williamson</span>, their name Yaruses. </sentence><sentence id="9778">They're friends of ours. </sentence><sentence id="9779">But they, and they go, now they're older and they go once ina while. </sentence><sentence id="9780">But the <span class="populated place">Williamson community</span> was sort of the hub of the Jewish residents of this <span class="region">area</span> for many years. </sentence><sentence id="9781">Now there are probably twenty families that are left. </sentence><sentence id="9782">One of the younger set married, a young woman married an Israeli when she was in <span class="country">Israel</span> and they have a little boy. </sentence><sentence id="9783">They've recently been divorced. </sentence><sentence id="9784">Very few young members. </sentence><sentence id="9785">But it is there and we have, we joined that congregation, so that we once again do have a, sort of a formal tie to a Jewish community that's here, for whatever it's worth. </sentence><sentence id="9786">I guess it's worth putting that down. </sentence></p></dialogue>

I don't know how many more years they can do that. </sentence><sentence id="9837">There's not a very strong <span class="building">base</span> down below. </sentence><sentence id="9838">Someone did a series in <span class="region">West Virginia</span>, I think it may have even been in <span class="building">The New York Times</span>, an article on old congregations. </sentence><sentence id="9839">And someone did a project in <span class="region">Kentucky</span>, didn't they? </sentence><sentence id="9840">On <span class="building">Jewish synagogues</span> in <span class="region">Kentucky</span>, a few years ago? </sentence></p></dialogue>
