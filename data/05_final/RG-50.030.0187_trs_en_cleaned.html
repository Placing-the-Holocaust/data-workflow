<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="55">Q: Then you and your father...where did you and your father go? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="57">A: My father we stayed in <span class="country">Slovakia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="58">My father, I understand, was quite desperate because, of course, he couldn't find any work and he was practically just waiting for the opportunity still to get out and one day in March or April 1942, he got an invitation to report to the <span class="building">railroad station</span>, that he will be taken to a <span class="populated place">labor camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="59">So the night before that happened, he wrote a note which I have...was given to me after the war, where he authorizes my aunt to hand me over to a Jewish family in that small little <span class="populated place">town</span> in <span class="country">Slovakia</span> that was supposed to be protected from deportation because they had what was called either the yellow or the white exemption which could have been bought from the Slovak government. </sentence><sentence id="60">This yellow/white exemption indication that the person is important for the Slovak economy. </sentence><sentence id="61">This was already ,<span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> did not exist anymore, the Slovak 01:05: State, a puppet state put together by Hitler, and Hitler installed the Slovak fascist government. </sentence><sentence id="62">The head of it was Monsieur Tiso. </sentence><sentence id="63">This was already the <span class="region">Slovak State</span>. </sentence><sentence id="64">So when they took my father I still stayed with my aunt. </sentence><sentence id="65">A few weeks later, they came to take my aunt and her husband and the maid. </sentence><sentence id="66">They had a maid. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="79">Q: What was her name? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="81">A: Was Agnes. </sentence><sentence id="82"><span class="building">Agnes Rebunska</span>. </sentence><sentence id="83">And she woke me up and I remember this...this actually [is] one of the first recollections that I have about this time. </sentence><sentence id="84">She just sent me out of the <span class="building">house</span> in this little <span class="populated place">town</span> named <span class="populated place">Piestany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="85">And she pointed the direction to me, the neighboring <span class="populated place">village</span> where her parents lived. </sentence><sentence id="86">I basically knew that <span class="populated place">village</span> because she would take me there over the weekends. </sentence><sentence id="87">So I ran to this <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="88">On the <span class="dlf">road</span> somebody picked me up on a <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span>, brought me to her parents, and from there on based on that authorization that my father wrote just before he was taken to <span class="populated place">Majdanek</span> I was given to this family who had these exemptions, the yellow/white exemptions. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="97">Q: When Agnes Acnes got you out of there, and this is one of your first recollections, remember how you...what you saw that would be. </sentence><sentence id="98">Did you have any feelings about it at that time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="101">A: Feelings I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="102">I remember thoughts that it seemed to me too far. </sentence><sentence id="103">The <span class="populated place">village</span> seemed to me too far, and that I was very relieved when one of the young men from the <span class="populated place">village</span> who was on his way either to <span class="building">school</span> or to a job in that small <span class="populated place">town</span> took me on the <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span>, turned around, brought me to the <span class="populated place">village</span> and handed me over to the parents. </sentence><sentence id="104">I recall much better when I was then brought to this family. </sentence><sentence id="105">The name was Pollack. </sentence><sentence id="106">They knew my father. </sentence><sentence id="107">And when I arrived there they had a 19 year old son and they asked me This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="108">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="109"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection to feel at <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="110">This will be my <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="111">Incidentally, from this family's <span class="interior space">balcony</span> I was watching when my father left for the <span class="building">railroad station</span> to report to the <span class="populated place">labor camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="112">They told him that he will go to a small <span class="populated place">town</span> named <span class="populated place">Novaki</span>, which was just...I don't know, maybe 25 miles from <span class="populated place">Piestany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="113">And I also recall that people were telling him, "Mr. Reiss, don't go. </sentence><sentence id="114">You are going to be taken somewhere else, not to a <span class="populated place">labor camp</span>." </sentence><sentence id="115">And he just dismissed this and I remember standing on the <span class="interior space">balcony</span> and waving to him. </sentence><sentence id="116">It was the last time I saw him. </sentence><sentence id="117">And after that I had to go to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="118">I was a first grader in the <span class="building">Jewish school</span> which was just around the corner from this family's <span class="building">house</span> so that my last recollection of seeing my father... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="140">Q: You had no notion that that was the last time you would see your father? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="142">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="143">No. </sentence><sentence id="144">Neither did my father, because my father wrote a card which I have at <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="145">I have it framed at <span class="building">home</span>, smuggled it out of that <span class="spatial object">car</span>, and the card says in German, "We are full of optimism, and we are looking forward to all that's to come and we will stay in <span class="populated place">Novaki</span>. </sentence><sentence id="146">And there and then he sends regards to several friends so he did not know, and of course, I had no idea. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="152">Q: And you're with the Pollack family. </sentence><sentence id="153">Can you tell us what happened them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="156">A: The Pollack family. </sentence><sentence id="157">And 6 weeks, maybe 6 weeks later, with this yellow exemption or white exemption disregarded, we went to the first <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> which was <span class="populated place">Zilina</span>, which is about, 100 miles from <span class="populated place">Piestany</span> and also in <span class="region">northern Slovakia</span>, but it's also very close to the <span class="dlf">Polish border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="158">And from there to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> is a very short distance. </sentence><sentence id="159">I don't know...maybe a hundred miles maybe, a little bit more, but certainly not much more. </sentence><sentence id="160">There I already recall that we were very cramped in this <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="161">And I was 7 and I was looking at the <span class="spatial object">cattle cars</span> being filled with people and I remember I always enjoyed <span class="spatial object">trains</span>. </sentence><sentence id="162">A <span class="spatial object">train</span> ride was always something I was looking forward to...incidentally to this day. </sentence><sentence id="163">And I was just waiting..."when will our turn come," so I did not view it as something negative. </sentence><sentence id="164">I wanted to take a <span class="spatial object">train</span> ride. </sentence><sentence id="165">I got different feelings when I saw that they closed the <span class="spatial object">cattle cars</span> and the <span class="spatial object">train</span> was just standing there and some people were screaming for <span class="env feature">water</span>. </sentence><sentence id="166">And also what frightened me, there wasn't...there wasn't one German. </sentence><sentence id="167">This was all administered by the Slovaks, by the so called Hlinka guard. </sentence><sentence id="168">Was the fascist uniformed members of the Hlinka party. </sentence><sentence id="169">And one day I was wondering through this <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="170">There were wooden <span class="building">barracks</span> and one of these Hlinka guards...I don't know whether they took pity on me. </sentence><sentence id="171">I don't know what I looked like. </sentence><sentence id="172">But he invited me into a large <span class="building">warehouse</span> and there were all these knapsacks and there was food, canned food. </sentence><sentence id="173">Sardines. </sentence><sentence id="174">And there were lemons I remember. </sentence><sentence id="175">And he said, "Take what you want." </sentence><sentence id="176">And I was...I believed quite a street smart kid, so I put some string around my pants and I stuffed the pants with all kinds of foods, cans, sardines. </sentence><sentence id="177">And I brought it to the <span class="building">barrack</span> where we were staying. </sentence><sentence id="178">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="179">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="180"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection And I remember a great feeling of satisfaction because I distributed food. </sentence><sentence id="181">There wasn't starvation really there. </sentence><sentence id="182">We were fed. </sentence><sentence id="183">I believe twice a day we were getting some soup. </sentence><sentence id="184">And this was basically just a <span class="populated place">transit camp</span>, a <span class="populated place">camp</span> where people arrived, loaded in the <span class="spatial object">cattle cars</span> and sent on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="215">Q: How did you get out of there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="217">A: Well, this man...this Pollack was a dentist in <span class="populated place">Piestany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="218">He had a brother named Arthur. </sentence><sentence id="219">Arthur was in <span class="populated place">Bratislava</span> which is the capital of <span class="country">Slovakia</span> and he was by profession a printer and he had a very influential friend and professional colleague from the <span class="building">printing business</span> whose name was Shajno Mach (ph.). </sentence><sentence id="220">He was a minister of interior in the fascist government of Monsignor Tiso in charge of solving the Jewish question of <span class="country">Slovakia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="221">And Shajno Mach and Arthur Pollack were friends, drinking friends, card playing friends, fellow printers. </sentence><sentence id="222">And Arthur was sort of a bon vivant as a I always understood, a womanizer. </sentence><sentence id="223">All kinds of vices, but he was also very close friend of Shajno Mach. </sentence><sentence id="224">So Arthur, as I understand, went to <span class="populated place">Shaino Mach</span> and he arranged that we were released from <span class="populated place">Sered</span>. </sentence><sentence id="225">I remember that one day a <span class="spatial object">car</span> showed up and we were let out. </sentence><sentence id="226">And the magic word was a phonogram. </sentence><sentence id="227">| did not know what a phonogram was, but I can still visualize it. </sentence><sentence id="228">It was a white piece of paper with something written on it, and it had a red stripe across. </sentence><sentence id="229">And this was the paper that gave the orders to let us go. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="243">Q: Did you have any idea that you are being rescued from death by that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="245">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="246">No. </sentence><sentence id="247">Quite the con...I think I was...I was... | must have had mixed feelings. </sentence><sentence id="248">I don't know exactly, but I know that part of the feeling was there will be no <span class="spatial object">train</span> ride. </sentence><sentence id="249">So that was the negative feeling. </sentence><sentence id="250">But I already saw some misery. </sentence><sentence id="251">I remember and I can still visualize it. </sentence><sentence id="252">There was a man laying on a <span class="spatial object">stretcher</span>. </sentence><sentence id="253">There were many people around him. </sentence><sentence id="254">And it bothered me terribly because this man was not 01:15: supposed to be there. </sentence><sentence id="255">He was ill. </sentence><sentence id="256">He was supposed to be in some kind of a <span class="interior space">therapeutic environment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="257">I couldn't verbalize it at that time in this way, but I just remember that this was disturbing. </sentence><sentence id="258">The other disturbing thing was that we had extremely small <span class="interior space">space</span> and we were sleeping on the <span class="interior space">floor</span> and we were sleeping on straw. </sentence><sentence id="259">And this was again something that doesn't happen to you when you are in comfortable times. </sentence><sentence id="260">So it must have been a mixed bag but that I am not going to take a <span class="spatial object">train</span> ride that bothered me. </sentence><sentence id="261">So we got out of there and we knew that we have to go into a semi-hiding. </sentence><sentence id="262">So we went to a <span class="populated place">town</span> called <span class="populated place">Bardell</span> (ph) which is in <span class="region">eastern Slovakia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="263">And there we rented an <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="264">Pollack could no longer practice as a independent dentist, but he took employment with a Jewish dentist. </sentence><sentence id="265">It was 1942. </sentence><sentence id="266">And we stayed in this <span class="populated place">town</span> til 1943. </sentence><sentence id="267">I went to <span class="building">school</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="268">And then some how things became bad. </sentence><sentence id="269">Was either end of 1943 or even the beginning of 1944. </sentence><sentence id="270">and Pollack decided that we have to go into hiding again. </sentence><sentence id="271">Not complete hiding, but just out of site into some location where we will be safer than in <span class="populated place">Bardell</span> which is a quite Slovak This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="272">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="273"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection conditions, quite a big <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="274">Let's say it had 20,000 inhabitants. </sentence><sentence id="275">And he made a very unfortunate decision. </sentence><sentence id="276">He decided together with two extended families, maybe some 35 people, that all of us are going to go back to <span class="region">Western Slovakia</span> to a <span class="populated place">village</span> named <span class="populated place">Sharfia</span> (ph.), </sentence><sentence id="277">near <span class="populated place">Nitra</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="314">Q: Hadn't some of you become nominally Lutherans at that point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="316">A: We came Lutherans in <span class="populated place">Bardell</span>. </sentence><sentence id="317">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="318">In <span class="populated place">Bardell</span> we...we attended <span class="building">church</span>. </sentence><sentence id="319">We got papers that we were Lutherans. </sentence><sentence id="320">I still have the baptismal certificate. </sentence><sentence id="321">And it was a serious situation, yet it was a funny situation too because Pollack was brought up in a <span class="building">Yeshiva</span> and was brought up as an Orthodox Jew. </sentence><sentence id="322">And to see this man forcing me and his wife to go to a Lutheran service was quite a funny sight. </sentence><sentence id="323">And on top of everything, he would also use every opportunity and go to a <span class="building">synagogue</span>. </sentence><sentence id="324">I don't think it was a <span class="building">synagogue</span> anymore. </sentence><sentence id="325">It was a <span class="spatial object">stiebel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="326">It was a <span class="building">prayer hall</span>, but nevertheless came, so the same man who on a Sunday would piously sit in a <span class="building">church</span> with us, on a Friday night on a Shabat or on a holiday would put on his talith and pray in a stiebel. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="338">Q: Were you aware of the incongruity of that at the time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="340">A: Oh yes. </sentence><sentence id="341">Oh yes. </sentence><sentence id="342">I was 8 and I remember I had a friend there whose name was Thury, who I will tell you a very sad story about Thury. </sentence><sentence id="343">His name was Arthur. </sentence><sentence id="344">His nickname was Thury. </sentence><sentence id="345">And I remember we were somehow discussing it and had a good time discussing the funny aspect of that. </sentence><sentence id="346">Because his family had nothing to do with the Lutherans. </sentence><sentence id="347">We were 01:19: the ones. </sentence><sentence id="348">I don't know why. </sentence><sentence id="349">I don't know how it happened, but we were the ones who attended the Lutheran services. </sentence><sentence id="350">So now Pollack took this maybe 35 peoople to this <span class="populated place">village</span> of <span class="populated place">Sharfia</span>, and it was a very stupid decision because first of all, this <span class="populated place">village</span> alone had many Hlinka guards. </sentence><sentence id="351">And one evening somebody came to tell us...somebody from the <span class="populated place">village</span>, "Listen, tomorrow the Nazis are coming with the Hlinka guards." </sentence><sentence id="352">There were already Germans in the <span class="country">country</span>. " </sentence><sentence id="353">And they're going to take everybody." </sentence><sentence id="354">And Pollack did not want to do anything about it. </sentence><sentence id="355">We were urged to go into the <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="356">Pollack had a son who was 19, 20 by that time. </sentence><sentence id="357">Maybe 21 by that time. </sentence><sentence id="358">And he said, "If you don't want to go, I am taking the child (meaning me) and my mother and we are asking anybody else who wants to leave to leave with us into the <span class="env feature">forest</span>." </sentence><sentence id="359">By the way, Pollack also brought to this <span class="populated place">village</span> his brother, the baby that was about 4 months old. </sentence><sentence id="360">All in all there were maybe over 40 people. </sentence><sentence id="361">So the son of his, Marcel took us. </sentence><sentence id="362">He finally... he relented. </sentence><sentence id="363">His brother went too with a child that was my age, and his third brother stayed with his 4 month old child. </sentence><sentence id="364">So only the two families, we left at night for the <span class="env feature">woods</span>. </sentence><sentence id="365">Sunday morning, <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> appeared with Hlinka guards, with Nazis, loaded up everybody and took them to a <span class="populated place">village</span> called <span class="populated place">Nemchita</span>. </sentence><sentence id="366">A few miles from this spot they had to dig out their own <span class="dlf">grave</span> and they were all executed there. </sentence><sentence id="367">The children were not...they're not even shot. </sentence><sentence id="368">They were just This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="369">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="370"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection buried alive. </sentence><sentence id="371">And I know that because after the war Pollack went to the exhumation. </sentence><sentence id="372">And I was there too. </sentence><sentence id="373">I was on the side. </sentence><sentence id="374">I did not see the act in itself, and I know that that was the conclusion. </sentence><sentence id="375">The children were not even killed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="415">Q: Did you know about what had happened, though, in <span class="populated place">Sharfia</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="417">A: Oh, yes. </sentence><sentence id="418">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="419">And incidently, this Thury whom I mentioned from <span class="populated place">Bardell</span>, we had a fight shortly after we arrived in this <span class="populated place">village</span>, the two of us, and either I pushed him or he fell and he had quite a large wound on his leg. </sentence><sentence id="420">And when they exhumed him, he still had the bandages on his leg. </sentence><sentence id="421">Well, now they are buried in a <span class="interior space">mass grave</span> near this. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="427">Q: At the time this event took place, you and the Pollacks were in the <span class="env feature">woods</span>...in the <span class="env feature">forest</span>, so you had escaped this and you heard about it after you returned. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="429">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="431">Q: You weren't directly involved? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="597">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="598">He was asked whether he has any money and he said he doesn't have. </sentence><sentence id="599">Had he said he has money...had he just lent it to his brother, we would have been safe because I remember the number of bank notes and the bank notes were in thousand crown denominations. </sentence><sentence id="600">That would have saved us. </sentence><sentence id="601">So as we were standing there and the man got hysterical, suddenly somebody came from the <span class="populated place">village</span> on a <span class="spatial object">motorcycle</span>, a Nazi, and gave instructions. </sentence><sentence id="602">I did not hear him what he was saying, but it was obvious because they stopped everything and they took us down the <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="603">Later we found out that the instruction was to take us down to the <span class="populated place">village</span> to put us on a <span class="spatial object">truck</span> and to take us to <span class="populated place">Nitra</span>, which was the <span class="populated place">county town</span>, into the <span class="building">jail</span> and to find out from us where the Partisans are. </sentence><sentence id="604">That we must know because we were caught in the <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="707">A: Must have been a patient of his. </sentence><sentence id="708">I don't know exactly how. </sentence><sentence id="709">I think he was a patient of his who used to come to <span class="populated place">Piestany</span> to take a cure. </sentence><sentence id="710"><span class="populated place">Piestany</span> is a <span class="building">spa</span>, quite a well known <span class="building">spa</span> for treating rheumatism. </sentence><sentence id="711">And then just a day or so later, Pollack was called by the commandant of the <span class="building">prison</span>. </sentence><sentence id="712">I believe his name was Cunsa. </sentence><sentence id="713">I am almost sure it was <span class="building">Cunsa</span>. </sentence><sentence id="714">And he told Pollack...
