<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="135">Q: When did you start becoming aware of <span class="country">Europe</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="137">A: I think because of the interest in reading we had, we were really quite young, because Mother's two spinster sisters had both been to <span class="country">Europe</span>. </sentence><sentence id="138">Quite unusual at that particular time is these young women, they were teachers, basically, they had both been in <span class="country">Europe</span>. </sentence><sentence id="139">My Aunt Agnes had -- had been in <span class="country">Germany</span> a number of times and studied there. </sentence><sentence id="140">Aunt Belle had been with her also. </sentence><sentence id="141">But we would have, when Aunt Belle and Aunt -- Aunt Agnes were there, talks about <span class="country">Europe</span> and visiting about Europe. </sentence><sentence id="142">So really as younger people we were aware of at least <span class="country">Europe</span>. </sentence><sentence id="143">Not the rest of the world, but Europe, certainly. </sentence><sentence id="144">And I'm speaking now This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="145">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="146"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Richard Peterson " April 6, 1999 of -- of ages probably of 10 and 12, maybe eight, we were aware of <span class="country">Europe</span>. </sentence><sentence id="147">News-wise, later though, because it wasn't of course until I was getting into later <span class="building">grade school</span> that the world news became more and more important. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="159">Q: Did your parents talk that over with you? </sentence><sentence id="160">How aware were you of the situation getting worse in <span class="country">Europe</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="163">A: We were aware because first of all we had the "<span class="building">Des Moines Register</span>," the state paper that the folks read avidly, they would discuss it. </sentence><sentence id="164">We had radio news basically as well, too. </sentence><sentence id="165">So I think probably as -- as things were beginning to develop, I remember discussions of the Spanish Civil War, that would be what, in the late 1930's. </sentence><sentence id="166">And then of course when the war itself began in the first or second of September 1939, why, we were much, much aware of it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="171">Q: What was your personal reaction when -- in September "39? </sentence><sentence id="172">Do you remember that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="175">A: Yes, [remember quite clearly because that morning, I remember coming into the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>, the paper was there and Dad was very disturbed, having read the -- the war that -- the word had come that -- that of course as we remember, <span class="country">Germany</span> had moved into the -- in-into -- into <span class="populated place">Danzig</span>, and then that the British gave the ultimatum and I remember the talk, we all heard Neville Chamberlain saying that they were given ultimatum, we have rece -- [indecipherable] undertaking, so This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="176">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="177"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Richard Peterson deg April 6, 1999 we're therefore at war. </sentence><sentence id="178">I remember Dad being disturbed, Mother to a degree too, but I-I think -- I think maybe -- maybe Dad was more evident about it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="183">Q: And you were in what grade? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="185">A: Well, I would have been at that time, which was 1939, in -- I'd bega -- I began <span class="building">school</span> as a five year old in 1930, so I-- I would have been about the eighth or ninth grade at that time, or in that period. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="187">Q: Did you feel threatened at all by that news? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="189">A: Not really, not really. </sentence><sentence id="190">That came a bit later. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="193">Q: Okay, so you continued to go to <span class="building">school</span> in 1939. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="197">Q: And your life did not change immediately? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="230">Q: And did you respond in any way, did you feel threatened then, because of the connection to your family? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="232">A: Oh, I think -- I think not too much at that time. </sentence><sentence id="233">We knew things of course were getting much more so because following that of course we recall <span class="country">Norway</span> fell, and then of course <span class="country">Germany</span> moved into -- in to the <span class="region">low countries</span> and on and then of course there was a lot of awareness when the German [indecipherable] went through the <span class="region">Ardennes</span>, to the great -- the great shock and surprise of the French and British. </sentence><sentence id="234">And then of course the -- the escape of the British at <span class="populated place">Dunkirk</span> to get across, we -- that was a lot in the news, we were very, very aware of that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
