The <span class="building">house</span> was sparkling. </sentence><sentence id="71">Uh...I was a bookworm. </sentence><sentence id="72">I remember lying on my belly on the <span class="interior space">floor</span> and seeing my reflection in the linoleum. </sentence><sentence id="73">Uh...I was lost in books. </sentence><sentence id="74">Uh...But I also had friends out in the <span class="dlf">streets</span> and...uh...used to play...uh...kicking the ball around and playing with those little marbles which at that time were clay, glossy clay balls. </sentence><sentence id="75">As a matter of fact, some were glass, but I liked the clay better because they were so beautifully colored. </sentence><sentence id="76">Uh... do remember vividly. </sentence><sentence id="77">Now before...before I come to the <span class="building">elementary school</span>, I want to say that there were two...uh...facts that I vividly recall. </sentence><sentence id="78">First of all, I had a rather strict father. </sentence><sentence id="79">And that was very much in accordance with the fashion of the times. </sentence><sentence id="80">These were patriotic figures. </sentence><sentence id="81">And I loved him very much. </sentence><sentence id="82">I remember the intense joy that I had when I heard the... his key grating in the lock. </sentence><sentence id="83">I knew it was my father's key. </sentence><sentence id="84">And I knew more or less what time he would come <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="85">Mother was a very affectionate woman. </sentence><sentence id="86">I am afraid that she...uh...she spoiled me. </sentence><sentence id="87">She was over-protective. </sentence><sentence id="88">She was always hovering over me when I was eating. </sentence><sentence id="89">The side effect, of course, was that I became the worst eater in <span class="country">Europe</span>. </sentence><sentence id="90">I mean it just came to a point that I couldn't even look at a cup of coffee or milk or whatever and not feel sick. </sentence><sentence id="91">I was a very, very bad eater. </sentence><sentence id="92">Yal. </sentence><sentence id="93">So that...that...that was...that was a strong memory. </sentence><sentence id="94">Uh...Somehow...uh...I was very much of a dreamer. </sentence><sentence id="95"><span class="spatial object">Books</span> were my world of escape. </sentence><sentence id="96">And I managed to enter this <span class="env feature">world</span> and close the <span class="dlf">door</span> behind me and live in it for a long time. </sentence><sentence id="97"><span class="building">Elementary school</span> was just around the corner. </sentence><sentence id="98">Uh... Well around the corner. </sentence><sentence id="99">It was in a part of the <span class="dlf">street</span> called, oddly enough, means beautiful <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="100">It wasn't nothing very beautiful about that <span class="dlf">street</span>, but the <span class="building">elementary school</span> was called at the time. </sentence><sentence id="101">And I remember the first...I was a person...uh...not very independent, probably as a result of the kind of education of the upbringing. </sentence><sentence id="102">As I said, I was over-protected, and...uh...it was difficult for me to separate myself from <span class="building">home</span> and go to <span class="building">school</span> in the first place. </sentence><sentence id="103">But...uh...I remember vividly on one of the first days, the principal of the <span class="building">school</span>, I remember the name of Pakoni lifted me on to his knee and I can see his friendly face. </sentence><sentence id="104">He was a person of Czech extraction, I believe. </sentence><sentence id="105">Uh...so he spoke a perfect German. </sentence><sentence id="106">I suspect that he might even have been born in <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>. </sentence><sentence id="107">But, of course, you know, the <span class="country">Austrian empire</span> at the time incorporated...uh... No, it had incorporated. </sentence><sentence id="108">At that time when I was born and <span class="populated place">Czechoslavakia</span> was already an independent <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="109">But before that it was part of the <span class="country">empire</span>. </sentence><sentence id="110">Uh...So he took me on his knee and he asked me whom I loved more, my mother or him. </sentence><sentence id="111">I was intensely embarrassed. </sentence><sentence id="112">I'm telling this story to show that...uh...uh... <span class="populated place">Vienna</span> was a place of mixed emotions for me. </sentence><sentence id="113">Anti-Semitism was endemic in <span class="populated place">Vienna</span> but there were loving persons, of course. </sentence><sentence id="114">There were individuals who and I did experience affection and love from some of them. </sentence><sentence id="115">As a matter of fact, when he asked me this question, the <span class="dlf">door</span> opened and Mother came in. ( </sentence><sentence id="116">Laughter) So that just adds to my embarrassment. ( </sentence><sentence id="117">Laughter) I don't know how I wiggled out of that one. </sentence><sentence id="118">Subsequently, we had a...a teacher by the name of Kanote. </sentence><sentence id="119">Uh...and...uh...she also singled me out as...uh...I guess I am...I am really sorry to say as one of her preferred students This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="120">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="121"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection because I don't like this whole business of really singling out anybody. </sentence><sentence id="122">I am today for instance Professor at <span class="building">Rutgers University</span> and...uh...1 am very much guided by...uh...maybe this experience and others that...uh...that I just like all my students. </sentence><sentence id="123">I like all the kids there. </sentence><sentence id="124">Uh...But in any case, she had...she had the Jewish pets and the Gentile pets. </sentence><sentence id="125">I was the Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="126">The Gentile was a fellow by the name of who is the son of policeman. </sentence><sentence id="127">I remember all these things so..so..so vividly. </sentence><sentence id="128">Uh...The reason I mention this again was to show you a little bit of the atmosphere there. </sentence><sentence id="129">Uh...And I remember one occasion when...uh...she would sometimes go out because I think that...uh...she had a bit of a flirt going with a...with another teacher by the name of Flashman in the class. </sentence><sentence id="130">And she asked me to monitor the class. </sentence><sentence id="131">And as soon as she left, the class broke out into some kind of rowdy behavior and I immediately was able somehow to control that and what I learned about myself instinctively, you know, and I only recall this on reflection now...was that in....in times of tension and so, I seemed to have...to...to psychologically understand ways of controlling myself, of being in...in complete possession of myself and consequently of the situation and it was something that stood me in good stead when the Nazis came in. </sentence><sentence id="132">Uh... </sentence></p></dialogue>
