<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7">Q: Where and when were you born? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9">A: I was born in <span class="populated place">Independence</span>, <span class="region">Wisconsin</span>, on March 25th, 1913. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="11">Q: Tell me a little bit about your childhood and your growing up, will you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="13">A: Well, I grew up in a small <span class="populated place">town</span> and then I went away to a small <span class="building">college</span> for | year and then I went to the <span class="building">University of Wisconsin</span> for 3 years. </sentence><sentence id="14">And when I came to the <span class="building">University of Wisconsin</span>, I ran onto a number of religious leaders who I got close to. </sentence><sentence id="15">There had been some anti-Semitic incidents on the <span class="building">campus</span> and I was asked if I would form a group to kind of neutralize this since I was on the basketball team and a few other things. </sentence><sentence id="16">So we formed a group called "KOINOS" from the Greek word, in common. </sentence><sentence id="17">And that group put on some seminars and we let it be known that we weren't going to have any more incidences around the <span class="building">campus</span> or some of us would respond in kind. </sentence><sentence id="18">And I became very interested through a number of professors in what was going on in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="19">And I wrote a thesis for Professor Selig Perlman on the nature and structure of German Fascism. </sentence><sentence id="20">I didn't know too much about it but I had a book by Professor Schuman at the <span class="building">University of Chicago</span> whereupon I applied to the <span class="building">University of Chicago</span> for a fellowship with Schuman which I was granted where my professors at the <span class="building">University</span> and Glenn Frank, the President of the <span class="building">University</span>, said if you can afford it, you should go abroad. </sentence><sentence id="21">So I said I can afford it, and I went abroad to the <span class="building">London School of Economics</span>, a part of the <span class="building">University of London</span>. </sentence><sentence id="22">And there I actually knew I wasn't going to stay 2 years so I could get a degree. </sentence><sentence id="23">Instead I did a lot of traveling and a lot of talking and a lot of writing as a young person who is having a whole new world opening to him. </sentence><sentence id="24">And then I was persuaded that my unruly mind needed some discipline. </sentence><sentence id="25">I should go to <span class="building">Harvard Law School</span>. </sentence><sentence id="26">So I came back to the <span class="country">States</span> and saw Professor Felix Frankfurter. </sentence><sentence id="27">He said I think you have the qualifications to be admitted, and I was admitted the next month to the <span class="building">Harvard Law School</span>. </sentence><sentence id="28">And while at the <span class="building">Law School</span> I didn't do too well except that I organized the <span class="building">Harvard Law School Union</span> and became its first president. </sentence><sentence id="29">And I became very active in working with campus groups getting speakers. </sentence><sentence id="30">I became a member of the <span class="building">Ford Hall</span> Youth Forum Directorate under David Niles, who was head of the <span class="building">Ford Hall Forum</span> in <span class="populated place">Boston</span>. </sentence><sentence id="31">And so there's the beginning. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="51">Q: You had told me earlier you went to <span class="country">Germany</span> in the early 30s. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="53">A: I went to <span class="country">Germany</span> first in about 1929 with my parents, as a part of a European trip of about 6 weeks. </sentence><sentence id="54">And we went to the <span class="building">Passion Play</span>, <span class="populated place">Oberamegau</span> and a few things in <span class="country">Germany</span>, but mainly we spent our time in <span class="country">England</span>, <span class="country">France</span>, and <span class="country">Switzerland</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="55">Q: And you went again in "35? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="56">A: Well, when I went...after I graduated from the <span class="building">University of Wisconsin</span>, I went to <span class="populated place">London</span> and to the <span class="building">London School of Economics</span> and to spend most of "34 and "35 over there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="58">Q: What did you see in <span class="country">Germany</span> at that time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="60">A: Well, in <span class="country">Germany</span> at that time, you didn't see too much on the surface except that the things were highly regimented. </sentence><sentence id="61">By the time I got to <span class="country">Germany</span>, the consolidation of power by the Nazis had well taken place. </sentence><sentence id="62">However, I did get there in time to have a big tour of the <span class="region">Ruhr</span>, because one of the German students, his father was the Director of the <span class="building">Gutehoffnungshuete</span> asked me to visit with their family and so on. </sentence><sentence id="63">And then I went into <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> for the Goering- Sonnemann wedding. </sentence><sentence id="64">He married...Goering married a movie actress by the name of Sonnemann, Emmy Sonnemann and I went and stood on the <span class="dlf">curb side</span> behind four rows of storm troopers and saw Hitler lead the parade and Goering down to the Dom, where he was married and back from the Dom and I took a picture upside down which I still have, which shows Hitler in the next <span class="spatial object">car</span> behind <span class="populated place">Goering</span> and <span class="populated place">Sonnemann</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="70">Q: As the war approached, you were in <span class="country">America</span>. </sentence><sentence id="71">You were finishing up <span class="building">law school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="72">What did you do? </sentence><sentence id="73">What kinds of things did you start getting involved in? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="78">A: Well, as soon as I was out of <span class="building">law school</span> in 1938 my <span class="building">law club</span> had won the Ames Competition which is the moot court arguments. </sentence><sentence id="79">And what we argued about was a case that was before the <span class="building">Supreme Court</span>, and so our briefs were used by the <span class="building">Department of Justice</span> as well as the National Labor Relations Board in the arguments before the <span class="building">Supreme Court</span>. </sentence><sentence id="80">And when I came down to <span class="populated place">Washington</span> looking for a job, I was...was interested in one of two jobs, either with the <span class="building">Labor Board</span> or with the <span class="building">Department of Justice Anti-Trust Division</span>. </sentence><sentence id="81">And I stopped at the <span class="building">Labor Board</span> first and I was hired in the first half hour, so I didn't go to the <span class="building">Department of Justice</span> for an interview. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="86">Q: How did...from the <span class="building">Labor Board</span>, how did you come involved in...as the war drew...drew closer in the war itself? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="88">A: Well, actually the work at the <span class="building">Labor Board</span> I was in the <span class="interior space">Trial Section</span> which I wanted to be in, and I was sent around the <span class="country">country</span> on first easier cases and then more difficult ones. </sentence><sentence id="89">And I got a lot of trial experience. </sentence><sentence id="90">And then I wound up finally in <span class="populated place">New York</span> at the time the war broke out. </sentence><sentence id="91">I enlisted and since I had been in <span class="country">England</span>, they shipped me right to <span class="country">England</span> as a Sergeant without any basic training or anything like that and assigned me to the Inspector General. </sentence><sentence id="92">Traveled all over <span class="country">England</span> and <span class="region">Northern Ireland</span> for up until after the invasion, the Allies invaded <span class="region">North Africa</span>. </sentence><sentence id="93">And then like a good Inspector General, I came down a month "German: <span class="building">Cathedral</span>. </sentence><sentence id="94">Referring in this instance specifically to the <span class="building">Cathedral</span> in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="95"> later and spent the next nearly the next year in <span class="region">North Africa</span> inspecting <span class="building">installations</span>. </sentence><sentence id="96">And from there, I worked into <span class="building">OSS</span>, which is another story. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="107">Q: Tell us a little bit because it is relevant...a little bit about what you did in <span class="building">OSS</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="109">A: Well, my...an old friend from the Labor Board was Gerhard Van Arkel, and he was one of the assistants of Arthur Goldberg, who was then a Major and the head of the German Labor Desk of OSS. </sentence><sentence id="110">And Van Arkel came down to <span class="populated place">Oran</span> which is my base in <span class="region">North Africa</span>, and tried to persuade me for some time to come with OSS as a training officer. </sentence><sentence id="111">Well, we finally worked it so that I could get there because I...my boss didn't want to let me go. </sentence><sentence id="112">And when I got to <span class="populated place">Algiers</span> and I worked with about 12 or 13 Germans who had fought in with the Loyalists in <span class="country">Spain</span> against the Dictator Franco, or the upcoming Dictator Franco, and of course, that helped solidify too my feelings and about things in <span class="country">Germany</span>, and gave me more information about how OSS operated. </sentence><sentence id="113">I met Wild Bill, General Wild Bill Donovan" at that time, but never knew him well. </sentence><sentence id="114">And at a certain point Arthur Goldberg asked me to come back and be the Director of Training for the <span class="building">German-Labor Desk</span> in <span class="populated place">Washington</span>. </sentence><sentence id="115">I did that and when the...looked like the war was winding down a good deal, I moved over to the <span class="building">Labor Branch</span> of the <span class="building">Department of the Army</span> because there were tremendous manpower shortages in various industries: aluminum, forge and foundry work, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="116">And while I was working on that along came VE Day and Justice Jackson, meanwhile, had been appointed Chief of Counsel for the <span class="country">United States</span>* and I came back into <span class="populated place">Washington</span> and he made his first report to President Truman. </sentence><sentence id="117">I was terribly impressed by what he'd...what he reported on and I made up my mind that somehow I was going to get on Justice Jackson's staff. </sentence><sentence id="118">I didn't know Justice Jackson, but I did know David K. Niles, who was an assistant to the President, and he sent a ...a letter recommending me to Justice Jackson, but nothing ever. </sentence><sentence id="119">Meanwhile, I thought that might be the case, so I went back to <span class="building">OSS</span>, to the <span class="building">General Counsel's office</span>", and told him that I would like to work on the trials, and he told me that OSS was actually furnishing most of the data for Justice Jackson because the <span class="building">Department of Justice</span> had very little and our <span class="building">War Department</span> had very little. </sentence><sentence id="120">And he said, "But in our <span class="spatial object">files</span>, the research and analysis here, we have something about practically everything that's happened in <span class="country">Nazi Germany</span>." </sentence><sentence id="121">I said, "Fine." </sentence><sentence id="122">And so for the next month or so, I just studied those <span class="spatial object">files</span> like a trooper. </sentence><sentence id="123">A professor by the name of Franz Neumann wrote a book called Behemoth", was there and he gave me some tips on different things to do and when he found out I was interested in the Trade Union Movement, he gave me a book in which the Nazis bragged *The Head of OSS. </sentence><sentence id="124">Information supplied by interviewee. * </sentence><sentence id="125">Justice Robert Jackson was appointed represent the <span class="country">United States</span> as U.S. Chief of Counsel for the <span class="building">War Crimes Tribunal</span>. ( </sentence><sentence id="126">Information supplied by interviewee.) " </sentence><sentence id="127">Commander James Donovan. ( </sentence><sentence id="128">Information supplied by interviewee). " </sentence><sentence id="129">The full title is <span class="building">Behemoth</span>: The Structure and Practice of National Socialism. </sentence><sentence id="130">Information supplied by interviewee. </sentence><sentence id="131"> about how they'd taken over the <span class="building">trade unions</span>. </sentence><sentence id="132">And they included the...a copy of the order in the appendix that they'd sent out to the SA...the storm troops in order to seize these trade union leaders and the <span class="building">headquarters</span> of all the unions on the 2nd of May 1933. </sentence><sentence id="133">Well, this gave me a tremendous basis for beginning to write a brief, which I did, and submitted it to several people, including <span class="populated place">Jackson</span>. </sentence><sentence id="134">And they were quite impressed that I had gotten this much...this kind of material without even getting into <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="135">So that's how I got started. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="164">Q: Why don't you pick it up from there and tell us about indeed going to <span class="country">Germany</span> and beginning the first research in the first work before the trials? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="166">A: I flew to <span class="populated place">London</span> in July of 1939 -- I'm sorry, 1945, and met some of the staff. </sentence><sentence id="167">And I could tell that a lot of them had gotten so accustomed to being in <span class="populated place">London</span> that they weren't anxious to go to <span class="populated place">Paris</span> and <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="168">But Colonel Storey(r), the head of the Documentation Division, had already established <span class="building">shop</span> in <span class="populated place">Paris</span>. </sentence><sentence id="169">And I tried...I persuaded them to let me get there as soon as possible. </sentence><sentence id="170">When I got to <span class="populated place">Paris</span> in July of 1945, the Rosenberg files had just been brought into <span class="dlf">Rue de Pressbourg</span> which was the headquarters of the <span class="building">OSS office</span> there and now became the head of the <span class="building">Chief of Counsel War Crimes office</span>." </sentence><sentence id="171">So here I saw all these volumes. </sentence><sentence id="172">Some of them had still had hay sticking out of them or straw. </sentence><sentence id="173">Uh...Rosenberg had buried these files behind a <span class="dlf">double wall</span>, but some German had seen him do it and reported it to an Allied officer, an American officer and the American officer told us, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="174">So they were brought in there. </sentence><sentence id="175">There were few people to work on those <span class="spatial object">files</span>. </sentence><sentence id="176">And Colonel Storey didn't speak any German and he had gotten from the <span class="building">American Embassy</span> and so on, a few people who are...spoke German, and they'd begun. </sentence><sentence id="177">But he said out of the Rosenberg, what they producing out of the <span class="spatial object">Rosenberg files</span> is a tremendous number...amount of materials on slave labor and spoilation and the stealing of art treasures and all this kind of thing, but they haven't produced anything that directly ties them to aggressive war. </sentence><sentence id="178">I wish you'd tackle that. </sentence><sentence id="179">So that was my first day in <span class="populated place">Paris</span>. </sentence><sentence id="180">And that night after dinner, I came back and gazed at this <span class="spatial object">files</span>. </sentence><sentence id="181">And they were all thick Leitz Omers(r) about 3 inches thick, except one which was about an inch thick or so. </sentence><sentence id="182">And that had on the back of it Norwegen APA--<span class="country">Norway</span>, <span class="building">Foreign Political Office</span>, <span class="building">Auslandspolitischesamt</span>, and I just figured that was easier to tackle than any big volume. </sentence><sentence id="183">So I pulled it down. </sentence><sentence id="184">And I started to think. </sentence><sentence id="185">Now, let's see, there was a <span class="building">Quisling</span>. </sentence><sentence id="186">And Vidkun Quisling, and he became a collaborator. </sentence><sentence id="187">Let's see when was <span class="country">Norway</span> invaded?June 1940. </sentence><sentence id="188">So I went to that period in this file, and I looked before it and here there was memos about Vidkun Quisling bringing 12 Germans in to see Rosenberg in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> and eventually Quisling had been introduced to Hitler in a brief conversation and that then you go in <span class="interior space">back</span> and had helped in the invasion...the Nazi invasion of <span class="country">Norway</span>. </sentence><sentence id="189">I immediately went degColonel Robert G. Storey. ( </sentence><sentence id="190">Information supplied by interviewee).TRue de Pressbourg was converted into the <span class="building">Paris branch office</span> for the U.S. Chief of Council for War Crimes. </sentence><sentence id="191">Information supplied by the interviewee. ( </sentence><sentence id="192">r)Notebooks. ( </sentence><sentence id="193">Information supplied by interviewee.) </sentence><sentence id="194"> in to Story the next morning and told him, "Here's what I've got." </sentence><sentence id="195">And I had already written a very brief one-page memo on this. </sentence><sentence id="196">And I said, "Now my German isn't very good, so I'm not going to be able to vouch for all these, but I think you might just take this file to <span class="populated place">London</span>." </sentence><sentence id="197">He was going to <span class="populated place">London</span> the next day on Justice Jackson's <span class="spatial object">private plane</span> or the <span class="spatial object">plane</span> that the Amny had assigned him. </sentence><sentence id="198">He took that file back to <span class="populated place">London</span> and, of course, immediately it was on the top of the <span class="spatial object">desks</span> of everybody with respect to what had been found. </sentence><sentence id="199">And this is how I made my first impression on <span class="populated place">Jackson</span>. </sentence><sentence id="200">And then I also showed him this brief that I had done and told him that it needed filling in as soon as I could get into <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="201">And he said, "Well, I think we better hurry you along." </sentence><sentence id="202">So, well, meanwhile I had gone into <span class="country">Germany</span>, but I hadn't gone to <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span> because we didn't know that <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span> was going to be the head of the trials in July. </sentence><sentence id="203">But I had gone in and made a few contacts and knew that some contacts that would be helpful. </sentence><sentence id="204">On August 15th, by that time the <span class="populated place">London</span> agreement had been signed establishing the <span class="building">Tribunal</span> and Office Chief of War Crimes as the main representative of the American...the Americans and so on. </sentence><sentence id="205">And then Major Baldwin, who is Colonel Storey's deputy, and I flew in in order to open the <span class="building">office</span> in <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="206">And we came into this bombed and shelled, huge <span class="building">Palace of Justice</span> as it was called out on the <span class="dlf">Fuertherstrasse</span>, and the first thing we had to do is the <span class="dlf">windows</span> had been broken in from shelling and bombing. </sentence><sentence id="207">The <span class="building">building</span> itself was only had been hit in a couple of places. </sentence><sentence id="208">It wasn't too badly full of debris except in one or two places. </sentence><sentence id="209">But the <span class="dlf">windows</span> had come in and the <span class="interior space">floors</span> were all dirty, and there was dust on the <span class="spatial object">tables</span> and so on. </sentence><sentence id="210">And what I did was get a bunch of SS men from a nearby <span class="building">incarceration spot</span> or <span class="building">detention center</span> and we used these OSS men in order to clean up the <span class="building">Palace of Justice</span>, in order to make <span class="interior space">room</span> for the trials. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="260">Q: When did you start begin...to begin the interrogations and the preparations for the trials? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="262">How did that begin? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="263">A: Well, I began preparations for the trial back in the <span class="country">States</span> because of the materials that OSS had. </sentence><sentence id="264">And that would have been in...in June of 1945. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="267">Q: But here in <span class="country">Germany</span>? </sentence><sentence id="268">By the time you got to <span class="country">Germany</span>, you were doing what now? </sentence><sentence id="269">You had opened this <span class="building">office</span>. </sentence><sentence id="270">What were you doing there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="275">A: Well, by the time I got to <span class="country">Germany</span> I already had connections to a lot of the heads of trade unions who had been put in <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span> early in the war, or early in the Nazi regime. </sentence><sentence id="276">And I started traveling around in order to get affidavits from them. </sentence><sentence id="277">And in the process of getting that, I also got materials covering Gypsies and Jews to some extent, although that wasn't my <span class="dlf">field</span>, main <span class="dlf">field</span> of operations. </sentence><sentence id="278">And then I started and when we got we got to <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span>, some more people came in and I was assigned a German refugee by the name of Norbert Heilpern He spoke very good German and a broken English, but he was...and incidently, he'd been a soldier in World War I on the <span class="region">German side</span>, and so it was often interesting and he'd often put on a little act for us at parties we had where he'd play the Prussian soldier. </sentence><sentence id="279">But with his help, I managed to get the idea behind many documents which were later introduced in the trials. </sentence><sentence id="280">And I could make a case that they ought to be translated by experts in the <span class="region">language division</span>. </sentence><sentence id="281">And from that I...I built a brief on the destruction of the  trade unions and the building of the German Labor Front by the defendant Ley. </sentence><sentence id="282">And I...it was pretty well understood that I was going to prosecute Robert Ley, the head of the German Labor Front, whereupon he committed suicide upon his indictment, which ended my first defendant. </sentence><sentence id="283">And then we were looking around for somebody to prepare the case on Hans Fritzsche. </sentence><sentence id="284">He...he was head of the <span class="building">Radio Division</span> of Goebbels" <span class="building">Propaganda Ministry</span>, and who broadcasts once a week under the title of "Hans Fritsche Spricht", "Hans Fritzsche Speaks." </sentence><sentence id="285">And this was broadcast to the German people every week. </sentence><sentence id="286">And he engaged in a tremendous amount of inflammatory propaganda against the Bolshevistic Jewish Imperialistic Capitalistic Interveners in <span class="country">Germany</span>'s private affairs and so on. </sentence><sentence id="287">And we didn't have...we couldn't find his the originals of his speeches, or the copies of his speeches. </sentence><sentence id="288">All we had were the translations which the British Broadcasting Company had made and then they'd destroyed the tapes, unfortunately, because the they needed the records for further interceptions that they were doing. </sentence><sentence id="289">They were short of records apparently. </sentence><sentence id="290">So what we had to do is translate from the English back to the German these materials and present them to <span class="populated place">Fritzsche</span> in <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="291">And actually he took very little exception to them. </sentence><sentence id="292">In a couple of cases, he changed a word or two. </sentence><sentence id="293">But his lawyer, Dr. Fritz strange because he was represented <span class="populated place">Fritzche</span>. </sentence><sentence id="294">Dr. Fritz and I got to be fairly collegial in our relationships, and I submitted a proposed outline of...in which Fritzche would indicate all of his connections to the Nazi party that he was willing to talk about, which he did. </sentence><sentence id="295">And it was...we figured that this was as good a way as to get out as the last man in the <span class="dlf">dock</span> as any way. </sentence><sentence id="296">So he submitted this and it enabled me to write a fairly decent brief on him and also the people working on propaganda generally were appreciative of these materials. </sentence><sentence id="297">And about that time Colonel Storey said to me, "I think we owe you something other than trying <span class="populated place">Fritzsche</span>. </sentence><sentence id="298">How would you like to work on the case against Baldur von Schirach, the Hitler Youth Leader, and later Gauleiter of <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>. </sentence><sentence id="299">And I said, "Fine." </sentence><sentence id="300">So that was my second assignment, was that. </sentence><sentence id="301">Both of those...the preparation of both of those cases led to my being able to present the case against those two defendants to the <span class="building">International Military Tribunal</span>. </sentence><sentence id="302">One in January and one in February of 1946. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="333">A: Well, Fritzsche attempted to play the role of the student I think. </sentence><sentence id="334">He'd been a radio commentator under the <span class="country">Weimar Republic</span> for a conservative bunch of publications and who also owned some <span class="building">radio stations</span> in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="335">And Goebbels had liked his work and as soon as the Nazi's came to power, Goebbels called him in for an interview and told him that he wanted to give him a high position in the <span class="building">Propaganda Ministry</span>. </sentence><sentence id="336">So he was made the head of the division dealing with the press, the <span class="building">German Press Division</span>. </sentence><sentence id="337">And although he got his instructions from Goebbels and from Otto Dietrich whom we later tried in <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span> and did convict...Fritzsche repeated this garbage that he was given before the preparation of each of the wars, although he was never a party to any of the planning. </sentence><sentence id="338">But he would repeat what he was told. </sentence><sentence id="339">And I thought this would be ample to indict him...to convict him on Count One, on the conspiracy count. </sentence><sentence id="340">He wasn't convicted on that Count at all. </sentence><sentence id="341">But in the process of this, we got a lot of materials that were quite useful. </sentence><sentence id="342">And you were asking what kind of fellow Fritzsche was, he was a very good speaker...had a very good voice. </sentence><sentence id="343">And he was well liked by  a lot of ordinary Germans because of his manner on the...on the <span class="spatial object">radio</span>. </sentence><sentence id="344">He was rather disliked by some of the party people because he hadn't become a party member until after Hitler came to power. </sentence><sentence id="345">And a number of them had ambitions to the mainly radio people, and, of course, Fritzsche stole the show on them. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="365">A: The <span class="interior space">court room</span> was on the <span class="region">east side</span> of the huge <span class="building">Palace of

</sentence><sentence id="368">But this separate <span class="building">building</span> in which is connected by a small <span class="dlf">passageway</span> was the place where the Trials were going to be held. </sentence><sentence id="369">An architect whose name I forget now, who worked for OSS, was pushed in very early and he immediately came up with the design and it required knocking out some <span class="dlf">walls</span> and to make the <span class="interior space">court room</span> larger so there'd be <span class="interior space">room</span> for the press and for visitors. </sentence><sentence id="370">And he did a terrific job on this, and also made <span class="interior space">cubicles</span> for the <span class="spatial object">photographic apparatus</span> that would be used and for the <span class="spatial object">sound equipment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="371">Every bit of the Trial was recorded on tape, so that there could never be any argument about what was said and also it helped the interpreters when they went back to check whether ...whether they'd interpreted quite accurately or not. </sentence><sentence id="372">It helped them a great deal to have this recording. </sentence><sentence id="373">The <span class="interior space">court room</span>...as you entered the <span class="interior space">court room</span> through the main <span

</sentence><sentence id="374">And at the back of the <span class="dlf">dock</span>, there was an <span class="spatial object">elevator</span> that went down four" floors to the <span class="interior

wouldn't get wet in case it was raining. </sentence><sentence id="375">Immediately beside the...the prisoners" <span class="dlf">dock</span> was the <span class="interior space">interpreting section</span> which had about eight interpreters in it. </sentence><sentence id="376">And that was walled in by glass. </sentence><sentence id="377">And behind it there was this simultaneous interpretation equipment whereby if a person were speaking in German...that would be on <span class="dlf">Channel 1</span>. </sentence><sentence id="378"><span class="dlf">Channel</span>...we had a <span class="spatial object">simultaneous interpreting system</span> which is...I should go into perhaps. </sentence><sentence id="379">But <span class="dlf">Channel</span> | was always a voice being spoken either in the <span class="dlf">dock</span> or wherever. </sentence><sentence id="380">And the interpreters would get this voice and translate it into the other three languages. </sentence><sentence id="381">If English were being spoken, it would be translated into German, French and Russian, and if Russian were being spoken, it would be translated into the other three languages, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="382">And these were very key people, and they were very good. </sentence><sentence id="383">A man by the name of Colonel Doscert, <span class="building">D-O-S-C-E-R-T</span> had recruited the initial interpreters and helped train them in using this simultaneous translation equipment, which was very new. </sentence><sentence id="384">It had never been used before except for the <span class="building">International Labor Office</span>...I think, in <span class="populated place">Geneva</span> had tested it out. </sentence><sentence id="385">But when the...when IBM heard that there was going to a four-power trial, they sent someone in to see my friend, Charlie Horsky, from the firm of <span class="populated

impressed by it because during the...the negotiations for the <span class="populated place">London</span> agreement, which was signed on August 8, 1945, they'd had to have interpreters in there translating from the American to the French to the Russian and so on. </sentence><sentence id="388">And it had been...slowed down the process very much, whereas if you had simultaneous translation, you could speed up the process by at least one half, by at least one-half. </sentence><sentence id="389">Well, to get back to the <span class="building">courtroom</span>, after you got past the interpreters, went around, you came to the <span class="interior space">witness box</span> on the, also on the east side of the <span class="building">courtroom</span>. </sentence><sentence id="390">Then on the <span class="region">south side</span> of the <span class="building">courtroom</span>, there was a huge <span class="spatial object">bench</span> which had been built and behind that sat the eight judges, the four principal judges and their four...four alternates. </sentence><sentence id="391">Incidentally, in the construction of that <span class="spatial

the alternate American judge, saw that, he immediately screamed and, of course, Judge Biddle"", the American judge took it up with the American authorities, and they immediately corrected that

any instructions the judges had or do any errands that the judges had and who would fetch witnesses and things like that. </sentence><sentence id="395">Then coming around a little bit further was the

were five <span class="spatial object">tables</span>, each of which sat about 10 people. </sentence><sentence id="398">Four of them were assigned to the...the prosecution, one to each of the

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="438">Q: What kind of pressures were on you as you began your prosecution of this trial? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="440">A: The principal pressures that were on us were the pressures created by language, too few translators and an awful lot of prosecutors and judges who didn't understand the German language at all. </sentence><sentence id="441">So this slowed us down a great deal, and the fact that I knew a little German...I'd had 3 and a half years at the <span class="building">University of Wisconsin</span>, and I'd traveled over there a little bit...helped me a great deal and so I was able to help other attorneys and make suggestions to them as to how they can move a long a little bit faster. </sentence><sentence id="442">There was hardly any of the trial counsel who later appeared in <span class="building">court</span>, for the Americans, who spoke German, hudge John Parker.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="459">A: Well, the first defendant I prosecuted was Baldur von Schirach, actually, although I'd begun to make preparations on the Fritzsche case first. </sentence><sentence id="460">But since Fritzsche was the last man on the <span class="dlf">dock</span>, he was also the last person about whom we made a presentation to the <span class="building">Tribunal</span>. </sentence><sentence id="461">Baldur von Schirach was in the second row of the <span class="dlf">dock</span>, but about the third man in. </sentence><sentence id="462">And so, a case against him was made a couple of weeks before the case on <span class="populated place">Fritzsche</span> was made. </sentence><sentence id="463">And we were told, as we prepared our briefs, we were told to try to shorten them up a bit so we wouldn't take too much time. </sentence><sentence id="464">And most of us managed to get our presentations in in 2 hours against the individual defendants. </sentence><sentence id="465">Now before that, a tremendous amount of material had been put in about the development of the Nazi regime, about each of the invasions, about the War Crimes, and Crimes against Humanities practiced against had applications to civilians in <span class="country">Germany</span> as well as outside <span class="country">Germany</span> in the <span class="region">occupied countries</span>, the slave labor, the Jews, the Gypsies, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="466">Actually, there was no presentation on Gypsies separately, which I think was a great mistake, and I have developed a chapter on that for my book which I'll bring you next time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="475">Q: Can you tell us...actually before we go into the von Schirach prosecution, something of the controversy as you were involved in it or if you were involved in... particularly on the Crimes against Humanity charge and the whole question of the Jews? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="477">A: Well, the...the <span class="building">Count One</span>, the conspiracy to wage aggressive war, was alleged in very broad terms. </sentence><sentence id="478">Uh...Justice Jackson had this notion that the conspiracy reached way back even to the times of the <span class="populated place">Munich</span> Putsch when Hitler formed the party program and so on. </sentence><sentence id="479">Now, of course, a lot of the defendants didn't become attached anything having to do with Hitler until sometime later. </sentence><sentence id="480">And we had the idea that under the Master Race doctrine, the Nazis had seized power, they had consolidated power. </sentence><sentence id="481">They had persecuted first Germans and then they'd persecuted Jews within <span class="country">Germany</span>, and Gypsies. </sentence><sentence id="482">And then, of course, they'd marched into <span class="country">Austria</span> and <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> where they really stepped up the persecution of minority people and particularly the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="483">And then after the war began, the invasion of <span class="country">Poland</span> and the press was sent <span class="building">home</span>, you might say, and there was a real iron curtain established. </sentence><sentence id="484">That is when Hitler really began to let loose with his doctrines of evacuating and eventually exterminating the Jewish people, Gypsies, even talked about Poles and Slavs as being of an inferior race that ought be cut down and their numbers used as slaves to the master race. </sentence><sentence id="485">After the invasion of <span class="country">Poland</span> in September 1939, Hitler held a conference in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> which was attended by a quite a number of people, including the head of the Abwehr, the counterintelligence who was actually never very much for Hitler, and later on turned against him, and was executed after the attempt on Hitler's life in "44. </sentence><sentence id="486">But he came out of that first meeting that Hitler had after the conquest of <span class="country">Poland</span> and told a witness that we had about how Hitler had said that when we go into <span class="country">Poland</span>, we don't come in order to establish a very efficient government and to please the Polish people and the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="487">We came to put them in  0 their place, etc. </sentence><sentence id="488">And he spoke of...at that point, of exterminating Jews and evacuating them and so on. </sentence><sentence id="489">And actually, of course, the tremendous number of Poles and Jews were exterminated just after that campaign. </sentence><sentence id="490">But the...the main exterminations, of course, didn't take place until the invasion of <span class="country">Russia</span> when you had the so-called Eintsatzgruppen of Himmler. </sentence><sentence id="491">The SS sent in four different uh..battle groups to follow behind the invading Germans and to liquidate all the people they considered enemies, and these, of course, were particularly Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="492">And altogether, my guess would be that a million people were executed well before the Wannsee Conference of January 1942, which a lot of people take as being the kind of the beginning of the Final Solution. </sentence><sentence id="493">In my opinion, that's entirely wrong. </sentence><sentence id="494">That <span class="populated place">Wannsee Conference</span> actually brought in more <span class="building">departments</span>, the <span class="building">economics department</span> and a lot of others that hadn't been directly involved in any great extent and...and indicated to them that this Solution was going on and that they were expected to be a part of it, and that this meant there was a lot of assets that could be absorbed, etcetera., </sentence><sentence id="495">etcetera. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="515">Q: How was this case developed during the trial? </sentence><sentence id="516">How did the lawyers for the prosecution develop the case against the case to prove that there had been a deliberate plot to exterminate the Jews? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="519">A: Well, there was a whole group...I think it was first under a Major Walsh"", which worked on this subject in <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span> and long before actually, OSS people had worked on developing papers on what was happening to the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="520">But Major Walsh had this team. ( </sentence><sentence id="521"><span class="dlf">Clearing Throat</span>) And when they came...when we came into <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span>, we found that the <span class="building">offices</span> of the...Julius Streicher, the main Jew-baiter of all time, were reasonably well intact and that and we captured a full set of the <span class="spatial object">Stiirmer</span>, the <span class="spatial object">Stormer</span>, which was his official publication. </sentence><sentence id="522">Now some copies of that, of course, had been available before hand outside of <span class="country">Germany</span> and had been kept and in some cases they hadn't. </sentence><sentence id="523">But this now offered a tremendous well of additional information. </sentence><sentence id="524">And the case against Streicher was relatively weak because we couldn't prove that he knew about the extermination of the Jews until some information came in the war through the <span class="building">Stiirmer</span>, that he was talking about the <span class="building">Israelitische Wochenblatt</span>, a weekly published by Jews in <span class="country">Switzerland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="525">And in there, the editors of this <span class="building">newspaper</span> had said some history about the extermination of the Jews, and Streicher in the Sturmer published some of this and underneath, it said, "This is no Goddamn Jewish lie." </sentence><sentence id="526">And so that is what when we found that out, we had some additional materials. </sentence><sentence id="527">And that was not used until his cross examination by the British, and it was used very effectively. </sentence><sentence id="528">And got him into a real bind and made him obviously appear to be...having lied all the way through. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="539">Q: Tell us more about the cases in which you were directly involved during this first trial? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="541">A: When I was assigned to work on the case of Baldur von Schirach, the Youth... Youth Leader, another attorney and some other and some of his people helping him, Major Hartley Murray had developed considerable amount of materials on the Hitler Youth and on Baldur von Maj or William F. Walsh, Assistant Trial Counsel, <span class="country">U.S.A.</span> Information supplied by interviewee. </sentence><sentence id="542"> 1 <span class="populated place">Schirach</span>. </sentence><sentence id="543">And really Major Hartley Murray should have been assigned that case, but I think they somehow wanted to throw me an easier case than the Schirach"* case and so I was assigned to it. </sentence><sentence id="544">Baldur von Schirach had formed a Nazi group or the youth group about 1925 or so when he was himself in...in <span class="building">college</span>. </sentence><sentence id="545">And Hitler heard about it and asked him to come for an interview, and Hitler made him the Hitler Youth Leader. </sentence><sentence id="546">Also Hitler's main photographer, Heinrich Hoffmann, had a daughter by the name of Henrietta, and Hitler introduced Schirach to Henrietta Hoffmann and they began...they were married. </sentence><sentence id="547">So that was another thing which brought Hitler...<span class="populated place">Schirach</span> into fairly close proximity to...to Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="548">He developed the Hitler Youth before Hitler came to power to a very substantial group. </sentence><sentence id="549">And they got songwriters to write some marching songs for them and it became a group which was put into the parades that the Nazis put on in <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span> every November to celebrate the Nazi Putsch of 1923. </sentence><sentence id="550">And <span class="populated place">Schirach</span> was more and more brought to the fore in connection with these things. </sentence><sentence id="551">As soon as Hitler...as the Nazis came to power, Hitler appointed Schirach to be the National Youth Leader and he was given such power that he was able to destroy the youth organizations of the opposition which were fairly strong actually. </sentence><sentence id="552">And finally, he even took over the <span class="building">Catholic youth organizations</span> and forced them into the <span class="building">Hitler Youth</span>. </sentence><sentence id="553">After more indoctrination of various kinds and so on, he made agreements with Htler...or with Himmler, the head of the SS, that some of the Youth members, Hitler Youth members who had shown great promise would be put directly into the SS. </sentence><sentence id="554">And also he made an arrangement with the head of the Armed Forces that Hitler youth would get some preferences about indoctrination into the Armed Forces. </sentence><sentence id="555">So he was well involved in connection with having polluted the mind of young people. </sentence><sentence id="556">When the war came along, he continued in this work until Hitler called him down to (clearing throat) <span class="populated place">Berchtesgaden</span> one time and told him that he wanted him to become the Gauleiter of <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>...that he wasn't...hadn't been satisfied with the earlier leadership in <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>, and he had alienated an awful lot of Austrians and wouldn't he accept that position. </sentence><sentence id="557">Of course, a request from Hitler is like a demand and Von Schirach went and became the Gauleiter and the rank governor of <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>. </sentence><sentence id="558">Actually, by the time... uh...Schirach got that position, most of the Jews had already been pushed out of uh <span class="populated place">Vienna</span> and there probably weren't...in a <span class="populated place">city</span> which had a half a million Jews, there probably weren't more than a couple of hundred thousand left at that time. </sentence><sentence id="559">But Schirach had the idea of having a Youth conference of the youth...of leaders of youth from various <span class="country">occupied countries</span> in September of 1942. </sentence><sentence id="560">And while addressing them, he said, "If I have sent thousands upon thousands of Jews into the <span class="populated place">ghettos</span> of the <span class="region">east</span>, then I consider it a contribution to European civilization." </sentence><sentence id="561">Now that speech was published the next day in the <span class="building">Voelkische Beobachter</span>, which is the official Nazi paper in in <span class="country">Austria</span>, as well as in in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="562">And, of course that was used very early in the briefs that Hartley Murray and others had prepared. </sentence><sentence id="563">And it is what I use as my perovation, my last words, in making the case against <span class="populated place">von Schirach</span>. </sentence><sentence id="564">I said, "And in closing, your Honors,"...and then I just repeated those words that he had stated. </sentence><sentence id="565">I was very surprised that he didn't get a sentence of more than 20 years because he had done a lot of things, but I think one of the reasons was his behavior in <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span> during the trial. </sentence><sentence id="566">He became very open and he made releases to the press, and Correction of Interviewee: Fritzsche. </sentence><sentence id="567"> 2 he indicated that Hitler had betrayed the German people and he'd betrayed him. </sentence><sentence id="568">And that he wanted to make amends, as far as he could, although he realized that was not possible and so on. </sentence><sentence id="569">And I think this influenced the <span class="building">Tribunal</span> to some extent. </sentence><sentence

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="613">Q: Mr. Sprecher, could you talk somewhat, please, about how a case was developed and what it was like to have to bring a case then to trial? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="615">A: In the first place, the case was largely developed...uh...on a subject by subject basis to begin with. </sentence><sentence id="616">And it was only later that it was broken down to be directed against individual defendants. </sentence><sentence id="617">So for example, when we got to <span class="populated place">London</span>, in July and August, a large number of German documents had been found. </sentence><sentence id="618"><span class="building">British Foreign Office</span> documents and the Rosenberg files that I mentioned before and a group that was working on...for instance, the (clearing throat) occupation of <span class="country">Austria</span> in March of 1938, they would have gone back into these files and dug up documents that had to do with that. </sentence><sentence id="619">They would have gotten keys to newspaper articles about it. </sentence><sentence id="620">The Austrian case, of course, was rather out in the open because that was a case of marching in. </sentence><sentence id="621">But on the other hand, what happened at the conference where Schuschnigg, the Chancellor of <span class="country">Austria</span>, was brought into the <span class="populated place">Berchtesgaden</span> and a lot of pressure applied to him, that we wouldn't have known about until we got a summary that had been made by someone who was present, a German assistant to Hitler, one of his adjutants or someone else who made a summary of the conference, and how the pressure was put on or...Now we did have interrogations made during this preliminary period of all, not only of the prospective defendants, but other people about how things had happened. </sentence><sentence id="622">I observed a lot of those interrogations in <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="623">But we never...we seldom used that interrogation material in the actual trial because we had better materials by that time. </sentence><sentence id="624">Now in a few cases, they did in order to confront witnesses on cross examinations. " </sentence><sentence id="625">Now during your preliminary interrogations you did or you didn't admit this. </sentence><sentence id="626">Why didn't you admit it? </sentence><sentence id="627">Or didn't you say something different? </sentence><sentence id="628">Uh...That gave us quite an advantage which you often don't have where the defendant, prospective defendant can claim the right against self- incrimination. </sentence><sentence id="629">Now, we were charged into the Charter"*...the prosecution of this charter, with the obligation of interrogating possible defendants before they were interrogated...before they were indicted. </sentence><sentence id="630">So there's...there's a little different approach there than there would be an Anglo-Saxon law. </sentence><sentence id="631">Uh...So there's a whole group that was working on the various aggressive war charges, the invasion of <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> and the invasion of <span class="country">Poland</span> and so on. </sentence><sentence id="632">And with their research analysts these lawyers would scan documents and the research analysts would write what was called the Staff Evidence Analysis, an <span class="region">SEA</span>. </sentence><sentence id="633">And at the top of that it would give the name of the document or what the document was about, what defendants were mentioned in the document what other leading Germans were mentioned in the document...before it even went into what was shown by the document. </sentence><sentence id="634">And then there would be a brief analysis in there as to what the document showed. </sentence><sentence id="635">Now at this point the document had not been translated so that anybody in English could read it. </sentence><sentence id="636">These were German-speaking research analysts, most of them refugees from the Nazi regime who were given briefings as to what we were looking for, and then they would go into the documents and they would write these <span class="env feature">SEAs</span> and they would come to mostly English speaking lawyers and English speaking "4The Charter of the <span class="building">International Military Tribunal</span>. </sentence><sentence id="637">Information supplied by interviewee. </sentence><sentence id="638"> 4 lawyers say, "That's good. </sentence><sentence id="639">That doesn't belong" to anything," and so on. </sentence><sentence id="640">And then they would...we would either have a good document translated or we would say, "Look, see if you can find some other documents around that document that bear on the same subject which are even more telling in their...of...in the proof they give." </sentence><sentence id="641">So we had these various kind of subteams of the prosecution team who worked on these things, and actually the British and the Americans mixed some of the teams so we had on some of the teams Peter Calvocoressi who is a British commander, wrote a book"(r) on the Nuremberg trials later. </sentence><sentence id="642">He was...he worked with Telford Taylor in <span class="country">England</span> in counterintelligence during the end of the war, and he came right over to <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span> when Taylor came over. </sentence><sentence id="643">So we had some...some very close collaboration there. </sentence><sentence id="644">The staff tended to divide between those who were working on aggressive war, those who were working on the maltreatment of people in the <span class="region">occupied countries</span>, including...and then we had a separate group working on the persecution of the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="645">But they worked very close together with the group working on the total mistreatment of civilians and minorities in the...well, majorities in the case of the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span>" in the...the <span class="country">occupied countries</span>. </sentence><sentence id="646">Now the Germans were tremendous document keepers and very few documents were destroyed. </sentence><sentence id="647">Orders were made to destroy the documents in the <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span> themselves, but in some cases this wasn't even done, or in some cases the Russians advanced so quickly that they...they still found lists of people who had been exterminated or some of the documents about the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> after they'd occupied it. </sentence><sentence id="648">And there is a death book, I think from <span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span>, which used to be...which was...I've seen it not only over there, but I saw it in the <span class="building">archives</span> and I think it's now been taken out to __*(r) You might want to see it sometime. </sentence><sentence id="649">But in one of the <span class="populated place">camps</span> you have a listing of people who were killed each day, and this was partly kept by a Kapo, a Kapo, a...one of the prisoners, one of the inmates of the <span class="populated place">camp</span> himself. </sentence><sentence id="650">And using a certain amount of imagination, he listed the name and the number of the inmate and under cause of death he put each case "Herzschlag"-- heart...heart attack. </sentence><sentence id="651">So here you have...and then what he did was enter | every minute throughout the day or if that...more people had been killed than that, he'd enter a number at this point. </sentence><sentence id="652">But he did everything kind of alphabetically and to the extent he could and in these groups of these time groupings, so that anybody who got this book could tell that something was going on besides people just dying of natural causes. </sentence><sentence id="653">And that book you might be interested in getting hold of. .

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="720">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="721">So tell us more now about...you're building a case. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="724">A: Well, all these Staff Evidence Analysis were passed to all the lawyers and we all read them and so we had a general idea what is happening. </sentence><sentence id="725">Then a very important person at <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span>, Commander Whitney Harris, who wrote the Tyranny on Trial, is a good friend of mine. </sentence><sentence id="726">He and I decided that we ought to organize some briefings at night of all the prosecutors just generally about what was the nature of the Nazi regime and what was developing in these various study groups. </sentence><sentence id="727">And so we held... up until the time that indictments were going to be issued, we must have held about 18 of this nightly meetings. </sentence><sentence id="728">We didn't hold them every night, but maybe two a week, something like that. </sentence><sentence id="729">And for instance, I presented an organized presentation on the "Fuehrerprinzip", the leadership principal. </sentence><sentence id="730">How in the Nazi party, theoretically, you had the leader at the top and the passing down of the orders and all that. </sentence><sentence id="731">Now actually it turned out that things didn't work quite the way the Nazi organization book specified but at least that was the theory then, and that was exchanged at these meetings. </sentence><sentence id="732">So that helped us keep abreast of each other, and I think Whitney Harris and I are both very proud of having done that. </sentence><sentence id="733">Jackson came and spoke to one of them. </sentence><sentence id="734">Now <span class="building">Storey</span> held weekly staff conferences. </sentence><sentence id="735">And at those staff conferences, the people in the <span class="building">Documentation Division</span> would report on various things. </sentence><sentence id="736">And as they began to develop rough preliminary trial briefs, these would be available if you wanted to see them, but normally speaking they weren't exchanged...that it was felt that this is getting out material that wasn't particularly thoroughly checked yet. </sentence><sentence id="737">It might get into the wrong hands, the <span class="spatial object">press</span> and so on. </sentence><sentence id="738">But I could go and find out what was the status of the brief in another <span class="region">section</span> or they could come and say, "What's the status of the brief on destruction of the trade unions and the creation of the German Labor Front," and I would show them everything I had. </sentence><sentence id="739">So these briefs were created in advance of the trial, and from them Jackson while even while they were in preliminary shape, Jackson began to draft the indictment. </sentence><sentence id="740">And so David Maxwell-Fyfe"", later Lord Kilmuir, the Lord...the Chancellor of <span class="country">England</span> came over to see what Jackson was doing because between the time of the <span class="populated place">London</span> Agreement on August 8th and the issuance of the indictment on about October 17th, or something like that, of 1945, there was a great deal of work had to be done. </sentence><sentence id="741">And the...the French and the Russians didn't come into <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span> until, oh, sometime in late August or September. ( </sentence><sentence id="742">Clearing Throat) Well, and...and certainly not even until September or early October. </sentence><sentence id="743">And Jackson didn't know very much about the two...about one of the defendants the Russians wanted to have indicted and who was indicted, Fritzsche. </sentence><sentence id="744">Or even about Raeder, who was the Grand Admiral of the Navy, but who'd kind of fallen out with Hitler in 1943, and kind of become inactive. </sentence><sentence id="745">So these became things that had to be quickly developed into some kind of a form degdegMr. </sentence><sentence id="746">David Maxwell-Fyfe, Deputy Chief Prosecutor, <span class="country">United Kingdom</span>. </sentence><sentence id="747"> 6 so that Jackson could help draft his brief and so we could have materials to put in the brief on these other subjects. </sentence><sentence id="748">Now the Russians insisted on putting in a lot of materials about what happened in...in <span class="country">Russia</span>, including the <span class="building">Katyn business</span> within... The French brought in a lot of things, including that 7 and a half francs were stolen by someone on the <span class="dlf">street corner</span>. </sentence><sentence id="749">It was a tremendous detail that the French brought in about what had been purloined and spoliated in <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="750">And they insisted on some of this being put into the indictment, which made the indictment overly long. </sentence><sentence id="751">In my view, it was overly long even from what we put into it, but you put in additional amounts of the French and the Russians...and the Soviets insisted on putting in, and you got too long an indictment. </sentence><sentence id="752">Uh...The Americans...(clearing throat)....it was just understood that since Jackson had pushed for the trials and had been the main leader in negotiating the London Agreement, that the Americans would take the conspiracy count, Count One, and present most of the materials on that. </sentence><sentence id="753">After we presented a fair amount of materials on that, it became so clear that the British had a lot to do because they were working on Count Two, which was the waging of aggressive war, that we better combine some of these so actually we had some presentations during that aggressive war part by British counsel in addition to American counsel. </sentence><sentence id="754">And the British and the Americans got on extremely well together in the trials. </sentence><sentence id="755">I think we had...there was a mutual admiration at the top as well as down in the <span class="interior space">ranks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="756">Uh...a lot of mutual respect. </sentence><sentence id="757">The British had only Sir David Maxwell...Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe, and about six barristers. </sentence><sentence id="758">But they were superior. </sentence><sentence id="759">They were terrific. </sentence><sentence id="760">And they...on cross examination, for example, did better jobs on the whole than we did. </sentence><sentence id="761">Now <span class="populated place">Jackson</span> was not a good cross examiner. </sentence><sentence id="762">Uh...That was not his <span class="building">fort</span>. </sentence><sentence id="763">He was a great advocate. </sentence><sentence id="764">He knew how to express things in the English language with a flavor and a...uh..stirring vocabulary which no one else had. </sentence><sentence id="765">Sir Hartley Shawcross, who was the main chief British prosecutor in the...in a tribute to Jackson, after Jackson died in 1954, said that there was no...no one among the British staff that equaled him in terms of his capacity to use the English language, which is rather interesting. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="809">Q: You've started telling us about some of the...the defense team. </sentence><sentence id="810">Would you tell us more about the people involved some more about <span class="populated place">Jackson</span> and <span class="populated place">Storey</span> and some of the others? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="813">A: All right. </sentence><sentence id="814">Justice Jackson had gotten to know a man by the name of Sidney Alderman very well because of Alderman's presentations before the <span class="building">Supreme Court</span>. </sentence><sentence id="815">He was the General Counsel of the <span class="dlf">Southern Railroad</span>, and he asked Alderman to become one of his top deputies and to assist him. </sentence><sentence id="816">Uh...I first met Alderman when I got to <span class="populated place">London</span> and then in <span class="populated place">Paris</span> again. </sentence><sentence id="817">Uh...Alderman was a...had an incredible capability to read an awful lot of materials that were submitted to him to digest them and to make a coherent, relatively succinct statement out of them. </sentence><sentence id="818">Jackson relied on him a great deal in terms of aggressive war counts, to go over the materials that had been found, to stimulate the attorneys to find more materials, and then to make the final briefs and then for Alderman to make almost all those presentations with several exceptions. </sentence><sentence id="819">And several of those exceptions were British who were brought in and made presentations on aggressive war. </sentence><sentence id="820">And I'm not sure who the American would be that made some as well, but I think there was one. </sentence><sentence id="821">Colonel Storey had done work during the war that had come to the attention of Justice Jackson, and he'd been a...gone abroad for OSS on a thing or two. </sentence><sentence id="822">And Jackson thought he'd be a good man to head up the <span class="building">Documentation  7 Division</span>, and brought him in and shipped him directly to <span class="populated place">Paris</span>. </sentence><sentence id="823">And...the amount of materials that few of us...few research analysts and a few others found in <span class="populated place">Paris</span> was so much greater in terms of volume and relevance to what was being found by the Joint British- American team in <span class="country">England</span> based on the documents they had, that Jackson began to insist on bringing more people into <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="824">And a lot of them didn't like...or into <span class="populated place">Paris</span>, and most...lot of them didn't like to come because <span class="populated place">London</span> life was very nice and they didn't think <span class="populated place">Paris</span> life was so great. </sentence><sentence id="825">But he did finally bring a group into <span class="populated place">Paris</span> and within 2 or 3 weeks, got them to go into <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="826">And Colonel Storey was then made Executive Trial Counsel, and after the indictment was in the last stages, he was through his deputies and associates, was probably contributing more toward what went into the indictment than any single person so it became logical for Jackson to appoint him Executive Trial Counsel. </sentence><sentence id="827">And what Storey did was first prepare a basis for informing the <span class="building">court</span> as to how we'd captured these documents, to how we'd process them, and so on so we didn't have to prove in each case the document source and it would have delayed the trial tremendously. </sentence><sentence id="828">So a major by the man of Coogan, Major Coogan, had been appointed the person to go and search out files in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="829">Actually, he didn't speak German, so he had some assistants who actually helped him a great deal. </sentence><sentence id="830">And he brought....he with the man who helped find the...or bring back the Rosenberg files, and a number of other files to <span class="populated place">Paris</span> and then take them into <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="831">Then he left the staff, and he never presented the case or anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="832">Major Baldwin, later Colonel Baldwin, became (clearing throat) Storey's assistant and he and I became quite close and he asked me to or we went to <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span> together to open the <span class="building">courthouse</span> you might say...if I would like to share a <span class="building">house</span> with him, which I did. </sentence><sentence id="833">And when it came to presenting cases I'm sure he put in a good word for me. </sentence><sentence id="834">And he'd presented the case against Hans Frank, the Governor-General of <span class="country">Poland</span>, and before our presentations why we'd critique each other back in our little <span class="building">house</span> where we stayed so as to try to perfect our presentations. </sentence><sentence id="835">Baldwin was extremely valuable to Storey because he took a awful lot of administrative detail, and this gave Storey legs you might say to work more on getting materials in to <span class="populated place">Jackson</span>. </sentence><sentence id="836">Another very important person was Colonel Leonard Wheeler, Jr. of whom you have a little letter in there that he wrote about to me. </sentence><sentence id="837">He became...he's the head of the <span class="building">Documentation Division</span> in <span class="country">Britain</span>. </sentence><sentence id="838">And when they...he came to <span class="populated place">Paris</span> and then on into <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span>, he was made Storey's deputy. </sentence><sentence id="839">And either Jackson or else Storey made the decision that they should sit together almost back to back in the head...in this central large <span class="interior space">room</span> of the <span class="building">Documentation Division</span> so as to prove that these two staffs had merged on the one hand and on the other hand to show that there was complete trust about exchanging materials. </sentence><sentence id="840">And they worked very well together. </sentence><sentence id="841">Storey decided to present to the <span class="building">Tribunal</span> some of the cases against the criminal organizations, and Wheeler presented the case against suppression of the <span class="building">Christian churches</span>. </sentence><sentence id="842">Then both of them left <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span> in January of 1946, along with a lot of other people who were there and left behind only about four or five of us who had developed materials and cases and so on to assist Jackson and tie him down. </sentence><sentence id="843">That's kind of how the staff developed and how it worked. </sentence><sentence id="844">There was a tremendous number of lawyers who were a little unhappy about how things went and if obviously they didn't...perhaps didn't get as big a title as they wanted or something like that, an awful lot of them wanted to get <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="845">They'd been overseas or one thing or another, and some of them that I'm sure could have done very good work had they stayed on left as soon as they'd made  8 their presentations and a lot of them who weren't assigned to make a presentation before the <span class="building">Tribunal</span> immediately left, so that left the rest of us with more research analysts than we'd had before and a smaller staff. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="937">A: Well, mostly the...the Germans were so shell shocked from the process of the bombings and all... <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span> had been bombed incredibly and a tremendous number of people had been killed. </sentence><sentence id="938">I don't know, I think next to...to <span class="populated place">Dresden</span> and <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, probably <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span> had gotten a big a hit as almost any <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="939">Well, that's not quite true. </sentence><sentence id="940">There was some <span class="populated place">cities</span> in the <span class="region">Ruhr</span> that had got it as well. </sentence><sentence id="941">But people were on very poor rations. </sentence><sentence id="942">You could see it in their faces. </sentence><sentence id="943">You could buy anything for a few packs of cigarettes. </sentence><sentence id="944">There was quite a traffic in...whatever people had been able to save from their bombed out places, they'd trade it off with farmers, peasants around <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span> in order to get enough to get enough to barely pass eating. </sentence><sentence id="945">Actually, the Americans sent in rations and the Germans were...the rations were fortified by the Americans for some time. </sentence><sentence id="946">One reason we were able to attract so many of the people around <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span> who spoke both languages to help us in the <span class="building">courthouse</span> was that they immediately got a different ration. </sentence><sentence id="947">And one reason the defense counsel were delighted after they were put on a list, the defense counsel on which the defendants could choose. </sentence><sentence id="948">One of the things they were very happy about is that they got a very good ration. </sentence><sentence id="949">Now their ration wasn't up to ours, but they did get an inferior brand of cigarettes and they got a mild amount of whiskey I think, probably an off-brand, but they also got a basic...food rations. </sentence><sentence id="950">And who...with whomever they lived in <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span> they would share this, of course, and then at lunch, we built a defense counsel mess. </sentence><sentence id="951">And they would stack up on food in the defense counsel mess, but for breakfast and for dinners they ate in their own...in the <span class="building">lodgings</span> they'd found in <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="952">A couple of the defense counsels came from <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span>, including Streicher's counsel. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="969">Q: You told me before that you worked on different aspects of this, including the early German opposition to Hitler. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="971">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="973">Q: Would you tell us about that, and about how you dealt with that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="975">A: Well, I had known from my work with OSS and from contacts I made in <span class="populated place">London</span> and elsewhere that there were Germans who'd been in <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span> and who had survived who would make supposedly pretty good witnesses. </sentence><sentence id="976">So, for instance, one witness by the name of Matthias Lex, <span class="spatial object">L-E-X</span>, was the head of the Shoemakers" Union of <span class="country">Germany</span>, and he was located in <span class="populated place">Munich</span>. </sentence><sentence id="977">And he had been in <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>"! </sentence><sentence id="978">steadily from 1933 until 1938, 5 years. </sentence><sentence id="979">In the process, he had seen happen in <span class="populated place">Dachau</span> tremendous number of things. </sentence><sentence id="980">In the first place, he'd seen the opposition come in, and he'd made an affidavit for me in which he'd listed by name, 40 people including a bishop whose name I forget right now, but he listed various top leaders who'd been confined in roughly the periods that he'd recalled that they'd been confined in...in the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="981">And then he included...then he told about how, after a certain period of time, Jews were begun to be brought into <span class="populated place">Dachau</span> after Goering had begun his nefarious work in <span class="region">Prussia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="982">And likewise he mentioned that the <span class="building">Bibelforscher</span>, the </sentence></p><p><sentence id="983"> "Correction of Interviewee: <span class="populated place">Concentration Camp Dachau</span>. </sentence><sentence id="984"> 0 Bible Students, that there were 150 of them which had been brought into <span class="populated place">Dachau</span> and about 150 Gypsies that were there at a certain time. </sentence><sentence id="985">So all of this I put into this affidavit. </sentence><sentence id="986">And this led to other people following up on those <span class="dlf">leads</span> to get a lot...a lot of further materials. </sentence><sentence id="987">I don't mean to say that this is the only thing. </sentence><sentence id="988">It was one of the things that helped a lot. </sentence><sentence id="989">And there had been some indications that what we should do is put on some of the former leaders of the <span class="country">Weimar Republic</span> as to tell what had happened to them and that we should put on some of the leaders of the Jewish organizations outside of <span class="country">Germany</span> to talk about what had happened. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="990">This was pretty much voted down on the theory that we had better evidence on the one hand, and number two, that these people would be long winded, if not garrulous, and that it would prolong the trial a lot more. </sentence><sentence id="991">So what we did was use the information we got from these people and those cases in which it was useful to help us with leads and things like that. </sentence><sentence id="992">And on the whole the trial was based on contemporaneous German documents or upon (clearing throat) witnesses who had been in <span class="country">Germany</span> or who'd been in the <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="993">Now in the case of <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, we got the commander of the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> who was not captured until about April of 1946, and he wasn't there during the early part, but we got him, and the British sent him to <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span>, and the American's interrogated him. </sentence><sentence id="994">And he just laid it out in black and white as to how the <span class="populated place">Auschwitz concentration camp</span> was made, how it was organized, and how many people were exterminated there, and the whole story on the Gypsies... which and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="995">His name was Rudolph Hoess, <span class="building">H-O-E-S-S</span>, and after he was shipped to <span class="country">Poland</span> where he was tried, convicted, sentenced and before he was executed, he wrote a book called "Commandant of <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>." </sentence><sentence id="996">And that book has in it...some of the materials on the Gypsies. </sentence><sentence id="997">Actually, I was wrong. </sentence><sentence id="998">He didn't give the material on the Gypsies while he was in <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span> because he was not asked unfortunately. </sentence><sentence id="999">But when he was...in this book he wrote the full story on what happened to the Gypsies and on these materials, people like Martin Gilbert and others later found a lot more materials, and that whole case on the Gypsies had developed a lot more than it ever was developed at the Nuremberg trials, unfortunately. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1000">A: Did you have any contact with <span class="populated place">Hoess</span> at all? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1002">Q: With whom? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1006">Q: No. </sentence><sentence id="1007">I didn't. </sentence><sentence id="1008">I mean I saw him in <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span>, but I didn't talk to him nor did I interrogate him. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1009">Q: You talked to other victims? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1011">A: I talked to people who did talk to him. </sentence><sentence id="1012">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1013">And suggested some questions, but I didn't...I was not in the <span class="building">Interrogation Division</span>, and by the time he came the... Actually, he was called as a defense witness by Ernst Kaltenbrunner, the top SS man on the <span class="dlf">dock</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1014">But we'd interrogated him as well during the cross examination of him. </sentence><sentence id="1015">We just put in this affidavit and asked him if he would like to correct any part of it, and he said  1 no. </sentence><sentence id="1016">And then a few of the highlights were brought out for the <span class="building">court</span> and that was that. </sentence><sentence id="1017">There was some incredible German witnesses as you may know from reading the judgment. </sentence><sentence id="1018">One was a man by the name of Graebe, G-R-A-E-B-E, who had been the leader of a <span class="building">German factory</span> that was established in <span class="country">Russia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1019">I forget the name of the <span class="populated place">town</span> at this point. </sentence><sentence id="1020">But he talked about how he was required to release Jews who were working in this <span class="building">factory</span> and that he heard about how they were being exterminated and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1021">So one day he just went out to where he heard they were being shot and put into <span class="dlf">trenches</span> actually and buried in <span class="dlf">trenches</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1022">And he went out there and before the SS prevented him, he was able to watch a whole sequence of this go on. </sentence><sentence id="1023">So he became a witness and testified at <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span> and quite a bit of his testimony is reproduced in the actual judgment of the <span class="building">Tribunal</span>, as indicating how these Einsatzgruppen worked in <span class="country">Russia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1024">And of course, we had tremendously impressive evidence on that subject from Otto Ohlendorf, who was the head of one of the four Einsatzgruppen himself. </sentence><sentence id="1025">But Ohlendorf was not as the big boss at the top of that group in the same position to talk about what had happened in a specific extermination of a particular <span class="populated place">city</span>, <span class="populated place">village</span> in <span class="country">Russia</span>, that Graebe was able to talk about. </sentence><sentence id="1026">So you see we have this combination of materials, contemporaneous documents, a few German witnesses on whom we had materials. </sentence><sentence id="1027">And in the case of <span class="populated place">Ohlendorf</span>, he knew that he eventually was going to be tried and that he'd get the <span class="spatial object">rope</span>, he talked quite freely. </sentence><sentence id="1028">And then we had people like Graebe who talked quite freely or talked very freely without any reservation. </sentence><sentence id="1029">And if I'm not mistaken Graebe and if not, someone like him, found it very uncomfortable living in <span class="country">Germany</span> just after the war and went to...to <span class="country">Israel</span>, and that a <span class="dlf">street</span> is named for him and a <span class="spatial object">statue</span> has been erected for him. </sentence><sentence id="1030">Now if it isn't 1 can check up on who that is, but it's one of...someone like that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1051">Q: What other witnesses come to mind that strike you by their testimony? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1053">A: The witness I'm trying to think about, whose name escapes me unfortunately, was our our first witness and he was the deputy to head of the Abwehr", and he'd been on the list to be extermin...to be executed by Hitler's hangman after the attempt on Hitler's life. </sentence><sentence id="1054">He was our first witness and was able to give tremendously impressive testimony. </sentence><sentence id="1055">But it took so much time. </sentence><sentence id="1056">It took, you know, nearly a day by the time the defense was done cross examining him. </sentence><sentence id="1057">Now actually he was not cross examined by the defense as much, to show that things were wrong that he said, as he was questioned in a couple of cases to try to bring out materials that helped particular defendants. </sentence><sentence id="1058">For instance, Schacht was able to...Schacht's attorney was able to use him to indicate that Schacht had nothing to do with this and that and the other thing, and that Schacht was also suspected...was known to be a part of the opposition, but he didn't dare show his face very much and therefore, he wasn't very obvious as some of the others were. </sentence><sentence id="1059">I'll bring a note on some of the leading witnesses at the next time if you like. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1067">Q: What else would you like to tell us about that first trial before we move on or the first set of the trials? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1092">Q: Tell us about those two presentations. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1094">A: Well, I had partly discussed them in the case of Baldur Von Schirach, the Youth Leader, and the Gauleiter of <span class="populated place">Vienna</span> earlier, and of course, Hans Fritzsche who was the radio propagandist. </sentence><sentence id="1095">And I gave you a bit on that before too. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1098">Q: The first set of trials as they wound down, the Nuremberg Trials you began to prepare for subsequent trials. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1100">A: You said set of trials. </sentence><sentence id="1101">There was only one. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1104">Q: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1105">You're right. </sentence><sentence id="1106">As the Trial wound down, you began... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1110">A: Actually, when the trial was...the prosecution was still putting on his case...people who had developed different materials were either going to leave or they were going to be used for something else, and so I made this recommendation to Jackson that we start to think about subsequent trials and he immediately made me Director of the <span class="building">Subsequent Proceedings Division</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1111">And from that time on, which was already in the same month the Trial opened, November of 1945, from then on we...a small group of us started to prepare materials and watch for materials that people on the main case found which would lead toward possible trials later on. </sentence><sentence id="1112">And for instance, on experiments on human beings, medical experiments...Now there was early materials that had been found on that during the first trial, but they weren't terribly extensive, but they were sufficient enough so that they were made a part of the case in chief and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1113">I suggested to Alexander Hardy that he might want...when he came over at about April of 1946 that he might want to get in on..in on the medical cases that I thought he...it was the kind of thing that would interest him. </sentence><sentence id="1114">He took it over and developed a tremendous case which led to the materials that are now reproduced in the green volumes, volumes | and 2, about all the various medical experiments, a lot of which weren't  3 touched at all in the main trial. </sentence><sentence id="1115">The second case...second subsequent proceedings was against Milch, which I thought was a mistake because it used up a whole <span class="building">Tribunal</span> of three judges for one man and...but he was involved in medical experiments because as the deputy of Goering for material Air Force procurement, he'd had under him this research and they thought maybe some of these experiments would have some...some use to the air forces...the high altitude experiments, cold water experiments, etc., </sentence><sentence id="1116">etc. </sentence><sentence id="1117">So Milch was tried on that count plus the use of slave labor because he was on the Central Planning Board, along with Speer and Sauckel, the head of the Plenipotentiary for Labor Recruitment. </sentence><sentence id="1118">And that those materials from the labor recruitment was plainly done at a time when there was obvious tremendous number of slave labors were being used, that <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> inmates were being used, etc., </sentence><sentence id="1119">etc. </sentence><sentence id="1120">Now the details of a lot of those cases were not developed until the secondary trials, the next 12 trials in <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1132">Q: Can you talk a little more about how these cases were developed? </sentence><sentence id="1133">The people you've brought in...you've mentioned some...to develop them, and what the atmosphere was, political pressures and otherwise, as you develop them...a very different atmosphere. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1136">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1137">Before the first trial was over, tensions were already developing between the <span class="country">United States</span> and the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1138">Telford Taylor, General Telford Taylor who succeeded Jackson, had hoped very much to arrange at least one more international trial with the four powers working together and the judges representing the four powers, four Allied powers on the <span class="spatial object">bench</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1139">This quickly disappeared as a possibility because of this tension. </sentence><sentence id="1140">And the Russians after the first trial left <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1141">They left a liaison person or two behind, but they absolutely cleared out, including taking some of the <span class="spatial object">furniture</span> that we supplied to them and all their files and all the rest of this business. </sentence><sentence id="1142">Which is...they were certainly entitled to take their <span class="spatial object">files</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1143">But they weren't very cooperative with respect to any later trials. </sentence><sentence id="1144">So we decided to go ahead. </sentence><sentence id="1145">Now actually the French were in such bad shape from the occupation by <span class="country">Germany</span> that they could not afford to do very much and they tried an awful lot of collaborators and French people and the few Germans that they got their hands on, but an awful lot of French justice was, I'm afraid, hanging people on the <span class="dlf">streets</span> or shooting them right on hand without trial. </sentence><sentence id="1146">And later on, as things quieted down, and they wanted to hold trials they really were short handed. </sentence><sentence id="1147">One of their people, a fellow by the name of Charles Gerthoffer, was at <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span> and was a liaison to the economics cases. </sentence><sentence id="1148">I helped him prepare the case against <span class="building">Roechling</span>, which was one of the fourth largest enterprises in <span class="country">Germany</span> and it had been very active in using slave labors in <span class="populated place">Wurttemberg</span> and in the <span class="region">French zone</span>, what later became the <span class="region">French zone</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1149">So we did help the French in that respect with a trial or two. </sentence><sentence id="1150">The British became so involved in reconstituting things that they conducted very few trials except those involving British officers. </sentence><sentence id="1151">And the one involving von Manstein, which was a...who was a leading German marshall in the invasion of the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span> as well as several other places, and he was prosecuted, actually, by Major Elwyn Jones, who was on the British Delegation during the first trial, who later prosecuted him. </sentence><sentence id="1152">He was the only <span class="building">Labour Member of Parliament</span> who was in the...permanently in <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1153">He went back to <span class="populated place">London</span> after this trial and got into the labor government on two different occasions and became the Lord Chancellor of <span class="country">England</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1154">And his title is Lord Elwyn Jones. </sentence><sentence id="1155">He wouldn't  4 take another name. </sentence><sentence id="1156">He was originally a Welshman. </sentence><sentence id="1157">Well, that's a digression, but that indicates a little something there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1180">Q: In these trials you were dealing particularly with things such as medical experiments, crimes against Jews, Gypsies, homosexuals...those kinds of things to a level of detail. </sentence><sentence id="1181">Can you tell us about that and tell us about some other witnesses? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1184">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1185">Well, I think I might just go down the list of the cases. </sentence><sentence id="1186">The first trial, first subsequent trial involved the medical experiments. </sentence><sentence id="1187">And incidentally in that trial, one of the defendants was a woman. </sentence><sentence id="1188">And the only woman" who was tried in the Nuremberg trials. </sentence><sentence id="1189">And she received a sentence for a term of years. </sentence><sentence id="1190">I forget what. </sentence><sentence id="1191">The second trial was against Erhard Milch who is Goering's deputy and he was sentenced to a life in <span class="building">prison</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1192">The third trial was the so-called Justice case and it was a case against people who'd been...the chief judges of <span class="building">peoples courts</span> or the prosecutors in <span class="building">peoples courts</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1193">And the film which was later done with Spencer Tracy on the...Justice at <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span> involved that trial and a very small part of that trial if you will recall and that trial was the main prosecutor in that underneath General Taylor was a former Republican Congressman by the name of Charles LaFollette. </sentence><sentence id="1194">As far as I know the only former congressman that appeared in <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1195">The fourth trial was a so- called...the fourth trial was, I think, the Einsatzgruppen case, which was tried by Benjamin Ferencz as the main prosecutor under Taylor, and he's written a book since called, Less than Slaves. </sentence><sentence id="1196">After he'd presented this case against the main Einsatzgruppen leaders who had gone into <span class="country">Poland</span> and <span class="country">Russia</span> and killed so many people, he became head of the Jewish Restitution Successor Organization. </sentence><sentence id="1197">And built up enough case so that the German Government, although not accepting the theory of collective responsibility which I also do not accept, they agreed that it is right that recompense be made to all survivors that could be found, number one, and that where the survivors couldn't be found, the equivalent amount of money for a person killed would be sent to <span class="country">Israel</span>, which did help in the reconstitution or the getting <span class="country">Israel</span> on its feet to a greater extent. </sentence><sentence id="1198">Well, that was the, I think, the fourth case. </sentence><sentence id="1199">The fifth case was the first of three industrialist cases. </sentence><sentence id="1200">The first one was against Friedrich Flick, and involved a relatively small number of defendants about eight or so, including the Papa Flick himself. </sentence><sentence id="1201">And they were tried on slave labor using large numbers of slave labors, using <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> inmates, and going into occupied countries as <span class="building">Flick Enterprises</span> and...and profiting from using the property of occupied people against the laws of war. </sentence><sentence id="1202">They got relatively short sentences. </sentence><sentence id="1203">I forget just what they were. </sentence><sentence id="1204">The sixth case is <span class="building">I.G. Farben</span> where, the case of <span class="building">I.G.Farben</span> industry, where I was chief of the trial team. </sentence><sentence id="1205">And we indicted a total of 23 leaders of the <span class="populated place">Farben concern</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1206">Now by this time I should say the gentle notion was developing that the...lot of these industrialists and so on were very capable people and should be drawn into the industry that was being reconstituted in the <span class="region">western zone</span> as well as in the <span class="region">British zone</span>, <span class="region">French zone</span>, and so there's a tendency to encourage us to hurry up with the trials number one, and number two later on, there was a which I can cover at another time, there was Correction of Interviewee: Mr. Sprecher states that there were in fact two women tried at <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1207">He is referring in this instance to Frau Herta Oberheuser. </sentence><sentence id="1208"> 5 tremendous pressure about reducing the sentences of some of these people. </sentence><sentence id="1209">They were convicted. </sentence><sentence id="1210">Now General Taylor would have none of this reducing sentences and he was backed up by General Clay. </sentence><sentence id="1211">So there was none of the reduction of sentences during the four years that I was at <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1212">Well, to go on from the I.G.
