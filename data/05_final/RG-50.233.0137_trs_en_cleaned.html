<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="26">Q: Do you know where their families lived, your parents" families? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="28">A: No, I know. </sentence><sentence id="29">Yes my parents" family lived in the <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span> of the <span class="populated place">Yodebrastaat</span>. </sentence><sentence id="30">We lived right after the war in the <span class="dlf">Tunsvalstraat</span> right on the <span class="dlf">Tunsvalkad</span> which was a <span class="dlf">canal</span> as <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span> is crisscrossed by <span class="dlf">canals</span>. </sentence><sentence id="31">Is there anything else I could say about my parents? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="36">Q: Do you know anything about Jewishly like were they religious, were they observant? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="38">A: Yes, my parents both went to <span class="building">Hebrew school</span> when they were younger. </sentence><sentence id="39">We were not a <span class="building">kosher home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="40">You must understand that the Dutch Jews were mostly working class people and while my parents and their families set a <span class="spatial object">table</span> every Friday night there were no prayers said and I don't think there were blessings said over the bread or wine with the meal but all the children would be there for that dinner and some with their sweetie pies and after dinner they would all leave for their Friday night gallivanting, you know young people. </sentence><sentence id="41">There's not much talk in my family of poverty or anything like that even during the depression. </sentence><sentence id="42">There were hard times. </sentence><sentence id="43">There was always food. </sentence><sentence id="44">My father worked in the food trades, in the restaurant trade and always had food, brought <span class="building">home</span> food. </sentence><sentence id="45">So there was always that. </sentence><sentence id="46">And also he was one of the brothers who always seemed to have worked during the hard years. </sentence><sentence id="47">My grandmothers did not work. </sentence><sentence id="48">They were grandmothers which was a job in itself. </sentence><sentence id="49">My mother and father knew each other when they were in their late teens. </sentence><sentence id="50">And as my mother tells it, she had a crush on my father because he was so quiet and sweet and I guess, polite. </sentence><sentence id="51">They met each other through my father's sister Maricha, Marie who perished and had become sweethearts very early on and had been very fond of each other and close to each other. </sentence><sentence id="52">It was, I guess, in those days that you paired up real early. </sentence><sentence id="53">But they were engaged for a long time. </sentence><sentence id="54">They didn't married until they were thirty and the reason for that is that they wanted to save money for <span class="spatial object">furniture</span>. </sentence><sentence id="55">And now my mother talks about how she regrets in light of course not knowing about the war that they didn't get married sooner and have babies sooner. </sentence><sentence id="56">And I always kind of wondered why they didn't have more babies and in some ways regret not having children. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="76">Q: Do you know your parents" dates of birth? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="78">A: Yes, of course. </sentence><sentence id="79">You know at a certain age if you don't send them a birthday card you have hell to pay. </sentence><sentence id="80">My father was born in 1911, May 25". </sentence><sentence id="81">My mother was born in 1910, June 14". </sentence><sentence id="82">So we're all summer babies. </sentence><sentence id="83">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="84">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="85"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="94">Q: So that was the situation leading up to the war. </sentence><sentence id="95">Ha your mother been working, did she have a career? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="98">A: Yes, she was a seamstress. </sentence><sentence id="99">She talks about having loved her career as a seamstress. </sentence><sentence id="100">In her manuscript which she spent seven years writing she talks about the <span class="building">shop</span> she was in. </sentence><sentence id="101">She talks about the labor struggles. </sentence><sentence id="102">During this time there were many, many labor struggles. </sentence><sentence id="103">My parents were as many Dutch Jews were working class people and by and large they voted for the Social Democratic Party which here we would mistakenly call Socialist or Left. </sentence><sentence id="104">They were a liberal democratic party whose interests represented working class people. </sentence><sentence id="105">And they also took part of the culture of the Social Democratic Parties and on the first of May, you'd have picnics, you'd have festivals. </sentence><sentence id="106">You would often have camping trips that these parties of the Left provided for young people which my parents often went to. </sentence><sentence id="107">And your question before about a <span class="building">religious household</span>, I do not recall ever having heard my parents talk about a <span class="building">religious household</span> although there are some times now when I talk to my mother and she disputes that. </sentence><sentence id="108">And I think she may dispute it because there is some matter of pride but I don't think, and she would know better than I what happened in those years, but I never heard talk about her religious upbringing. </sentence><sentence id="109">I know we never had a <span class="building">kosher home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="110">The first time I stepped into a <span class="building">shul</span> was when I was Bar Mitzvahed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="124">Q: Really? </sentence><sentence id="125">So you didn't go for the High Holidays or anything like that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="128">A: Before we were Bar Mitzvahed my parents pleaded with my brother and I to go to <span class="building">shul</span> for the High Holidays and we didn't. </sentence><sentence id="129">And we compromised. </sentence><sentence id="130">We said well we'll get dressed and we" ll walk around <span class="building">temple</span> so everyone will see us but we're not going in because we didn't know Hebrew and also being refugees and being survivors we felt in a way alienated from the Jewish community about us. </sentence><sentence id="131">And that is something that is very typical of people with our story. </sentence><sentence id="132">In some way we were met with a lot of not understanding. </sentence><sentence id="133">I always have felt very alienated from Judaism. </sentence><sentence id="134">I knew when I grew up in <span class="populated place">Brooklyn</span> there were times where I would be beaten up for being Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="135">Easter would roll around and the Italian kids, boys, would come from <span class="dlf">Avenue X</span> and we lived on <span class="dlf">Avenue Z</span> and <span class="dlf">Avenue Y</span> was a <span class="dlf">dividing line</span> and you had the Italian people living on <span class="dlf">Avenue X</span> and the Jewish people living on Avenue Z. And as what was popularly known then Jewish boys did not fight. </sentence><sentence id="136">They did not fight. </sentence><sentence id="137">So Easter would come around and I with my friends would be playing outside and Italian boys would come into the <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span> and they would tell us we killed Christ. </sentence><sentence id="138">And I didn't know who this boy Christ was, I had no idea. </sentence><sentence id="139">And I certainly knew that I and no one had killed anybody recently. </sentence><sentence id="140">So they would attack us and beat us up. </sentence><sentence id="141">We didn't know about fighting back. </sentence><sentence id="142">So that happened a few times. </sentence><sentence id="143">And I guess that was one of many punctuation marks in my feeling not Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="144">And for many years I did not in some way come out as being Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="145">I did not come forward with it. </sentence><sentence id="146">I did not cultivate my social relationships based on people being Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="147">I had friends from all kinds of groups as I do now. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="168">Q: But meanwhile though your parents had settled in a basically <span class="region">Jewish area</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="170">A: Well, yes, yes. </sentence><sentence id="171">We came to <span class="country">America</span> in 1949, my parents, my brother, who was really my step- brother as I'll go on to tell later, my aunt and uncle and their two daughters. </sentence><sentence id="172">We lived in <span class="populated place">Far Rockaway</span>. </sentence><sentence id="173">First few months we had an <span class="interior space">attic</span> and we all slept on <span class="spatial object">cots</span> in the <span class="interior space">attic</span>. </sentence><sentence id="174">And then at some point we got an <span class="interior space">apartment</span> in <span class="populated place">Rockaway</span>. </sentence><sentence id="175">We got two <span class="interior space">basement apartments</span> which were about three blocks from the <span class="env feature">ocean</span> which us kids in the family absolutely loved because it meant This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="176">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="177"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection our summers we had a lot to do and to play. </sentence><sentence id="178">But in the spring when the rains came the <span class="interior space">basement</span> would always be flooded and we'd always have to buy a new rug. </sentence><sentence id="179">So it was a sort of immigrant story. </sentence><sentence id="180">And then in 1951 when <span class="building">Beachhaven</span> which was one of the first projects that Fred Trump built (which is the Donald's father) built in <span class="populated place">Brooklyn</span>, my parents moved out there. </sentence><sentence id="181">It was a very big step. </sentence><sentence id="182">It really was an attempt for my parents to start to build something for us. </sentence><sentence id="183">At one point they talked about wanting to move to <span class="region">Long Island</span> which was also considered a step up and buy a <span class="building">home</span> there which they never did. </sentence><sentence id="184">I as of late come to understand that there was a subtext to our life which was around the matter of denial and that had to do with getting on with life and putting all that stuff behind us, just get on with life. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="202">Q: I hate to stop you but could you tell me what happened to your family during the war? </sentence><sentence id="203">We started with your birth so there are two more years at least. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="206">A: There's plenty. </sentence><sentence id="207">So I was born on August second. </sentence><sentence id="208">This was the time when people were already being deported to <span class="populated place">Vestaburg</span> which was a <span class="populated place">transit camp</span> in the north of <span class="country">Holland</span>, in the <span class="env feature">moors</span>, God forsaken nowhere place. </sentence><sentence id="209">From <span class="populated place">Vestaburg</span> every Tuesday the <span class="spatial object">transport</span> went east. </sentence><sentence id="210">People went either to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, to <span class="populated place">Treblinka</span>, to <span class="populated place">Sobibor</span>, to <span class="populated place">Chelmo</span> where most of my grandparents, aunts and uncles perished. </sentence><sentence id="211">Because our name was Trompettor and as I said not like Cohen or a lot of typical Dutch Jewish names my father who belonged to a butcher's union which was taken over by the Dutch Fascists, the Jewish names would all be crossed off. </sentence><sentence id="212">Trompettor was not crossed off which meant we would continue to get their news letter but this time with the National Socialist masthead on it. </sentence><sentence id="213">So my father would conspicuously leave it on a little side <span class="spatial object">table</span> by the <span class="dlf">door</span> in case there were raids and people would come in they would see this and think my father was not Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="214"><span class="interior space">Upstairs</span> though in the same <span class="building">house</span> lived my mother's parents. </sentence><sentence id="215">During this time the <span class="building">Jewish Council</span> in <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span> as there were in many <span class="country">countries</span> had a list of all the people who were in <span class="country">Holland</span> who were Jewish and the list was made available to the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="216">And I know there is much argument about the role of the <span class="building">Jewish Council</span>. </sentence><sentence id="217">Because my parents were, I guess, working class people and sympathetic to the left of the <span class="region">political spectrum</span> they had a certain kind of savvy about what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="218">In <span class="country">Holland</span> from "33 on you had over 25,000 German Jewish refugees so stories got around. </sentence><sentence id="219">People got a sense of the brutality that was there. </sentence><sentence id="220">When my father was arrested and beaten up as he tells it, he was of course among other things shocked. </sentence><sentence id="221">Something like this never happened to him and he felt that with this kind of brutality it was going to get worse and nothing would stop the Germans and that if they were capable of this no one was safe. </sentence><sentence id="222">And that's what he felt. </sentence><sentence id="223">Before that happened there was the curfew, there were people being taken away, there were street fights in <span class="populated place">Jewish neighborhoods</span>. </sentence><sentence id="224">Dutch fascists would come into the <span class="populated place">Jewish neighborhoods</span>, the <span class="building">ice-cream parlors</span>, the <span class="building">tea houses</span> and start fights and there would be these altercations. </sentence><sentence id="225">But when he was beaten up he understood how bad it was and he decided then he was going to go <span class="interior space">underground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="226">He was not going to register. </sentence><sentence id="227">My mother's brother, Shok who is the name I was given, Jack, in honor of him, I think he was a very active Socialist and as my mother tells the story right before or after I was born she's in my parents" <span class="building">home</span> and my mother's brother Shok is still living there she enters into his <span class="interior space">room</span> and sees him with a <span class="spatial object">tallis</span> and he's praying. </sentence><sentence id="228">And she is shocked because she's known him as a what should we call it an agnostic, an atheist. </sentence><sentence id="229">My mother says what's going on? </sentence><sentence id="230">And he says, well he's praying so his parents won't be taken away and has decided that he will go and register in their place. </sentence><sentence id="231">Throughout the early period of the German occupations and the subjugation of the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span> there were continual regulations that were tended to deceive people. </sentence><sentence id="232">One of them was that if the young people in the family would register, the old people would not be taken. </sentence><sentence id="233">This was of course a way of sabotaging and undermining any form of resistance and many, many people believed it. </sentence><sentence id="234">You have to This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="235">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="236"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection understand and appreciate that. </sentence><sentence id="237">What some people might see as stupidity or cooperation isn't quite that. </sentence><sentence id="238">It has to be understood in the context of <span class="country">Holland</span> is a <span class="country">country</span> that's very much concerned with law, with rules, with order. </sentence><sentence id="239">I always feel that they're kind of caught between the anvil of Calvinism and the hammer of Anarchism and the reason for that is because <span class="populated place">cities</span> like <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span> and <span class="populated place">Rotterdam</span> are <span class="populated place">international cities</span> and the Dutch have been for a few hundred years an international merchant people. </sentence><sentence id="240">So not to register was considered an illegal act even though it was clear to many that those who were in power, who made the law, were evil. </sentence><sentence id="241">But my father decided he was not going to register, he was going to do something else. </sentence><sentence id="242">That was a very big step. </sentence><sentence id="243">It was the first step to resistance. </sentence><sentence id="244">Many people of course had no idea what was going on in the <span class="region">east</span> after the <span class="spatial object">transports</span>. </sentence><sentence id="245">People really believed they were going to be settled in some <span class="dlf">farm</span> somewhere to dig potatoes and till the <span class="env feature">soil</span>. </sentence><sentence id="246">But because my father had a certain political savvy he knew what German Fascism meant as people did. </sentence><sentence id="247">So he decided he was not going to register; he was going to go <span class="interior space">underground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="248">The problem was what does that mean? </sentence><sentence id="249">How do you do it? </sentence><sentence id="250">Who do you make contact with? </sentence><sentence id="251">Who do you trust? </sentence><sentence id="252">And it was all luck. </sentence><sentence id="253">So my mother's brother Shok decides he's going to register to save the grandparents. </sentence><sentence id="254">He registers. </sentence><sentence id="255">He is sent to <span class="populated place">Vestaborg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="256">At some point from <span class="populated place">Vestaborg</span> he sends my mother a card, my mother and father a card that says don't bring the red <span class="spatial object">baby wagon</span> which was their code for saying do not come, do not bring Jackie as I was known because even in <span class="populated place">Vestaborg</span> which was not as horrible as the <span class="populated place">camps</span> in the <span class="region">east</span> there was constructed to deceive people. </sentence><sentence id="257">Actually when I say this I am stunned at how remarkable the deception was, to be deceived. </sentence><sentence id="258">In some way I know this is in hindsight I get very angry at it. </sentence><sentence id="259">How could people be so stupid? </sentence><sentence id="260">And on the other hand how can I say that? </sentence><sentence id="261">And all of it is a, it's a mix of feelings one has, I have. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="320">Q: I think you pointed it out when you said how the Dutch people were concerned with order and all that and they say they came in so fast to <span class="country">Holland</span> and people were in shock and they just rounded up and took them out. </sentence><sentence id="321">I don't think they had time to really think. </sentence><sentence id="322">That was my impression. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="326">A: Yeah, but you know they had people coming in from <span class="country">Germany</span> from 1933 with stories. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="328">Q: True. </sentence><sentence id="329">True. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="332">A: Hitler and Hitler did not have a reputation other than terrorism, cajoling, bullyism. </sentence><sentence id="333">He's the ultimate form of European bullyism. </sentence><sentence id="334">So my father comes <span class="building">home</span>; I am born. </sentence><sentence id="335">They decide they're going to go <span class="interior space">underground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="336">And one of the terrible things that also happens is that one considers the older people, the grandparents. </sentence><sentence id="337">What do they do?

you an idea of what it was like at the time that my parents made the decision to go <span class="interior space">underground</span> and to provide and look for a place for me. </sentence><sentence id="1741">On the fifteenth of November Eddie (which was my mother's other brother) visited us with great sadness because of what had happened to Father, Mother and our brother Jack. </sentence><sentence id="1742">During this visit he told us he had an underground address for Dad and myself and a separate one for you, Jack. </sentence><sentence id="1743">It's written for you because this whole manuscript was written for my brother and myself. </sentence><sentence id="1744">So that's the form it takes. </sentence><sentence id="1745">Very distressed with the idea of parting from our baby, Eddie tried to convince us that your chances, Jack were better without us. </sentence><sentence id="1746">If we were captured he explained at least you might survive. </sentence><sentence id="1747">He also knew it would be easier to find a separate place for a couple without children. </sentence><sentence id="1748">They would not bring to the underground family the additional burden and security risk of children crying or needing medical attention and such. </sentence><sentence id="1749">All night Eddie talked with us. </sentence><sentence id="1750">What an extraordinary demand -- give up our three month old child to perfect strangers and without opportunities to visit. </sentence><sentence id="1751">We had no idea how long such an arrangement would have to last, a month, half a year, longer, who knew. </sentence><sentence id="1752">The next day we talked with my brother Maritz. </sentence><sentence id="1753">In the serious way that's so typical of him he asked Dad and me to consider the following : imagine the German police catching you, he said, this could happen at any moment. </sentence><sentence id="1754">The baby will fall into their hands. </sentence><sentence id="1755">Wouldn't you rather have a child with Ollie and me (Ollie was his wife) until Eddie takes them to a hiding place? </sentence><sentence id="1756">Dad and I found a lot of truth in what he said. </sentence><sentence id="1757">Here was a chance so many people wanted but had no opportunity of getting. </sentence><sentence id="1758">How could we pass it up. </sentence><sentence id="1759">We felt that no matter what we did we would be doomed if we didn't do anything. </sentence><sentence id="1760">Already the families of several of our brothers and sisters had been torn apart by arrests and deportations. </sentence><sentence id="1761">A few months ago, Case, the husband of Dad's sister, Bepe, had been taken to <span class="populated place">Camp Westerbork</span> leaving Bepe at <span class="building">home</span> alone with their two year- old daughter. </sentence><sentence id="1762"><span class="populated place">Westerbork</span> was located

<span class="building">children's home</span> in which Femma worked was soon seized by the SS and the Green Police. </sentence><sentence id="1766">They captured the Jewish infants and sent them with their mothers to be gassed or destroyed in one way or another. </sentence><sentence id="1767">But Femma protected herself and her daughters and then found underground addresses for each of them. </sentence><sentence id="1768">This is my Aunt Femma who died a year ago. </sentence><sentence id="1769">She was very active in finding hiding places for children. </sentence><sentence id="1770">She was a very brave and very strong and feisty woman. </sentence><sentence id="1771">The thing is many people were brave and feisty and strong and everything but in some way it was luck. </sentence><sentence id="1772">It was luck that you survived but it didn't necessarily mean that you were lucky or that being lucky meant you were better than anyone else. </sentence><sentence

another brother, because he was involved with the resistance moved around from one temporary hiding place to another. </sentence><sentence id="1781">He never went permanently <span class="interior

was to be found with any choice we made we finally decided to go ahead with Eddie's plan. </sentence><sentence id="1792">He promised that within a week we would be told all the details. </sentence><sentence id="1793">This was the best of the worst of situations. </sentence><sentence id="1794">Maritz's wife Ollie also had to agree with the arrangement because she would be also responsible for caring for our son, me. </sentence><sentence id="1795">No one knew for how long. </sentence><sentence id="1796">It could take two days, it could take a month. </sentence><sentence id="1797">But Ollie agreed without talking to us. </sentence><sentence id="1798">It was good enough for her that my brothers wanted it. </sentence><sentence id="1799">We have always been grateful to her. </sentence><sentence id="1800">Ollie died two and a half months ago and I wrote her daughter and her step-daughters a letter saying something like this about what a decent person she was and how we owe our thanks to her and I wrote this letter as -- it was ostensibly a condolence letter but I wanted to say something to her daughters about what a fine person she was. </sentence><sentence

id="1805">They were fortunate for the moment because Shuls, one of their sons, one of my father's brothers, and his family lived nearby allowing them to help his parents through thick and thin. </sentence><sentence id="1806">But with his loving attention to them and his recent service period away from <span class="building">home</span> (he had to serve in the army) he hadn't been able to find an underground address. </sentence><sentence id="1807">The old people understood that for them life was finished. </sentence><sentence id="1808">One sees this now on the photographs taken of them for their identity papers. </sentence><sentence id="1809">Even if they went <span class="interior space">underground</span>, which seldom happened, their chance for survival was very slim. </sentence><sentence id="1810">As long as the war continued it became clear to them that they would eventually be left by themselves, most likely never again to be with the people they so dearly loved. </sentence><sentence id="1811">Often enough there was talk of the underground and so with great grief they began to live with it (meaning the children going underground). </sentence><sentence

night, he says, to begin with the first part of our journey into hiding. </sentence><sentence id="1838">As we had originally agreed he himself--------- (let's see if I can find the other piece of that). </sentence><sentence id="1839">Eddie himself would bring us. </sentence><sentence id="1840">Everything was planned that way. </sentence><sentence id="1841">Jackie, that's me, would be picked up by my brother Maritz at seven o'clock in the evening and from thereon a place would be found in the <span class="building">children's house</span> in <span class="populated place">Neimachen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1842">This was just as Eddie said it would happen from the agreed upon plans made earlier on. </sentence><sentence id="1843">We were expected to pay 300 guilder a month to the <span class="building">children's house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1844">We did just this even though in this time this amount of money was a large amount for working class people. </sentence><sentence id="1845">It was organized so that we would have a particular amount with us and Eddie would hold on to the rest. </sentence><sentence id="1846">In case something went wrong with us there would still be enough money for a definite time to pay the <span class="building">kinder house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1847">In the beginning we could know if we had enough money or not for the duration of the war. </sentence><sentence id="1848">We naively thought it would be possible. </sentence><sentence id="1849">As I have said as soon as I knew the plan that morning Chait ver

went <span class="interior space">underground</span> and you left you couldn't leave abruptly because then immediately someone would be on your tail so my parents planned this over time so they could slowly leave.. They would leave someone paying some of their bills and it would be months before it was realized that they were gone. </sentence><sentence id="1852">And my mother has often talked about how she felt she had to be like a criminal. </sentence><sentence id="1853">She had to think like a criminal because the law was in the hands of the criminals. </sentence><sentence id="1854">She as an ordinary person had to think like that to survive. </sentence><sentence id="1855">Dad was quickly warned at <span class="building">work</span> I do not know by whom. </sentence><sentence id="1856">At four o'clock he came <span class="building">home</span> which was very unusual for Thursday when he usually came <span class="building">home</span> about eight o'clock or later. </sentence><sentence id="1857">He just told his boss he had to go away for a little while. </sentence><sentence id="1858">Because it was so busy on Thursdays this boss told him to be quick and come back as soon as possible but Dad knew better. </sentence><sentence id="1859">He then went for the last time to his mother and father who were in a dejected mood and not without reason. </sentence><sentence id="1860">They had just before found out that their daughter Judith, her husband and child, Yope and Laney were betrayed and handed over to the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1861">We will never know if the Trompettor grandparents knew that Laney was in fact still with her benefactor having gotten away from her executioners. </sentence><sentence id="1862">This is my cousin Laney who lives in <span class="country">Holland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1863">I'm almost absolutely certain they did not know otherwise we would have heard it from Uncle Jules. </sentence><sentence id="1864">For Dad at the moment while this was indeed a grim message he tried not to be disheartened. </sentence><sentence id="1865">On the contrary this news of his sister strengthened him in his resolve to go into hiding. </sentence><sentence id="1866">In answer to your question about their character. </sentence><sentence id="1867">You never really know the full depth I suppose of your character until something extraordinarily intervenes and then if you're lucky you rise to the occasion. </sentence><sentence id="1868">Dad also told his parents what we were going to do that night but what could these poor people do but accept our leaving them. </sentence><sentence id="1869">This was the last time that Dad was ever again to be with his parents. </sentence><sentence id="1870">Here was the new episode between parents and children finished under the saddest of circumstances. </sentence><sentence id="1871">Still to come were many more moments of separation. </sentence><sentence id="1872">Dad came <span class="building">home</span> and told me that what he had just learned from his parents about his sister and her family. </sentence><sentence id="1873">I felt very sad but now realized that we had come this far and we definitely had to continue with our plans, the sooner the better. </sentence><sentence id="1874">And this of course then is my mother's moment when she too becomes resolute. </sentence><sentence id="1875">We ate something and got dressed as if we were going out. </sentence><sentence id="1876">We put on our best clothing because you never knew. </sentence><sentence id="1877">Seven o'clock in the evening November 20, 1942 my brother Maritz came to take Jackie away. </sentence><sentence id="1878">What This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1879">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1880"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection amoment. </sentence><sentence id="1881">Would we ever see you again?

pleased she did it but in reading it, it also pushes my button about what about me -- now. </sentence><sentence id="2131">Dad felt it was now time for him to begin his own search for you. </sentence><sentence id="2132">We are reading now about the part where my parents have been liberated and my parents decide to look for the children, to look for whatever children are still alive. </sentence><sentence id="2133">We had no idea how to do it. </sentence><sentence id="2134">We had no guidance but our patience was up and we could not wait for information that would inform us about what happened with you and Andy. </sentence><sentence id="2135">Because of the behavior of your step parents we later understood that they would not take any action making known that during the war-time they had hidden a child. </sentence><sentence id="2136">Many people like them were attached to the children in their care, very understandable. </sentence><sentence id="2137">The family De Chot presumed that Dad and I were no longer alive. </sentence><sentence id="2138">We now know that in our situation regarding you that you would have then been returned to us. </sentence><sentence id="2139">What happened during the war too is people did get attached to their children and there were many legal cases in <span class="country">Holland</span> after the war where the families who survived had to go to <span class="building">court</span> to get the children back. </sentence><sentence id="2140">The nature of some of these cases is very telling about Dutch ethics because after the war the way people survived was through the <span class="building">black market</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2141">There was no doubt about it, that's how you survived. </sentence><sentence id="2142">My mother feels embarrassed about it. </sentence><sentence id="2143">She thinks it's shameful. </sentence><sentence id="2144">She prefers I not saying anything about it but the fact is that's how people survived. </sentence><sentence id="2145">Gentile families who did not want to return their Jewish children would often use that as an argument why the parents were not responsible parents and could not have the children back and in many cases did not get the children back because of that. </sentence><sentence id="2146">Many of the people who hid the children also had a religious agenda. </sentence><sentence id="2147">They felt they needed to convert these children and it wasn't always a self-serving sentiment. </sentence><sentence id="2148">It was also the sentiment of how to save the children. </sentence><sentence id="2149">To convert them would be to save them, so it was mixed. </sentence><sentence id="2150">The reason there was a high percentage of Dutch Jewish children who were able to go <span class="interior space">underground</span> was because to save the people of the Book would be considered a mitzvah. </sentence><sentence id="2151">The Jews were known as the people of the Book and for many of the Protestants in <span class="country">Holland</span> they took their bible literally, it's interesting. </sentence><sentence id="2152">With Andy it would have turned out differently because his parents were no longer alive. </sentence><sentence id="2153">More about that later. </sentence><sentence id="2154">Dad didn't want to wait any more while the information just dribbled in and as I said went out on his own. </sentence><sentence id="2155">After enquiring he found out where to go to the <span class="building">military authorities</span> and get a special pass that allowed him to hitch rides on <span class="spatial object">military transport</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2156">There was no other <span class="spatial object">transport</span> at the time. </sentence><sentence id="2157">You didn't have <span class="spatial object">buses</span>, you didn't have <span class="spatial object">subways</span>, you didn't have zip. </sentence><sentence id="2158">This meant only <span class="spatial object">army vehicles</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2159">The fact is there simply wasn't any other <span class="spatial object">transport</span> yet. </sentence><sentence id="2160">Still this meant quite a bit. </sentence><sentence id="2161">Again Dad left the <span class="building">house</span> with nothing but a little money for necessities which themselves weren't easy to buy. </sentence><sentence id="2162">The military authorities gave Dad very good advice. </sentence><sentence id="2163">The told him he must begin his search north of the <span class="env feature">rivers</span> because <span class="country">Holland</span> is in the <span class="region">middle</span> divided by a bunch of <span class="env feature">rivers</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2164">Because there was known that in the province <span class="populated place">Overeisel</span> there were children who had been bought for hiding so the story goes light haired children above the <span class="env feature">rivers</span> which wasn't true of you at all. </sentence><sentence id="2165">What Celene is talking about is that the people who hid children during the war had a policy that dark haired Jewish children would go to the south of <span class="country">Holland</span> where most of the people were Catholic and were darker and the lighter skinned, lighter haired Jewish people would go to the <span class="region">north</span> because there were Protestants who were lighter. </sentence><sentence id="2166">So Dad began with the purpose in front of his eyes, good or bad from one empty <span class="spatial object">army truck</span> or another finally ending up in the <span class="populated place">city</span> of <span class="populated place">Naivadol</span> in <span class="populated place">Overeisel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2167">We had never heard of this place before. </sentence><sentence id="2168">Once in <span class="populated place">Naivadol</span> Dad immediately went to <span class="building">City Hall</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2169">There he spoke to several bureaucrats. </sentence><sentence id="2170">One of them, Mr.Bucker, sent Dad on the way to Mrs. De Fries Andy's foster mother on the large <span class="dlf">street</span> in <span class="populated place">Naivadol</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2171">The man knew that there was a young boy that had been hidden. </sentence><sentence id="2172">When he arrived at Mrs. De Fries's <span class="building">home</span> Dad was allowed in and saw to his stunned surprise a little boy of whom he though thought this could well be Andy, his nephew. </sentence><sentence id="2173">He had the family face and the age was also right. </sentence><sentence id="2174">Dad spoke with Mrs. De Fries. </sentence><sentence id="2175">He explained his relationship telling her his name This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="2176">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="2177"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection which at the moment was unknown to her. </sentence><sentence id="2178">After a while and for different reasons she understood that Dad was the brother of the mother of this child who she had taken over under her protection and who she was very fond of. </sentence><sentence id="2179">Dad was very lucky to have found Andy. </sentence><sentence id="2180">For Mrs. De Fries this was not a happy day. </sentence><sentence id="2181">Dad could see that it would not be easy to get Andy from her but that's a tale apart. </sentence><sentence id="2182">It got to be late in the day and thus Dad was invited to supper and slept there. </sentence><sentence id="2183">The few hours that were left Dad played with Andy. </sentence><sentence id="2184">Andy sat on Dad's lap and began to play with his ear lobe. </sentence><sentence id="2185">This was a habit that Dad's younger brother Yope one out of eight brothers and sisters always did as a little kid. </sentence><sentence id="2186">Mr. Bucker from <span class="building">City Hall</span> also knew to tell Dad that a few kilometers between <span class="populated place">Naivadol</span> and the <span class="populated place">town</span> of <span class="populated place">Chaino</span> stood an old small <span class="dlf">farm</span> where there was also a young boy brought underground. </sentence><sentence id="2187">He suggested that Dad should check this <span class="dlf">farm</span> out because that in any event he left Mrs. De Fries and planned to return for Andy. </sentence><sentence id="2188">She actually didn't give Dad any indication that she understood that she had to be separated from Andy at some point in the future. </sentence><sentence id="2189">Dad departed from Andy with mixed feelings from this complicated situation. </sentence><sentence id="2190">It was early in the morning when Dad continued his search for you. </sentence><sentence id="2191">He had to travel the long kilometers on foot. </sentence><sentence id="2192">He often said to me how he walked and walked and in the evening dead tired arrived somewhere on the side of a <span class="dlf">road</span> in the <span class="populated place">village</span> of <span class="populated place">Chaino</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2193">He rang the bell of the <span class="dlf">farm</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2194">It was already dark and about ten o'clock. </sentence><sentence id="2195">He waited for someone to answer the <span class="dlf">door</span> which didn't happen right away. </sentence><sentence id="2196">They were people who were used to going to <span class="spatial object">bed</span> early and they were by then fast asleep. </sentence><sentence id="2197">Dad kept ringing the <span class="spatial object">bell</span> and finally a man stuck his head out of the <span class="dlf">attic window</span> and asked what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="2198">In the hope that the sound of a child crying was your crying Dad screwed up his courage to begin a conversation with this man. </sentence><sentence id="2199">He told the man who he was and why he had come. </sentence><sentence id="2200">They didn't plan to open the <span class="dlf">door</span> right away answering Dad. </sentence><sentence id="2201">The child's parents died and that's why we took him through the intervention of our pastor. </sentence><sentence id="2202">At this point Dad asked to be let in, in any case. </sentence><sentence id="2203">He wanted them to know who he was by comparing something he had with him. </sentence><sentence id="2204">Oh I guess from reading this I see that they brought me to him that evening. </sentence><sentence id="2205">I thought that he slept over. </sentence><sentence id="2206">Dad was allowed in and right away showed the man a lamb's wool baby shirt because a similar one had been left with the baby boy when he was sent <span class="interior space">underground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2207">This was from the lamb's wool bathing suit that they had made. </sentence><sentence id="2208">The organization that provided contact with <span class="dlf">underground hiding places</span> had told the family to save it in case the child had to be brought to another place. </sentence><sentence id="2209">Luckily in your situation this advice was heeded. </sentence><sentence id="2210">After comparing the two pieces this was evidence enough that the truth was being spoken here. </sentence><sentence id="2211">Only then did they bring you forth, a crying young boy of about two years old. </sentence><sentence id="2212">Dad saw in the blink of an eye that it was his son. </sentence><sentence id="2213">What a moment it must have been. </sentence><sentence id="2214">It was and is to value how these people didn't clam up but in one night were made 100% certain before believing something of the parental bond that was being talked about here. </sentence><sentence id="2215">This is understandable. </sentence><sentence id="2216">Here I could write some things but that I won't and don't want to. [ </sentence><sentence id="2217">ll leave that to imagination. </sentence><sentence id="2218">The truth is I don't know what she's talking about here and I'd really be curious. </sentence><sentence id="2219">What Dad told me about this after he took you in his arms that is not to be described except by Dad himself. </sentence><sentence id="2220">And so that was the first contact for Dad with the family who played a large role in your and our lives. </sentence><sentence id="2221">After an emotional discussion Dad was allowed to sleep there overnight. </sentence><sentence id="2222">You and the family slept <span class="interior space">upstairs</span> while Dad was given a <span class="spatial object">hay mattress</span> and a small <span class="interior space">room</span> downstairs. </sentence><sentence id="2223">From everything that Dad could see these people were very simple farmers, in fact poor people who notwithstanding the poverty knew how to hold themselves together. </sentence><sentence id="2224">The family consisted of a sixty five year old man who looked like he was eighty. </sentence><sentence id="2225">His wife who was also in her sixties wore a wig which was very unusual in those years. </sentence><sentence id="2226">They had an unmarried son who was about twenty eight years old who could be mistaken for forty and an unmarried young daughter. </sentence><sentence id="2227">When I saw them later I could see that they were a very stiff but decent people. </sentence><sentence id="2228">When she says stiff she means that they were Dutch Reformed, very conservative. </sentence><sentence id="2229">The people were as good for you as they could be because with them there This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence

information about this collection was also great hunger which was readily apparent. </sentence><sentence id="2232">They had one horse and a few chickens left over. </sentence><sentence id="2233">The woman told Dad that her man still had to work on the <span class="env feature">land</span> for other farmers. </sentence><sentence id="2234">For this he would every day get a plate of oatmeal and once in a while an egg. </sentence><sentence id="2235">You Jack, would sit by him and he would share his oatmeal and egg with you. </sentence><sentence id="2236">Mrs. De Chot told how she took apart one of her <span class="spatial object">bedspreads</span> and used the thread to make a coverall for you because all of your clothes were too small. </sentence><sentence id="2237">She also said she cut the tips of your shoes off so that they would still fit.(Laughter) Remarkable. </sentence><sentence id="2238">You know I haven't read this in a few years. </sentence><sentence id="2239">This can be seen from a photo that she made of you, her son and herself. </sentence><sentence id="2240">When I look at the photo and when I had first seen it I had the impression that she had made this coverall for the occasion of the photograph for which she derived great pleasure. </sentence><sentence id="2241">I've never seen this photo. </sentence><sentence id="2242">Not knowing that she would have to give you up. </sentence><sentence id="2243">Later at our first meeting she said that she never would have given you up had it not been your real parents who claimed you. </sentence><sentence id="2244">She had planned to have you baptized but our appearance had prevented this. </sentence><sentence id="2245">Too bad I would have been covered there too. </sentence><sentence id="2246">There was no doubt at all that these people were very fond of you and the son played the role of father even more so than the older man. </sentence><sentence id="2247">This became quite clear later on. </sentence><sentence id="2248">The family came out of a Reform Protestant background. </sentence><sentence id="2249">They were very formal and lived just like Mrs. De Fries with her bible on the <span class="spatial object">table</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2250">Almost everybody in <span class="populated place">Overeisel</span> lived like this. </sentence><sentence id="2251">I just want to interrupt this reading by saying something that I have found out in the last half a year that there was in fact a group in <span class="country">Holland</span>, there was a group of young people, 17, 18, 19, 20 who were instrumental in providing hiding places for Jewish children like myself and this group was called the NV which literally translated means the unknown holding company, the <span class="building">anonymous holding company</span> which is a wonderful surrealistic title I think. </sentence><sentence id="2252">And my cousin Yanika from <span class="region">California</span> has been receiving this information and recently sent me an article about an older man who is very pivotal in this group who was captured and killed and in the article there is a list of children's names of their name, the date they were born and where they were hidden and my name is in there and I saw it and it was a remarkable experience to get this. </sentence><sentence id="2253">I called my cousin Yanika and I said to her I got this, this is wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="2254">And she says to me what did you feel like when you saw your name? </sentence><sentence id="2255">And I said well the truth is I felt wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="2256">It confirms all these things and I said and how did you feel and she said well I wept and I wept and I wept. </sentence><sentence id="2257">She is 57 so she's older than me and she remembers our grandparents. </sentence><sentence id="2258">She remembers going out every day when she was hidden <span class="interior space">underground</span> waiting for her parents to come back so she has that experience. </sentence><sentence id="2259">But for me it was a remarkable experience to see my name Isaac Trompettor and then <span class="populated place">Overeisel</span> which is the <span class="region">province</span> where I was and then a question mark next to <span class="populated place">Overeisel</span> that may mean we don't know where in <span class="populated place">Overeisel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2260">It was a stunning experience for me to see that and it was all the result of me spending the last years of searching this out. </sentence><sentence id="2261">I know my parents were very resistant to that for a long time and I feel very vindicated that I pursued this and stayed with it, that I got this. </sentence><sentence id="2262">It's very important to me. </sentence><sentence id="2263">I would emphatically encourage other people who have similar or like stories to do that. </sentence><sentence id="2264">When you do find out real documented pieces of what you've always heard in your family it's emotionally very fulfilling and powerful. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2425"> A? </sentence><sentence id="2426">Sure. [ </sentence><sentence id="2427">ll just read this last page. </sentence><sentence id="2428">In the few days that it was necessary for Dad to stay there, there was so much conversation from which Dad had heard that in the beginning there was also another young boy about twelve years old who they also hid. </sentence><sentence id="2429">Mrs. De Chot had noticed that when she was away and came <span class="building">home</span> to you, you were crying and the young boy had frightened you and the crying got worse instead of better. </sentence><sentence id="2430">It turned out that he would light the <span class="spatial object">stove</span> and put me head first into the <span class="spatial object">stove</span>, this boy. </sentence><sentence id="2431">I'd rather not believe it but it was enough for them to This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="2432">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence

id="2434">So I can imagine seeing this other young Jewish kid who was out of his mind and took it out on me. </sentence><sentence id="2435">He had to go somewhere else and who knows what happened to this boy. </sentence><sentence id="2436">I think this accounts for some of my having a nervous breakdown after the war, being fricasseed. </sentence><sentence id="2437">Now it was time for Dad to figure out how to come <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2438">He knew that I didn't know what was going on nor did he have an opportunity to inform me. </sentence><sentence id="2439">You know there were no <span class="spatial object">phones</span> then that were working. </sentence><sentence id="2440">The next morning Dad went to the <span class="building">church</span>, spoke with the pastor. </sentence><sentence id="2441">What Dad told him was sufficient enough for Dad to take you without any official authorization. </sentence><sentence id="2442">The <span class="building">church</span> had a lot of influence with people. </sentence><sentence id="2443">You could go to the <span class="building">church</span> and make it clear to them you were the parent and the <span class="building">church</span> would go to the people and talk to them and convince them. </sentence><sentence id="2444">From there we went to the <span class="building">local military authority</span> who provided him with a transportation pass so that when <span class="spatial object">transport</span> went <span class="region">south</span> both of you could go on it. </sentence><sentence id="2445">It took four That's my Mom.jpgThat's my Mom.jpgdays before an empty <span class="spatial object">truck</span> came your way. </sentence><sentence id="2446">Those four days were actually very necessary because you two got to know each other. </sentence><sentence id="2447">The morning when the <span class="spatial object">truck</span> arrived Dad and you left for <span class="populated place">Tilburg</span> promising the De Chots to keep in touch and he would let them know how you were doing. </sentence><sentence id="2448">Naturally we kept our word. </sentence><sentence id="2449">We did. </sentence><sentence id="2450">We were in touch and visited those people up until we went to <span class="country">America</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2451">It was also the time at least according to my parents that they got to be very pushy and obnoxious about wanting to convert me. </sentence><sentence id="2452">I suspect that this was not entirely so and maybe what my parents had to flush out in order to make the necessary separation from these people. </sentence><sentence id="2453">I mean it's complex and subtle stuff with this last little chapter. </sentence><sentence id="2454">What Dad clearly remembers about this trip was that as long as the ride took, you sat in your wet pants on his lap and he got wet, too. </sentence><sentence id="2455">You also cried often during the trip. </sentence><sentence id="2456">How could it be otherwise sitting in the <span class="interior space">back</span> for hours with the feeling of wet pants, no food or drink, as well as the crowding of many other people around you. </sentence><sentence id="2457">While you possibly had been so used to the quiet all of a sudden such a huge change. </sentence><sentence id="2458">I have often thought about this especially if I had been the one to carry you instead of Dad. </sentence><sentence id="2459">I have also often thought about how I would have felt if I had been the one to see you first at the <span class="populated place">De Chots</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2460">To understand that I could see you in front of me to spoil you and take you with me. </sentence><sentence id="2461">What would that have felt like? </sentence><sentence id="2462">This will always be a question. </sentence><sentence id="2463">The other question that should always be a question and unfortunately didn't get addressed in our family was what was it like for me to be adopted
