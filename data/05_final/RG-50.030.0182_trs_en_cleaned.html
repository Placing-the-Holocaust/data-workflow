<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: Could you tell me your name please? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: My name is David Pollack. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7">Q: And where and when were you born? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9">A: In <span class="populated place">Prince Albert</span>, <span class="region">Saskatchewan</span>, in 1922. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="11">Q: Tell me something about your parents and the <span class="populated place">town</span> in which you grew up please. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="13">A: My father came to <span class="country">Canada</span> in 1913 from <span class="country">Russia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="14">He was an indentured worker. </sentence><sentence id="15">Someone paid his fare across and he worked off this fee and then had a few hundred dollars and asked the man who had brought him over to find a place in <span class="country">Canada</span> where with $300 he could buy a <span class="building">business building</span>, <span class="interior space">room</span> overhead where he could live and enough money left: over to bring in his fiancee. </sentence><sentence id="16">They only place in <span class="country">Canada</span> where that would qualify was a little <span class="populated place">village</span> called <span class="populated place">Kenistino</span> (ph), <span class="region">Saskatchewan</span>, a <span class="populated place">village</span> of 400 people then and I think 400 people now, where there happened to be a <span class="building">store</span> with a <span class="interior space">room</span> overhead and the whole thing including my mother's air fare, air fare - sea fare, was less than $300. </sentence><sentence id="17">So my brother and sister and I were born and brought up in this little <span class="populated place">hamlet</span> in <span class="region">northern Saskatchewan</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="23">Q: What was it like growing up in that <span class="populated place">town</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="25">A: It was very healthy. </sentence><sentence id="26">It was a simple childhood. </sentence><sentence id="27">You, you were concerned with the weather and wheat and trying to, my father trying to sell the merchandise that in his little tiny <span class="building">store</span>. </sentence><sentence id="28">Most of it wasn't actually sold. </sentence><sentence id="29">Most of it was bartered because money was rare in the 30's when I remember the <span class="building">store</span>. </sentence><sentence id="30">The farmers would bring in butter and eggs and cheese and furs and and roots so they would dig up herbs. </sentence><sentence id="31">I remember one called <span class="dlf">seneca root</span> (ph) which you could make into some kind of over-the counter drug, and my father would look at these things and say they're worth such and so and then that person would take the groceries and my father would send these things then on to <span class="populated place">Prince Albert</span> which was then a <span class="populated place">city</span> we would call it of five thousand, and so the family survived and my brother and I were sent to <span class="building">University of Saskatchewan</span> and my sister when she graduated from grade 12 was sent to <span class="populated place">New York</span> to my mother's sister so that she could marry a nice Jewish boy, of which there were none in <span class="populated place">Kenistino</span>. </sentence><sentence id="32">We were the only Jewish family there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="41">Q: What was it like to be the only Jewish family? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="43">A: Since I didn't, since I didn't know anything else it seemed perfectly normal. </sentence><sentence id="44">Everybody was the only family there the only Ukrainian, the only Slavic, the only whatever. </sentence><sentence id="45">People had to get along. </sentence><sentence id="46">There was no fire system. </sentence><sentence id="47">There was no police system. </sentence><sentence id="48">There was a municipal doctor, which meant he had an enormous <span class="region">territory</span> to travel so it wasn't wise to have, to revive old world animosities of religion, race, color or creed. </sentence><sentence id="49">People of course couldn't  eliminate their prejudices, but everyone tried to get along, and so while my father would tell me you are Jewish and you must behave and not do things that will not be right, I didn't really know what that meant until I left Kenistino at age 17 to go to the <span class="building">University of Saskatchewan</span>, which was in a <span class="populated place">city</span> called <span class="populated place">Saskatoon</span>, and I really have not encountered anti- Semitism in my life. </sentence><sentence id="50">I can't say I've never because it's impossible not to encounter, but it's been minimal, perhaps because I don't think in those terms. </sentence><sentence id="51">I guess because of my childhood, so I knew I was Jewish but I didn't really know what that meant and it didn't trouble me. </sentence><sentence id="52">And certainly doesn't trouble me today. </sentence><sentence id="53">01:04 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="65">Q: You went to <span class="building">University</span>. </sentence><sentence id="66">Was that: a radical change for you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="69">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="70">It was a big change because this little <span class="populated place">village</span>, <span class="populated place">Kenistino</span>, had minimal infrastructure. </sentence><sentence id="71">It had no running water. </sentence><sentence id="72">It had outdoor <span class="building">outhouses</span> and in twenty below and thirty below and forty below, the typical prairie winters, something that I I'm glad I don't have to do to this day. </sentence><sentence id="73">Electricity came into <span class="populated place">Kenistino</span> when I was in <span class="building">junior high</span>. </sentence><sentence id="74">Before that we studied with coal oil lamps and we, with little felt wicks, and there were no such a thing as <span class="spatial object">television</span> of course. </sentence><sentence id="75">The <span class="spatial object">radios</span> were poor. </sentence><sentence id="76">We had no newspaper. </sentence><sentence id="77">So <span class="building">University</span> was an amazing change as the studies let alone the <span class="populated place">city</span> of <span class="populated place">Saskatoon</span> was a major change for me. </sentence><sentence id="78">So I spent two years there and then I enlisted at age 19, just going on 20, because everybody was doing that and it was, as we now would call it, it was a good war and of course Hitler was something that the the Jewish people would talk about a lot in the <span class="env feature">prairies</span>. </sentence><sentence id="79">I might just say a word about the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="80">Since <span class="region">Saskatchewan</span> is a very large <span class="region">province</span>, peopled, dotted with tiny <span class="populated place">hamlets</span> and <span class="populated place">towns</span> and <span class="populated place">villages</span>, the Jewish people would meet once a year for the high holidays in one <span class="populated place">village</span> or another, by some pre-arranged system and hold the services without a rabbi but with a local cantor. </sentence><sentence id="81">And they would pray and then they'd meet in the one Jewish woman's <span class="building">house</span> and they'd eat and the men would talk politics and talk about Zionism and play cards and go <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="82">So although each <span class="populated place">village</span> had one or perhaps two Jewish families, they retained a sense of being Jewish without having Cheders or anything. </sentence><sentence id="83">I was bar mitzvahed but it was rather odd. </sentence><sentence id="84">My father sent me to another <span class="populated place">village</span> twenty-five miles away every Friday night to memorize my bar mitzvah ceremony. </sentence><sentence id="85">I didn't know what I was saying but I said it. </sentence><sentence id="86">My dad and mother cried copiously and everybody was happy and so there there was a sense of Jewishness but it was an arms-length sense. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="106">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="107">You enlisted in the army when? </sentence><sentence id="108">In what year? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="112">A: I enlisted in the <span class="building">Air Force</span> in 1942. </sentence><sentence id="113">I was then 20. </sentence><sentence id="114">I enlisted when I was 19 but I didn't actually enter until I was 20. </sentence><sentence id="115">And I spent the first year and a half in <span class="country">Canada</span>. </sentence><sentence id="116">I enlisted in <span class="building">Air Crew</span> but I washed out because I wore glasses and my coordination with a helmet on wasn't  good, and at that time in the early 40's, if you enlisted in <span class="building">Air Crew</span> and then couldn't make it for reasons of of such a nature, you were given the first option to enter this new and secret world of <span class="spatial object">radar</span>. </sentence><sentence id="117">The reason was that you could advance more rapidly and it was a little bit more exciting than being ground crew and just repairing <span class="spatial object">air planes</span> and doing ground duties. </sentence><sentence id="118">So I was allowed, I was offered the course in basic radar and I liked it very much. </sentence><sentence id="119">My mind works along lines of mathematics and I was commissioned after my eight months of of study and sent to an <span class="env feature">island</span> off the <span class="region">west coast</span> of <span class="country">Canada</span> at the <span class="region">southern point</span> of the <span class="populated place">Queen Charlottes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="120">There's there's an <span class="env feature">island</span> about the size of a <span class="dlf">city block</span> on which the Canadian's authority, military authorities, had put a <span class="building">radar station</span>. </sentence><sentence id="121">From <span class="region">Alaska</span> to <span class="populated place">Baca</span> (ph), <span class="region">California</span>, the Canadians and Americans had interlocking circles such that the <span class="spatial object">Japanese ships</span>, <span class="spatial object">submarines</span>, and <span class="spatial object">aircraft</span>, if they came towards the <span class="dlf">coast</span>, would be spotted by this radar system. </sentence><sentence id="122">And the one I was sent to was part of this interlocking grid of radar networks. </sentence><sentence id="123">And I was the junior of two officers. </sentence><sentence id="124">I was what is called a pilot officer. </sentence><sentence id="125">It's equivalent in the Army to 2nd Lieutenant, and the commanding officer who was a flying officer of 1st Lieutenant's rank, and I were, constructed and put into operation this radar system. </sentence><sentence id="126">We had 40 young Canadians absolutely isolated from civilization in a <span class="env feature">rock</span> in the middle of the <span class="env feature">Pacific Ocean</span>. </sentence><sentence id="127">No women, no movies, no liquor, no nothing. </sentence><sentence id="128">Just a <span class="building">radar station</span>. </sentence><sentence id="129">It wasn't, it wasn't exactly what I thought a war would be. </sentence><sentence id="130">Nothing every happened. </sentence><sentence id="131">The Japanese didn't come so it was boring and yet we we were supposed to keep these 40 young men up to operational efficiency at all times, when their thoughts were on other things -wine, women and song - I know because I had to, I had to what is the word - read their mail to make sure that they didn't pass on any secrets, but they didn't talk about radar. </sentence><sentence id="132">They talked about other more basic things. </sentence><sentence id="133">Anyhow, after six months I thought you know this is ridiculous and I volunteered to go overseas and so | arrived overseas and spent about a year in <span class="country">England</span> before D Day. </sentence><sentence id="134">My work in <span class="country">England</span> was mostly on radar-controlled <span class="spatial object">anti-aircraft</span>. </sentence><sentence id="135">We were trying to shoot down the buzz bombs or the <span class="spatial object">V-l bombs</span> by radar and also of course when the <span class="spatial object">German bombers</span> would come over. </sentence><sentence id="136">And also I spent six months in the <span class="region">North</span> 01:10 <span class="env feature">Sea</span> out of <span class="populated place">Yarmouth</span> on what were called HSL's - high speed launches. </sentence><sentence id="137">The RAF and the American Air Force, the Canadians were always part of the <span class="building">RAF</span> or attached to the <span class="building">RAF</span>, would go out to bomb in the morning and afternoon and come back and there would be these fights over the <span class="env feature">North Sea</span> and when one of our <span class="spatial object">air craft</span> was shot down, if someone in our <span class="spatial object">bomber</span> could get a fix, a coordinational fix back to the <span class="building">intelligence headquarters</span> in <span class="populated place">London</span>, that person would look on a big map and see where we were anchored in our launches, and then send a a message by radio - there's an <span class="spatial object">aircraft</span> down or going down in your <span class="region">quadrant</span>. </sentence><sentence id="138">try and find it. </sentence><sentence id="139">And if it was daylight the skipper with his binoculars would would go towards where he thought the <span class="spatial object">bomber</span> might be. </sentence><sentence id="140">If it became dusk and we were getting close then it would be my job to turn on the <span class="spatial object">radar</span> which had a very high frequency low scan so that we  could we could see into the <span class="env feature">water</span>'s edge and the job was to find these <span class="spatial object">aircraft</span> and pick up the pilots which were very rare vintage because they were very rare commodity. </sentence><sentence id="141">They were being shot down so quickly by the Luftwaffe (ph). </sentence><sentence id="142">So for about a year I was in <span class="country">England</span> doing these things on the <span class="env feature">land</span> with buzz bombs, shooting down buzz bombs, or on the <span class="env feature">sea</span> trying to find <span class="spatial object">aircraft</span> and and pilots in their <span class="spatial object">lifeboats</span> with my radar. </sentence><sentence id="143">And that was my job until D Day when - dates are a little fuzzy now in my mind - but I would say perhaps a week or ten days after D Day, I was asked, or not asked, I was told to go across the <span class="dlf">channel</span> with a <span class="spatial object">mobile radar unit</span> to set up a mobile transmitting <span class="building">station</span> as close as possible to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="144">The reasoning was as follows. </sentence><sentence id="145"><span class="spatial object">Radar</span> was very primitive 45 years ago. </sentence><sentence id="146">Instead of having chips and the little tiny things we have today, they had huge what used to call them <span class="spatial object">bottles</span>, big tubes, glass tubes, and great big power packs. </sentence><sentence id="147">I mean you'd need a <span class="interior space">room</span> this size to power the <span class="spatial object">transmitters</span> in those days because they were so primitive. </sentence><sentence id="148">So inefficient. </sentence><sentence id="149">That being the case the closer the <span class="spatial object">radar unit</span> was to the <span class="spatial object">aircraft</span> that they were sending their impulses to the more accurate they'd be. </sentence><sentence id="150">I guess I should just explain that word impulse. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="191">Q: That's OK. </sentence><sentence id="192">I mean here we... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="195">A: Well but it might explain what I was doing. </sentence><sentence id="196">The Americans were bombing <span class="country">Germany</span> by daylight with a <span class="spatial object">bombsight</span> called Norden (ph). </sentence><sentence id="197">You actually looked down and the bombardier controlled the <span class="spatial object">airplane</span> in the run in over the <span class="dlf">target</span>. </sentence><sentence id="198">You looked at the target and twiddled knobs and you controlled the projectory of the <span class="spatial object">airplane</span>. </sentence><sentence id="199">So the Americans would bomb <span class="country">Germany</span> in daytime. </sentence><sentence id="200">The British and the Canadian and the Polish attached and the 01:14: Australians and the New Zeelanders attached to the <span class="building">RAF</span> bombed at night. </sentence><sentence id="201">And the way they could see see in quote marks the target was as follows. </sentence><sentence id="202">The heavy bombers the <span class="spatial object">Blenheims</span> (ph) and the <span class="spatial object">Wellingtons</span> the big <span class="spatial object">bombers</span> carrying the bombs would go out in units of I think it was ten or twenty. </sentence><sentence id="203">And in between waves of the <span class="spatial object">heavy bombers</span> would one or two <span class="spatial object">aircraft</span> that were called mosquitoes. </sentence><sentence id="204">They were made out of <span class="spatial object">plywood</span> and they flew at thirty thousand feet at three hundred miles an hour. </sentence><sentence id="205">They had no bombs. </sentence><sentence id="206">They had a radar set that you could see and hear and from the <span class="env feature">ground</span> we would control that navigator in the mosquito such that when he came Over for example the suburb of <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, we'd press a button, knowing~ where he was on our screen on the <span class="env feature">ground</span> in <span class="country">England</span>. </sentence><sentence id="207">He could hear and see what the signals we were, the impulses we were sending to him, and the bomb was dropped - not a bomb - a thermite (ph) bomb was dropped from the mosquito on a <span class="spatial object">parachute</span>, and that~ thermite bomb was brilliant, would, would stop "x" thousand feet above the <span class="env feature">ground</span> and remain suspended in the <span class="dlf">air</span> and then five minutes later this wave of ten or twenty <span class="spatial object">bombers</span> would come over and bomb the thermite flare. </sentence><sentence id="208">So you had had what was called twenty-four hour service. </sentence><sentence id="209">The Americans bombing in day, the British bombing at night, and the radar controlling the British night bombing. </sentence><sentence id="210">And the farther you were from the <span class="spatial object">aircraft</span> that you were sending the impulses to, the weaker were the impulses and the more likely you'd get distortions on the screen or in the headset. </sentence><sentence id="211">So that's why they sent our mobile teams across the <span class="dlf">channel</span> after D-Day to get closer and closer to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> so that we could guide the <span class="spatial object">night  bombers</span> from <span class="country">England</span> on to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> while the Russians were coming in from the other side. </sentence><sentence id="212">So I was sent with this <span class="spatial object">mobile radar unit</span>. </sentence><sentence id="213">I think we were twenty or thirty or forty people, with the with the <span class="spatial object">radar equipment</span>, and we set course towards <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> - I don't remember the <span class="populated place">cities</span>. </sentence><sentence id="214">I remember <span class="populated place">Aachen</span> - A - A - C - H- E- N. [remember <span class="building">Dueren</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="215">I remember <span class="populated place">Weimar</span> and I certainly remember <span class="populated place">Mons</span> (ph) in <span class="country">Belgium</span> where we bivouacked. </sentence><sentence id="216">And we were on our way to I don't know where, when an American came towards us on a <span class="spatial object">motor cycle</span>, an MP I 10 guess, and I was in the lead <span class="spatial object">jeep</span> with my flight sergeant. </sentence><sentence id="217">I was all of 23 then. </sentence><sentence id="218">1945. </sentence><sentence id="219">And I guess my sergeant was the same age, and this American comes up side and he said you guys ever seen a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>? </sentence><sentence id="220">I had heard the phrase, but I thought being rather ideologically simplistic - I was from the <span class="env feature">prairies</span>. </sentence><sentence id="221">I had had two years at <span class="building">University</span> and then I was in the service, so I really hadn't thought about such things. </sentence><sentence id="222">I'd read whatever newspapers I was given, but I thought that they were our propaganda system and their propaganda system, and we had stories about <span class="populated place">camps</span> and tortures and so forth, but I hadn't really given much thought. </sentence><sentence id="223">I said to the sergeant, let's see what he means by this phrase. </sentence><sentence id="224">And the American said its "x" kilometers down the <span class="dlf">road</span>. </sentence><sentence id="225">It's called <span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span>. </sentence><sentence id="226">And that's how I came to enter <span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span> I think a day or half, a day or two days after it was liberated by, if my memory's correct, the American 3rd Army, | think. </sentence><sentence id="227">But that's how I came to <span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="263">Q: Tell me your impressions as you walked through the <span class="dlf">gates</span>? </sentence><sentence id="264">What did you see? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="267">A: Well, there were inmates milling around. </sentence><sentence id="268">There were some soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="269">The inmates, there was a triage system under way. </sentence><sentence id="270">Those who clearly were beyond any hope, or those who were dead or those who were clearly beyond any hope, were, were in one part of the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="271">Those that seemed quite in decent health, in good health, were being sent out as quickly as they could get <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> to take them out And in the remainder were, were there with doctors coming in 1:0 to look at them and see what they could do. </sentence><sentence id="272">I saw the piles of, of dead bodies. </sentence><sentence id="273">They were stacked in the way you stack <span class="spatial object">beer bottles</span> in the in the <span class="spatial object">refrigerator</span>. </sentence><sentence id="274">You know, you put the head and then the bottom of the <span class="spatial object">bottle</span>, and then the front of the <span class="spatial object">bottle</span> and the rear of the <span class="spatial object">bottle</span> so that you can, they'll s1.ack without rolling over. </sentence><sentence id="275">They were stacked with legs spread apart and heads put in so that you could get bodies, a large number of bodies in a <span class="spatial object">pile</span>. </sentence><sentence id="276">There was a <span class="spatial object">furnace</span> with one of the <span class="dlf">doors</span> open and the remains of a body in it. </sentence><sentence id="277">There were <span class="dlf">scaffolding</span> and piles of bones and of course the inmates themselves. </sentence><sentence id="278">I went into one <span class="building">building</span> where a number of men were lying on lhe <span class="env feature">ground</span>, on the <span class="interior space">floor</span> of this <span class="building">building</span>, which was very dirty with excrement. </sentence><sentence id="279">I was then smoking and I had this sweet capprel (ph) cigarettes which was a British cigarette in hard paper cover with silver foil, and I was smoking cigarette after cigarette because the smell was, the stench was very strong, and one of the inmates who was lying on the <span class="env feature">ground</span> signaled for ;I cigarette and I had three left and I sort of tossed them and I didn't want to get too close because I didn't know about typhus or I, I didn't know about the medical side of things, and they took out the three cigarettes and divided them and then they began to have a little jostling for the silver foil. </sentence><sentence id="280">I guess it represented something of value after years of no value. </sentence><sentence id="281">It was a very, very disturbing sight to, to see them wanting this little piece of paper just because it seemed to have some value, monetary value Anyhow they would make V signs to us, and they smiled, those who had strength. </sentence><sentence id="282">They, I took photographs. </sentence><sentence id="283">I took a number of photographs, which I've given  to the <span class="building">Holocaust Memorial Museum</span>, of the <span class="spatial object">furnace</span>, of the <span class="dlf">scaffolding</span> where they would hang people, of the bones, of the people stacked on the <span class="env feature">ground</span> and being carted away in some kind of <span class="spatial object">truck</span> or horse-driven <span class="spatial object">carriage</span>. </sentence><sentence id="284">I don't remember which. </sentence><sentence id="285">I remember that the men's thighs were so thin that you could almost put~ my hand around it, it was just bone there. </sentence><sentence id="286">The flesh had literally melted away. </sentence><sentence id="287">You could put your hand around the tops of their arms. </sentence><sentence id="288">Their faces were this wax, this yellow waxy face. </sentence><sentence id="289">The skin <span class="spatial object">W21S</span> drawn so tightly around the <span class="spatial object">skulls</span> that they almost just: looked like, like skulls with tissue paper around them. </sentence><sentence id="290">It was a very shocking sight.particularly my sergeant threw up. </sentence><sentence id="291">I didn't throw up. </sentence><sentence id="292">I guess it was because it came as such an amazing blow you might say. </sentence><sentence id="293">I, I repeat I was ideologically very simplistic. </sentence><sentence id="294">I had never thought about such things happening. </sentence><sentence id="295">They hadn't entered my my mind in <span class="region">Saskatchewan</span> and in the early years of the my war time activity which were very occupied with technical problems and then drinking beer and going out with women. </sentence><sentence id="296">I didn't I didn't think about ideology and philosophies of government and the racial thesis and things like that. </sentence><sentence id="297">So it was very, it was like somebody had struck me, but I, I, I wasn't as physically upset as my driver who wasn't Jewish and I guess it wasn't until the next day when the enormity of the thing came to me. </sentence><sentence id="298">I had a little diary that periodically I'd enter things, and I entered a couple of pages, which I think I've also given to the Memorial li...<span class="building">library</span>. </sentence><sentence id="299">But clearly it was a very mammoth and, and disturbing event to a young, young kid. </sentence><sentence

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="340">A: Well, I, I had to go on. </sentence><sentence id="341">I wasn't a flea agent. </sentence><sentence id="342">I had my orders to be at such and such a point at such and such a time, but I wanted to do something and since I only spoke English I found a prisoner who spoke many languages and I said in the RCAF, Royal Canadian Air Force, attached to the RAF, the British Royal Air Force, officers have the right to send a little blue V mail, air gram letters, and when we sent them they'd go by <span class="dlf">air</span> to where ever. </sentence><sentence id="343">Enlisted men might go by <span class="env feature">air</span> or might not go by air depending upon <span class="interior space">space</span>, so that was a privilege that British officers had. </sentence><sentence id="344">So I said to this inmate who spoke many languages, look, I can't remain here long, and yet I'd like to do something. </sentence><sentence id="345">If you will find some prisoners, some inmates who have friends or relatives around the world, if you will give me the inmate's name and his friend or relative's name and address, I'll send a little one paragraph, two sentence letter saying I have seen your friend or relative. </sentence><sentence id="346">He will soon be at a <span class="populated place">displaced persons camp</span> in such and such. </sentence><sentence id="347">Send him money or passports or food or clothing as soon as possible. </sentence><sentence id="348">That inmate lined up a number of people. </sentence><sentence id="349">I don't know how many because I did this twice, once at <span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span> and once a week later at a <span class="populated place">DP camp</span> that I subsequently passed. </sentence><sentence id="350">And I would say I wrote between one and two dozen letters -I'm not sure on the number all over the world, to <span class="country">Turkey</span>, to what was then <span class="country">Palestine</span>, now <span class="country">Israel</span>, to <span class="country">England</span>, several to the <span class="country">United States</span>, one to <span class="country">Canada</span> which I'll mention in a moment, simply saying I have seen your friend or relative names so forth. </sentence><sentence id="351">Send help to him care of <span class="populated place">DP camp</span> - I've forgotten the name of the <span class="populated place">DP camp</span> where I was told they would go - it was in <span class="country">Belgium</span> as quickly as possible. </sentence><sentence id="352">And then in each case I put, my address is Flying Officer D. H. Pollack, C29272 - that was my number - RCAF overseas. </sentence><sentence id="353">You can reach me at that address. </sentence><sentence id="354">I would be interested in knowing whether you have reached your friend or relative. </sentence><sentence id="355">So the whole letter was one paragraph with a little footnote. </sentence><sentence id="356">And away those letters went. </sentence><sentence id="357">And two weeks later some more went from this <span class="populated place">DP camp</span> that I visited. </sentence><sentence id="358">Some years later - I kept the names and addresses of some of them, and 25  years later I came across a folder with these, with some of them - oh no, I think, I'm sorry - my mind now is getting clear - some of them replied to me. </sentence><sentence id="359">And I kept those in a <span class="spatial object">folder</span>. </sentence><sentence id="360">That's it. </sentence><sentence id="361">And they simply said in varying degrees of, of excitement I received your note. </sentence><sentence id="362">I did contact my friend or relative. </sentence><sentence id="363">Thank you very much. </sentence><sentence id="364">In varying degrees of, of, of enthusiasm and warmth and emotion. </sentence><sentence id="365">And I didn't do any...you know, what would one do. </sentence><sentence id="366">I, I did what I could and I and I didn't I didn't want to intrude on people's lives, but twenty-five years later I came across | :his <span class="spatial object">folder</span> and decided to write to two or three of them to say I've just found your letter to me of 1945.It's now 1960 whatever, "63, "68. </sentence><sentence id="367">I'm curious to know whether the person that you told ME you had located is doing all right. </sentence><sentence id="368">Something like that. </sentence><sentence id="369">And I got two or three very fascinating letters. </sentence><sentence id="370">One if you'd like I'll tell you about. </sentence><sentence id="371">Evidently one of the persons, who couldn't speak English, said I have a relative in <span class="populated place">Windsor</span>, <span class="region">Ontario</span>, but I don't know his or her address. </sentence><sentence id="372">His name was Eisenberg (ph), I now find. </sentence><sentence id="373">I wrote to the Chief of Police in <span class="populated place">Windsor</span>, <span class="region">Ontario</span>, saying I have met a prisoner in whether it was <span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span> or the <span class="populated place">DP camp</span> I've forgotten. </sentence><sentence id="374">He or she, he needs help immediately and doesn't know his relative's address. </sentence><sentence id="375">Could you try to locate a mister, I think it was <span class="building">Hiam Eisenberg</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="376">The constable or the Mounties, I don't know who, put a little note in the <span class="populated place">Windsor</span> newspaper and through that newspaper note, they located the relative who got in touch with Mr. Eisenberg in <span class="country">Europe</span> and they wrote to me from <span class="populated place">Windsor</span> saying thank you. </sentence><sentence id="377">We've, we've seen your letter from the Chief Constable of <span class="populated place">Windsor</span> and we have made contact and bless you and, and that was that. </sentence><sentence id="378">Many years later I decided to write and see whether Mr.Eisenberg was still in <span class="populated place">Windsor</span> and low and behold, he replied, saying I have never forgotten you because first of all you were an Ally, secondly you were an officer, thirdly you were Jewish, and for me this was, this was momentous. </sentence><sentence id="379">And I'm now in <span class="populated place">Windsor</span> and I opened a little <span class="building">air conditioning store</span> and I married in <span class="country">Europe</span> and I have three Canadian children and we're doing well and we're very happy. </sentence><sentence id="380">When the <span class="building">Holocaust Memorial Museum</span> found out about the photographs that I had taken at <span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span>, they asked if I had other mementoes additional to the photographs. </sentence><sentence id="381">And I took out these letters and sent them; including Mr. Eisenberg's and then I thought I should tell him I've done this, because after all it was a letter to me. </sentence><sentence id="382">He said of course you can send them to the <span class="building">Museum</span>. </sentence><sentence id="383">Then he wrote me a second letter, which I've also given to the <span class="building">Museum</span> saying I must tell you of an odd occurrence in <span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span> he said. </sentence><sentence id="384">I was handy with...1 was working in a some kind of <span class="building">foundry</span>. </sentence><sentence id="385">My number was, and he mentions his six digit number in the letter, but he said when I forged the new one I put the letter P, capital P, in front of it because I had noticed that prisoners who had a P in front of their number were less likely to be killed than those who didn't. </sentence><sentence id="386">He said I wasn't killed, and to this day I think Lt had to do with the letter P which I think meant either political or Polish. </sentence><sentence id="387">I received that letter, sent it on to the <span class="building">Holocaust Memorial Museum</span>, and ten days ago driving from <span class="populated place">Ottawa</span> to <span class="populated place">Washington</span>, my wife and I get these reading tapes - you put them in your <span class="spatial object">car</span> and a book is read to you - and this particular book was about a woman who had been in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, <span class="populated place">Dachau</span> and a third <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="388">And she mentioned the letter P as meaning political or Polish and being sort of a talisman (ph) so what Eisenberg had suspected as a thesis in fact was correct and so his life presumably was changed by this, this quirk of fate. </sentence><sentence id="389">I called the <span class="building">Holocaust Memorial Museum</span> to say I was sending them this fascinating letter and suggested that they write to Mr. Eisenberg to get that little ID with the letter P on it. </sentence><sentence id="390">On such minuscule quirks one's life depends. </sentence><sentence id="391">It's really sort of mind boggling. ( </sentence><sentence id="392">Pause) Well, I have received letters from people in <span class="populated place">London</span> and <span class="country">Turkey</span> and in <span class="country">Israel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="393">I have a beautiful letter from someone in <span class="country">Israel</span> - two, two letters from what is now <span class="country">Israel</span>, one from <span class="region">New Jersey</span>,  one from the <span class="populated place">Bronx</span>. </sentence><sentence id="394">Several from <span class="country">England</span>. </sentence><sentence id="395">And I've kept them. </sentence><sentence id="396">And I think they're now all in the custody of the <span class="building">Museum</span> and that was the little contribution that a, that a young kid was able to make to, to this Holocaust. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="544">Q: What happened, this communication obviously this has gone on for all these many years. </sentence><sentence id="545">Let us go back a little and ask what happened to Flying Officer Pollack at the end of the war? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="548">A: Well, I came back from the service in 1945 and finished my final work on a Bachelor. </sentence><sentence id="549">I had, had two years when I enlisted and I took another year and a half and got a bachelor's degree from the <span class="building">University of Saskatchewan</span>, and then was given a scholarship to study at the <span class="building">University of Chicago</span> in the <span class="country">United States</span> where I took my Master's and all of my Ph.D. excepting the thesis, and then was offered a, a, a job with the <span class="building">World Bank</span>, the International Bank for Reconstruction Development here in <span class="populated place">Washington</span>, and worked there for a couple of year; and then joined the <span class="building">United Nations Secretariat</span> and had a thirty year career in <span class="populated place">Washington</span>, in <span class="populated place">New York City</span>, in <span class="populated place">Mexico City</span>, in <span class="populated place">Santiago</span>, <span class="country">Chile</span>, and in <span class="populated place">Geneva</span>. </sentence><sentence id="550">Then I came back thirty years later. </sentence><sentence id="551">I married when I got the U.N. job, had three children and on taking early retirement in 1980, returned to <span class="populated place">Ottawa</span>, which was my wife's <span class="building">home</span>, and I've been a professor at <span class="building">Carlton University</span> in the <span class="building">School of International Affairs</span> ever since. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="556">Q: What effect has all of this had on you do you think? </sentence><sentence id="557">The experience in <span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span>, certainly the correspondence afterwards. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="560">A: Well, the initial effect was very powerful, very raw and very emotional to a young kid, but I think the effect on me, an odd way to put it is sort of been an intellectual one. </sentence><sentence id="561">I, all my career both in the <span class="building">United Nations</span> and teaching has been on how do systems work. </sentence><sentence id="562">What are ideologies of political systems and economic systems and how do they, how do you make them work, and the fact that the Nazis were able to design a philosophy and make it work so efficiently, there was based on extermination and torture and hatred and killing and superiority and inferiority of, of, of racial theories, the, the, the intellectual concept has stayed with me - how, how horrible it is and how easy it is to evolve systems that have such a blasphemous ideology and can be so efficiently run. </sentence><sentence id="563">This has stayed with me, so remember that my childhood was not that of a Jewish person, that is to say we were the only Jewish family and while I knew I was Jewish I didn't feel it sort of in through my chicken soup that Jewish children in a in a Jewish <span class="populated place">community</span> would feel. </sentence><sentence id="564">I knew I was Jewish but I didn't know anything whatnot. </sentence><sentence id="565">So that <span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span> had this first effect which was very raw as I say and it upset me. </sentence><sentence id="566">It just physically upset me, but afterwards it made me just aware of the horrors of being able to design and implement systems based on, on such a concept of human life and immorality and fear and hatred and finally this, this is what stays with me that <span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span> proved that you can do it. </sentence><sentence id="567">Do it well, from that point of view. </sentence><sentence id="568">As a matter of fact, not; don't I don't use such emotional words when I'm teaching, but I  0 do tell students in my first <span class="building">class</span> in the sessions when I teach development, the word development has been my life. </sentence><sentence id="569">And I say you know I, I do remember one thing. </sentence><sentence id="570">When I was a kid your age I say to the students, I'm, I'm fascinated how easy it was even for the Allies to take young people and put them in the same uniform, same haircut, same kind of shoes, same tie, and get them in a disciplined way to destroy, not with these horrible overtones of Nazis, but you can bring young people together to be disciplined to destroy. </sentence><sentence id="571">It's not hard. </sentence><sentence id="572">It's not hard to teach people to enjoy cutting down a big <span class="env feature">tree</span>. </sentence><sentence id="573">But how difficult it is to get people to join voluntarily to build and to develop it, to plant <span class="env feature">trees</span>. </sentence><sentence id="574">That thought has stayed in my mind all my life. </sentence><sentence id="575">Just that the Nazis carried it to a blasphemous and obscene result, but it is so easy to take young people and have them do things together in a tightly organized way, even though they, they want to be different. </sentence><sentence id="576">This has always been a big , a big paradox in my mind that it's easy to do to do that, so <span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span> just made me think very deeply about this paradox of civilization. </sentence><sentence id="577">How we can be Dr. Jekeyl's one moment and Mr. Hyde's the next. </sentence><sentence id="578">I may just on a somewhat lighter note, if you don't mind, I'd like to tell you the story of the <span class="spatial object">camera</span> that took the pictures that that I've been talking about. </sentence><sentence id="579">in my childhood in <span class="region">Saskatchewan</span>, it was quite common for teenagers to be given a rifle because we shot game, small game We would shoot crows because they would eat wheat, and we'd shoot gophers and bush rabbits because they'd eat wheat. </sentence><sentence id="580">So kids had a rifle, and I had a 22, and nobody thought about it. </sentence><sentence id="581">But when I was commissioned and went overseas the British gave officers in Europe, when we went across the <span class="dlf">channel</span>, gave officers side arms. </sentence><sentence id="582">We were gentlemen. </sentence><sentence id="583">We had side arms. </sentence><sentence id="584">And enlisted men, men had these big rifles, 303's. </sentence><sentence id="585">On our way to as close as we could get to <span class="populated place">Weimar</span> before coming to this incident with <span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span>, we spent a night at one of the many <span class="building">German guest houses</span> on the edge of the, the <span class="env feature">Black Forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="586">And there were these little round <span class="building">buildings</span> where people would rest their arms and shoot at I don't know what, game of some kind. </sentence><sentence id="587">So I asked my Flight Sergeant if after dinner he would come with me and help me regain my use of a of a powerful rifle. </sentence><sentence id="588">Because I said you know if there are Germans hiding in the which we were told there were. </sentence><sentence id="589">It was the end of the war and many Germans had taken refuge, refuge in this big <span class="env feature">forest</span>, being fed and protected by the civilians. </sentence><sentence id="590">If there are Germans there and if for some reason they decide to shoot at us, my little side arm, my little <span class="spatial object">popgun</span>, wouldn't be worth anything at ten yards. </sentence><sentence id="591">So I'd just like to practice again with a, with your 303, which is a big rifle. </sentence><sentence id="592">I think it was a <span class="building">Lee Enfield</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="593">So he said OK, and after dinner we went out. </sentence><sentence id="594">It was six o'clock or seven o'clock. </sentence><sentence id="595">It was good light, and I took this big rifle. </sentence><sentence id="596">They, they have a recoil so you push them up against your shoulder ad I put my elbow on the little <span class="dlf">window</span> and he said you see that <span class="env feature">tree</span> down there - I guess it was ten yards or whatever - see if you can hit it. </sentence><sentence id="597">So I aimed and pressed the trigger twice, and whap, whap this these bullets - I, I hit the <span class="env feature">tree</span>, and I turned to him you know with great pride saying you know, that just shows you I hadn't forgotten. </sentence><sentence id="598">And out from behind the <span class="env feature">tree</span> come two German officers, who had been hiding. </sentence><sentence id="599">They didn't know we were there. </sentence><sentence id="600">We didn't know they were there. </sentence><sentence id="601">But they thought that we'd seen them and were shooting at them, and came towards us and one pulls off a dagger or a little short sword and hands it to the Flight Sergeant saying something in German which we assume was don't, here, this is a bribe, and the other takes a little <span class="spatial object">icon camera</span> off his neck and hands it to me. </sentence><sentence id="602">Then we didn't know what to do with these two guys, so we phoned and an American military policeman came and took them away with great joy and I ended up with a camera. </sentence><sentence id="603">And I got film and I think it's sort of fitting retribution that the pictures that I took and which are now with your  1 <span class="building">Museum</span> were taken with a liberated German camera although it was humorous in the, after the event, but this, this was the way I, I got a camera to take the pictures that I did. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="648">Q: Is there anything you want to add, anything that comes back to you ? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="650">A: No, I don't think so. </sentence><sentence id="651">I hear in <span class="country">Canada</span> and in the <span class="country">United States</span> people saying it never happened. </sentence><sentence id="652">The Holocaust never happened. </sentence><sentence id="653">The <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span> never happened and I know they happened, because I was in them albeit only for a few hours. </sentence><sentence id="654">I'm coming to the latter stages of my career and life and I have been involved with development I think perhaps as, well come to think of it maybe as a psychological antidote to destruction. </sentence><sentence id="655">Maybe if you think about these things and you're in very formative years you've spent three or four years destroying things and seeing such things as <span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span>, you, you want to build you know. </sentence><sentence id="656">You feel a compulsion to develop things, not to knock them down. </sentence><sentence id="657">The war and <span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span> stay in my mind because I'm an economist and I work on the link between economic growth and social equilibrium and political stability and I wonder whether we can maintain a world in which these kinds of occurrences, the war and the the <span class="populated place">Buchenwalds</span>, won't happen again. </sentence><sentence id="658">So I think that it's admirable that your <span class="building">Holocaust Memorial Library</span> will be a place where young people and not young people can see and hear and read these things and not, not for not for emotional reasons. </sentence><sentence id="659">I've tried not to be emotional today. </sentence><sentence id="660">I, I haven't used my <span class="spatial object">folders</span> or my letters. </sentence><sentence id="661">As a matter of fact nobody even knew they existed until Hiam Bookbinder found out about them from, from one of the few people who ever saw them. </sentence><sentence id="662">So my reason for being so happy to give what I have and tell what I have to the <span class="building">Museum</span> is not an emotional reason, to arouse emotions and passions but to have people think about these things so they won't happen again. </sentence></p></dialogue>
