</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="141">A: I guess the overwhelming feeling was of fear for my father, fear for what's going to happen to us. </sentence><sentence id="142">I had forgotten until a few days before our interview, as I started thinking about those years and those times, how terribly fear dominated our lives were. </sentence><sentence id="143">How easy it was to control whole populations by terror in those days. </sentence><sentence id="144">And I as a 12 year old kid was simply scared of what's going to happen to us. </sentence><sentence id="145">But as soon as the Soviets walked in, they ostenaciously opened the <span class="building">schools</span> again. </sentence><sentence id="146">And we were...the same teachers were permitted to continue to teach and we were allowed to return to <span class="building">school</span>, encouraged to return to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="147">New subjects were introduced. </sentence><sentence id="148">Russian. </sentence><sentence id="149">Ukrainian since this part of <span class="country">Poland</span> was...uh...a majority of population was Ukrainian. </sentence><sentence id="150">And we were...back in <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="151">Now in retrospect I see how terribly...uh...disturbed I was by the events because my grades plummeted. </sentence><sentence id="152">I was bring nothing but <span class="dlf">Ds</span> and Cs from <span class="building">school</span>, and I was an A student before. </sentence><sentence id="153">Uh...Psychologists will tell you this is the first sign that something is wrong with a kid when he doesn't get good grades in <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="154">Uh...But obviously we were in..in...in great fear for what's going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="155">In the meantime, we received a post card from our father saying that he is interned in a little <span class="populated place">town</span> in <span class="country">Hungary</span> called <span class="populated place">Yur</span> (ph) where Polish armies that after they could no longer fight the Germans and Soviets, they crossed to <span class="country">Hungary</span> and were interned there under rather benign conditions because Hungarians, even though the government was collaborating, with the Nazis, the...the population...Hungarians were friends. </sentence><sentence id="156">We were permitted by the authorities to send a <span class="dlf">wire</span> to my father...in German, and to this day I remember the text of the <span class="dlf">wire</span>. </sentence><sentence id="157"><span class="building">Gesei Gesunt</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="158">We are healthy. </sentence><sentence id="159">We are well. </sentence><sentence id="160">That's all we were permitted to say in that <span class="dlf">wire</span>. </sentence><sentence id="161">And...uh...that's all we heard from my father for...for a very, very long time. </sentence><sentence id="162">Uh...In the meantime, the <span class="building">Russian school</span> continued. </sentence><sentence id="163">My mother was teaching....uh...sometimes some of our teachers had to be one lesson ahead of what they were teaching us. </sentence><sentence id="164">But we heard rumors that this is not going to last, this peace between the Germans and the Russians, although the Russians dismissed this propaganda and didn't...didn't allow it to...to...to be officially stated. </sentence><sentence id="165">And...uh...I may not recall anything from that period, except that I, of course, had many Jewish friends in <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="166">And uh, we were so involved in our own little world. </sentence><sentence id="167">Uh...The boys were talking about sex serupticiously. </sentence><sentence id="168">We were organizing <span class="building">poetry circles</span>. </sentence><sentence id="169">Uh...We were exchanging letters. </sentence><sentence id="170">We had <span class="building">school</span> mail where we would write letters to each other and..uh.. And then (pause) in June of 41, Hitler attacked <span class="country">Russia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="171">And within a day or 2, Soviets withdrew from the <span class="populated place">city</span>, but first blowing up and devastating most of the important facilities in the <span class="populated place">city</span>, such as a <span class="building">power house</span> and a lot of other installations. </sentence><sentence id="172">And the German, Nazis returned. </sentence><sentence id="173">And that is really when the terror started in earnest. </sentence><sentence id="174">The rumors started circulated that the Nazis are going to declare a...a day of liberty quote unquote for the Ukrainian population to settle the score with the Jewish population. </sentence><sentence id="175">And to our horror one day came and suddenly there were pogroms everywhere with the Ukrainian peasants coming into <span class="populated place">town</span> and beating and murdering Jewish families and...and...uh..and we, of course, stayed <span class="building">home</span> petrified and  just didn't get out. </sentence><sentence id="176">Uh...At that time, the economic situation also changed. </sentence><sentence id="177">We started feeling a dearth of food and supplies. </sentence><sentence id="178">We started getting hungry. </sentence><sentence id="179">Everything was disrupted. </sentence><sentence id="180">The...the normal functioning of the society was reduced to the minimum and everything was being...uh..collected, confiscated by the Nazi authorities to help their <span class="spatial object">war machine</span> drive into <span class="country">Russia</span>. ( </sentence><sentence id="181">Sigh) I heard numerous stories of what happened to my colleagues. </sentence><sentence id="182">Uh...I do not recall the details. </sentence><sentence id="183">It was too scary to even listen to, but I heard about my...one of my friends, Romack (ph), whose parents and...and sister were killed by the...and I'm not even sure by whom. </sentence><sentence id="184">And then he pleaded with them, "Kill me too. </sentence><sentence id="185">You killed the rest of my family." </sentence><sentence id="186">That's the only detail that I remember. </sentence><sentence id="187">We were getting...uh...progressively more and more...uh..desperate. </sentence><sentence id="188">The only way to survive was to take our possessions, whatever we had and whatever a Ukrainian farmer wanted and trade it for food. </sentence><sentence id="189">I remember through a friend we traded a <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> that my father had for 20 kilograms of Swani (ph), the pork fat or whatever it was. </sentence><sentence id="190">People were trading <span class="spatial object">furniture</span>, taking them to the <span class="populated place">village</span> and getting some grain. </sentence><sentence id="191">I remember a grinding, ordinary grain in a <span class="spatial object">coffee grinder</span>, mixing it with water and salting it a little bit and baking it on top of the..the <span class="spatial object">gas burning stove</span> and that would be our food. </sentence><sentence id="192">So it was really hard. </sentence><sentence id="193">So then we decided that we have to get back to <span class="region">central Poland</span> where my mother's sisters lived and where it would be easier to survive and have help from the two...two sisters and their families. </sentence></p></dialogue>

</sentence><sentence id="757">I made it to a lovely, colorful, untouched by war, just fabulously looking <span class="populated place">town</span> in <span class="country">Sweden</span> called <span

when my non-quota visa, immigrant visa was expiring. </sentence><sentence id="759">So I was lucky again. </sentence><sentence id="760">And, I met...I flew from <span class="building">New York LaGuardia Airport</span> to <span class="populated place">Detroit</span> <span class="building">Old Willowrun airport</span> and looked up my father in the telephone directory and it's a very funny feeling to find your father's name in a strange directory in a strange <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="761">And...uh...called his number. </sentence><sentence id="762">There was no answer and I stood at the <span class="spatial object">counter</span> not knowing what to do and I heard my name. </sentence><sentence id="763">He recognized me from the back. </sentence><sentence id="764">And I was a big strapping 6 footer at the age of 21.Uh...My mother came in May of that year, 85 officially. </sentence><sentence id="765">But my sister trying the same <span class="dlf">route</span>...uh...did not make it, was caught by the communists and imprisoned and eventually came to the <span class="country">United States</span> in 1958 when the conditions in <span class="country">Poland</span> under <span class="populated place">Gemolka</span> (ph) underwent a famous fall so they would permit families to reunite. </sentence><sentence id="766">Went to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="767">Decided to study law. </sentence><sentence id="768">Graduated in 56, and started a law practice with then my father-in- law in <span class="populated place">Polish-American community</span> on the <span class="region">west side</span> of <span class="populated place">Detroit</span>. </sentence><sentence id="769">In 62, I was contacted by a Congressman of Polish descent, John Dingle, and asked if I know of any identifiable Polish-Americans who would like to work on a <span class="building">foreign claimants settlement commission</span> in <span class="populated place">Washington</span> to assist in administering a program of adjudication of claims for properties lost in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="770">And after looking around I decided that I'm the one (laughing) for other reasons as well. </sentence><sentence id="771">So I accepted an appointment as a staff attorney on a <span class="building">foreign claims settlement commission</span> and worked on a Polish claims program for about 3 years. </sentence><sentence id="772">Within 6 months....no, I came in August of 62. </sentence><sentence id="773">By Spring of 63, I was being sent to our <span class="building">American Embassy</span> in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> to help run our <span

</sentence><sentence id="775">And for 3 months in 1963, I traveled through <span class="country">Poland</span> collecting documents...uh...seeking  5 evidence because our function was not simply to sit as a <span class="building">tribunal</span> and tell claims...show me, prove to me, but we were actively assisting them in this effort. </sentence><sentence id="776">And at that time I came in contact with a...a...personnel of the <span class="building">Jewish Historical Institute</span> in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>, and obtained from them a number of valuable documents and...and publications, some of which I have turned over to you for the...uh... <span class="building">Museum</span>. </sentence><sentence id="777">And it is that period of time that kind of gave me a broader perspective on the enormity of what happened between 1939 and 1945. </sentence><sentence id="778">Only then when traveling to little <span class="populated place">towns</span> and <span

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="810">Q: Do you hear personal testimony as well? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="812">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="813">Testimony was, in most cases, limited to description of <span class="dlf">property</span>, possessions, but in many situations the survivors of those years...uh...who came to the <span class="building">commission offices</span> here in <span class="populated place">Washington</span> testified as to their...uh..experiences during the Nazi's occupation. </sentence><sentence id="814">And I'm sure the records of the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission, the so-called Polish Program have that testimony and they're probably in the U.S. Archives. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="818">Q: How did you...you first. </sentence><sentence id="819">How did you handle all of this? </sentence><sentence id="820">How did you feel when you...your seeing these people and dealing with these people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="824">A: First, I wanted to do a good job. </sentence><sentence id="825">First, I wanted justice done. </sentence><sentence id="826">I did want to make sure that if there is any doubt, that doubt should be resolved in favor of the survivors. </sentence><sentence id="827">There were other families. </sentence><sentence id="828">We were, after all, involved in a rather futile attempt to at least compensate materially for the...the enormity of evil that happened to these families, both Jewish and Polish. </sentence><sentence id="829">Unfortunately, under American law, we had the obstacles, such as citizenship at the time of loss. </sentence><sentence id="830">And many, many people did not meet the requirement of <span class="country">U.S.</span> citizenship by the time of loss occurred. </sentence><sentence id="831">We could not grant compensation award reparations to peoples who were not American nationals or citizens at the time the loss occurred. </sentence><sentence id="832">I remember distinctly one decision which I, myself, was very pleased about...uh...because we applied a legal principal that permitted granting reparations to a much greater number of people rather than if we simply applied the official date of confiscation of the...of the <span class="dlf">property</span>...uh...by the communists regime. </sentence><sentence id="833">We used the concept of loss of use and enjoyment. </sentence><sentence id="834">Very often, communists in their profidious manipulation of the records and...and the law would leave the title and people, but would so restrict the rights of the owners or the ...uh...benefits that owners would derive from ownership of the property that for all intents and purposes, these people had all the burdens without any benefits. </sentence><sentence id="835">A  6 <span class="building">rental property</span> for instance. </sentence><sentence id="836">So we then developed the concept that it was the loss of use and enjoyment of the <span class="dlf">property</span> rather than the passage of title to the state that determined when people lost their possessions. </sentence><sentence id="837">And that's how we were able to...to award compensation to people who otherwise would not have gotten it. </sentence><sentence id="838">On a deeper level (Pause) ....Dr. Kuzmack, it's very hard to think of those times without projecting on those times, what I feel today. </sentence><sentence id="839">We all evolve and we all become much more sensitized and much more aware of...uh...the measure of tragedy than at the time that we are involved in the mechanics or addressing this or that narrow issue. </sentence><sentence id="840">I cannot really tell how I felt about it because honestly the same goes for my life. </sentence><sentence id="841">Today, I think I'm a much more aware person. </sentence><sentence id="842">I'm much more in touch with my emotions than at that time. </sentence><sentence id="843">That's an honest answer. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="864">Q: Is there anything you would like to add? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="866">A: I felt a regret at times and I have tried to put it to rest because it was a naive regret that had I been older maybe I would have been able to do more when I saw inhumanity and evil of those years. </sentence><sentence id="867">At the same time, I'm...I'm honest enough to admit that it's a...it's a hope tinged with fear because I wonder how many of us would have lived up the ideal of really disregarding our own safety and our own obligation to our loved ones to help a fellow man. </sentence><sentence id="868">How many of us would really live up to this principle when tested? </sentence><sentence id="869">I think there is a awareness in <span class="country">Poland</span> today which I sense from letters from relatives and friends and visits from friends and relatives...uh...what...what a great loss <span class="country">Poland</span> suffered because of the extermination of its Jewish population. </sentence><sentence id="870">As a child, as a youngster, I read...uh..some of the greatest poets and writers of <span class="country">Poland</span> who were Jews, Julian Tooly (ph) and...and so many others. </sentence><sentence id="871">Uh...<span class="country">Poland</span> is impoverished. </sentence><sentence id="872">To what extent it could have been prevented or its...its enormity limited, who's to judge? </sentence><sentence id="873">I just hope that in my own generation and in my own family and in my own children...uh...not only I hope but I make sure that there is awareness of the fact that we're all brothers and sisters, that we're all...to the extent that we discriminate or deprive of rights another human being, we do it to ourselves. </sentence></p></dialogue>
