<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: Tam Ruth Krautwirth Meyerowitz. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7">Q: And where and when were you born? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9">A: I was born in <span class="populated place">Frankfurt</span>, <span class="country">Germany</span>, in 19290 -- June 23, 1929. </sentence><sentence id="10">My father was born in <span class="country">Slovakia</span> -- what became Slovakian during the Second World War; and he came to <span class="country">Germany</span> when he was about two years old. </sentence><sentence id="11">And he was, I'm sorry to say, in the Austrian Army during World War I. And my parents were married in 1927. </sentence><sentence id="12">My father had just started a <span class="building">business</span>, and he was in leather good business. </sentence><sentence id="13"><span class="populated place">Frankfurt</span> is -- the Jews in <span class="populated place">Frankfurt</span> -- many Jews in <span class="populated place">Frankfurt</span>, were in the leather good business actually, across the <span class="env feature">river</span> in <span class="populated place">Offenbach</span>. </sentence><sentence id="14">And then during the war, he had to leave the <span class="building">business</span> in <span class="populated place">Offenbach</span> and move, to move the <span class="building">business</span> into <span class="populated place">Frankfurt</span>. </sentence><sentence id="15">Was behind in the, in the <span class="populated place">commercial district</span>, behind the main <span class="building">railroad station</span>. </sentence><sentence id="16">And I have a younger brother, four years younger. </sentence><sentence id="17">He is now -- he now lives in <span class="region">New Jersey</span>, too. </sentence><sentence id="18">And I live in <span class="region">New Jersey</span>, of course. </sentence><sentence id="19">And in 1933 --I have memories from the events, the chaotic events that went on in <span class="country">Germany</span> in 19-- from 1933, probably 1932 on. </sentence><sentence id="20">But, of course, the -- I understand, going back into history, that there was a lot of continuous up--- unrest in <span class="country">Germany</span>, from the end of the war actually and through the Depression and all this. </sentence><sentence id="21">But actually on account of the inflation. </sentence><sentence id="22">But I'm, of course, was too young to know of anything. </sentence><sentence id="23">I have memories from when I was about two, three years old. </sentence><sentence id="24">The first thing that I remember, was that there was sort of unrest and fear in the <span class="env feature">air</span>. </sentence><sentence id="25">And one day, my parents went out and left me with help. </sentence><sentence id="26">And I was worried because everything seemed so insecure all at once. </sentence><sentence id="27">So and we lived in an <span class="interior space">apartment</span> about on the <span class="interior space">third floor</span> which is probably is.... And I went out on the <span class="interior space">balcony</span> and looked for my parents. </sentence><sentence id="28">And of course, when you're that age I don't think you have any depth perception. </sentence><sentence id="29">And there was a <span class="spatial object">banner</span> slung between the two <span class="building">apartment buildings</span> and to me it seemed like it was a <span class="dlf">barrier</span> that no one would be able to cross anymore, and I was very fearful that my parents would not be able to come back to me. </sentence><sentence id="30">It was a <span class="spatial object">banner</span>; it was political banner that was put up by the Nazi party. </sentence><sentence id="31">I don't know what, I don't remember what it said. </sentence><sentence id="32">But that was my very first memory of Nazi, the rise of the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="33">My uncle, my father's youngest brother, was a budding reporter as they would say in today's jargon, and he worked for a <span class="building">German newspaper</span>. </sentence><sentence id="34">Apparently had written something or maybe, I don't know, maybe his political views were not anything the Nazis liked. </sentence><sentence id="35">Anyway, he was hunted, hunted down. </sentence><sentence id="36">He was taken to a -- he was, at first he was working on the <span class="building">newspaper</span>. </sentence><sentence id="37">And one day my father -- and I was three years old -- my father told, told me that, "If some men come and asked you where Uncle Julius is, you should tell them that you had just seen him this morning or the night before or some such." </sentence><sentence id="38">Because he wanted to sort of cool his <span class="dlf">trail</span>. </sentence><sentence id="39">If he had left by then, he was fleeing from the Nazis and made his way to <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>, and sure enough some men came, and I was really itching to tell them  that my uncle wasn't here, but thank God they never asked me. </sentence><sentence id="40">They just spoke to my father. </sentence><sentence id="41">They wanted to know where my uncle was, and he ended up in <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>, and they never caught him until much later. </sentence><sentence id="42">He was working in <span class="region">western part</span> of <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> in <span class="populated place">Pilsen</span> and when the Nazis came in, of course he tried to make his way east, away from them, and he went by <span class="spatial object">motorcycle</span> and had an accident, had a broken leg and brought him to the <span class="building">hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="43">And of course by then the occupying Nazi, Nazi forces -- the German army, knew who he was and they took him out of the <span class="building">hospital</span> and took him to <span class="building">jail</span> and he was shot there. </sentence><sentence id="44">So they did eventually catch up with him. </sentence><sentence id="45">So these were my very earliest memories of living in a <span class="populated place">police state</span> in <span class="country">Nazi Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="46">When, of course in the very beginning they -- the Nazis did now allow any money to be paid out or whatever foreign money or any monies were in <span class="spatial object">Jewish bank accounts</span> was stopped. </sentence><sentence id="47">Of course they had to open the accounts again especially since my brother was getting money from out of the <span class="country">country</span> foreign exchange with better interest. </sentence><sentence id="48">Which they were anxious to get in because they needed it, so it seemed that for a very short time life might be fairly normal in a large <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="49">It wasn't in the small <span class="populated place">cities</span>. </sentence><sentence id="50">There was a lot of beating and harassment of Jews of all kinds, but in a <span class="populated place">city</span> like <span class="populated place">Frankfurt</span>, it didn't quite begin. </sentence><sentence id="51">I didn't feel it until much later, but gradually they encroached on our liberties. </sentence><sentence id="52">I was walking with my family on the side of a <span class="dlf">park</span> once, and a young boy on a <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> knocked me over and went over my knee. </sentence><sentence id="53">He didn't break anything, but my parents were even afraid to go to the <span class="building">police</span> and report it, report it to anyone because it would only have meant problems for us. </sentence><sentence id="54">So since I wasn't seriously hurt they took me <span class="building">home</span> and nursed my knee and that was it. </sentence><sentence id="55">When, sometime ago, my family -- my sons, my husband and I -- went back to <span class="populated place">Frankfurt</span> on a sort of very bittersweet tour, we -- 1 wanted to show them the Jewish places and the rich Jewish history, if anything could be found -- the places that I remembered and the places that made sense within Jewish history to them. </sentence><sentence id="56">And we were walking from the last <span class="interior space">apartment</span> where we had lived, on the way to where my <span class="building">school</span> was. </sentence><sentence id="57">This <span class="building">school</span>, incidentally, was a rather well-known <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="58">The educational process is still being studied today. </sentence><sentence id="59">They were very progressive. </sentence><sentence id="60">It's Philantropin -- I don't know if you've heard of it but it was a really well known <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="61">And anyway, there was a few <span class="dlf">blocks</span> walk to the <span class="building">school</span> from my first <span class="building">house</span>, and we passed a <span class="building">house</span> that has been left standing, and it brought back a terrible memory of something that had happened. </sentence><sentence id="62">There was a little girl in my brother's <span class="building">class</span>. </sentence><sentence id="63">She was four years younger, I mean he's four years younger than I, so she was, must have been the same age as my brother. </sentence><sentence id="64">And she was, I don't know, maybe at the time eight or seven or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="65">Her father had done something that the Nazis didn't like, and so rather than punish him outright, they took this little girl and had her sterilized, and then returned to the father. </sentence><sentence id="66">And that is, I mean, a much more terrible thing. </sentence><sentence id="67">Now that I have grandchildren and I see my sons having their daughters almost that age, this is a most terrible thing that you can do to a parent. </sentence><sentence id="68">It's worse than taking and chopping a parent's hand off or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="69">And  we passed this <span class="building">house</span> and I told them the story and it was absolutely -- they were absolutely stunned. </sentence><sentence id="70">I mean they had heard and read every-everything about the Holocaust and about the persecutions and all, but standing in front of the <span class="building">house</span> where this actually went -- where this girl actually had lived, it was really quite mind-boggling. </sentence><sentence id="71">And of course eventually, everyone was killed anyway, but this was one of the terrible things that went on as the war progressed and as the war against the Jews progressed. </sentence><sentence id="72">Actually the war against Jews didn't really start in <span class="country">Europe</span> in 1939. </sentence><sentence id="73">It started in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="74">It became a hot war in 1933, but I think German history is, is full of war against Jews, cold and hot and in between. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="141">Q: Let's get back to you. </sentence><sentence id="142">How, what were you doing this years? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="145">A: I was going to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="146">Many of the teachers left. </sentence><sentence id="147">Many of them committed suicide. </sentence><sentence id="148">They were disillusioned with what was, and they were afraid of the future and when I've gone back to the <span class="dlf">cemetery</span> and I've seen some of their <span class="dlf">graves</span> and they are all, they all fall in this in a certain time period. </sentence><sentence id="149">It must have been at one point the realization that everybody would be killed and people preferred to die in their own <span class="spatial object">beds</span> and by their own choice. </sentence><sentence id="150">And so I do go the <span class="dlf">cemeteries</span> and I recognize some of the names and I put a stone and I remember what has happened. </sentence><sentence id="151">But, I did go to <span class="building">school</span> and many of my friends left. </sentence><sentence id="152">And then more and more restrictions were placed on Jewish teaching. </sentence><sentence id="153">We were allowed -- I mean -- I guess they couldn't control that we were learning Hebrew and the Bible and Jewish history and.... But we were not allowed to play Jewish music by Jewish composers and it was very funny. </sentence><sentence id="154">My -- when the <span class="building">school</span> stopped, my brother and I took violin lessons. </sentence><sentence id="155">Pretty bad, we were pretty bad. </sentence><sentence id="156">But anyway when -- after we were not allowed to go to <span class="building">school</span> anymore, my mother wanted us -- to keep us busy I guess, to keep practicing. </sentence><sentence id="157">And we were playing together the Barcarole from Tales of Hoffman and for some reason some Nazis, Gestapo men, came up to see us for I don't know what. </sentence><sentence id="158">And they heard us scratch away on the <span class="spatial object">violin</span> and they asked us what we were playing, and we were afraid to say that this was by a Jewish composer. </sentence><sentence id="159">Of course, <span class="populated place">Offenbach</span>" was not allowed to be played. </sentence><sentence id="160">Neither was Mendelssohn" and all the other Jewish composers or even if they were remotely related to Jewish composers. </sentence><sentence id="161">Because I guess they figured I couldn't -- we couldn't do much harm with our playing so they didn't say anything. </sentence><sentence id="162">But that was one of the many harassments that went on. </sentence><sentence id="163">Our <span class="building">school</span> was finally combined with the -- another <span class="building">school</span>, we -- one of the two <span class="building">Jewish schools</span> in <span class="populated place">Frankfurt</span> that had existed from -- for at least 100 years. </sentence><sentence id="164">I mean students had left, and there were very few left behind, and then of course some were sent out on <span class="spatial object">transports</span> into --we didn't know, but it was ostensibly, of course, for repatriation into the east or for <span class="populated place">settlement</span> in the <span class="region">east</span>. </sentence><sentence id="165">And of course that was not true, but we were told that that's what it  was. </sentence><sentence id="166">They -- when my good friend Irma was taken away -- and many, many of our -- of my friends and then the <span class="building">school building</span> was closed and we had classes for a very short time in the an old <span class="building">orphanage building</span>, the <span class="building">Jewish orphanage building</span>. </sentence><sentence id="167">And then of course, <span class="building">school</span> was stopped completely. </sentence><sentence id="168">And because my father was a Slovak citizen, and because he had -- his business was taken over by a German Nazi. </sentence><sentence id="169">He was a dentist, and he we think that he was an executioner because whenever the grapevine said that there had been some kind of shooting of German dissidents, he was away from the business. </sentence><sentence id="170">And he walked around, with a gun, he had a gun in my father's <span class="spatial object">desk</span> and whenever he called my father in for consultation, he would open the <span class="spatial object">drawer</span> and they, the conversation would go on over a gun sitting in the middle of my father's <span class="spatial object">desk</span>. </sentence><sentence id="171">And so he wanted to keep my father because this man knew absolutely nothing about running the <span class="building">business</span>, so he wanted to keep my father on. </sentence><sentence id="172">My father had the choice of staying behind when we were supposed to be sent to the <span class="region">east</span>. </sentence><sentence id="173">And he could have stayed behind and just had his family go but he didn't want to do this. </sentence><sentence id="174">He thought he could protect us if he would come with us, and ironically, very sadly, he is the one who did not survive the war. </sentence><sentence id="175">My brother and my mother and I managed to scratch out of it and survive. </sentence><sentence id="176">So, because of that, we were among the last few full Jews -- I mean there were a lot of mixed marriages, and there were a lot of off-spring you know who were half Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="177">Those were -- some of them were let sent to <span class="populated place">Theresienstadt</span> after we left -- but we were among the full Jews the last few to be sent to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="178">Now the reason we were not put into -- and we were told we were not put into a <span class="spatial object">car</span> with the gas going -- was that we were such a small <span class="spatial object">transport</span> and it didn't pay for them to use up a whole lot of gas. </sentence><sentence id="179">So, they figured they'd send us into <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> and we would be somehow dead within a short time anyway, so they just shipped us over. </sentence><sentence id="180">And on the way to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, we were joined by a lot of Polish prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="181">But they were forced laborers, women, who were taken into <span class="country">Germany</span> when the Germans occupied <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="182">They were probably -- maybe they said they didn't like the food or they objected to something, and they were then taken to a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="183">So as we were going along, and we were only riding during the day because at night the <span class="spatial object">planes</span>, the <span class="spatial object">Allied planes</span> flew overhead and they didn't, and of course the <span class="spatial object">planes</span> had no way of knowing who was in there. </sentence><sentence id="184">If they thought that we carried ammunition they would bomb us. </sentence><sentence id="185">So they made us stay at night in different places, in <span class="building">prisons</span> and whatever along the way. </sentence><sentence id="186">And we did the few hundred miles to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> in, I think, something like seven days and no nights. </sentence><sentence id="187">But wherever we went, we picked up several prisoners and they -- non-Jewish prisoners -- and they went to <span class="populated place">camp</span> with us. </sentence><sentence id="188">But we were the last Jews, were about 37 of us. </sentence><sentence id="189">And as far as I know, only my mother and my brother and I, and one other young boy survived. </sentence><sentence id="190">And I think that was a pretty high percentage because if we had been gassed of course no one would have been alive from the <span class="spatial object">transport</span>. </sentence><sentence id="191">And at the -- when you arrived in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> -- with all the pictures that you see of the SS men with the dogs and a beautiful bright day in April.... We were taken away on the 19th of  April which was Hitler's birthday -- or the 20", or something. </sentence><sentence id="192">It was the 20th wasn't it? </sentence><sentence id="193">This was supposed to be a birthday present to the Fihrer," that <span class="country">Germany</span> would be Judenrein," and that was why they shipped, gathered us on the 19th of April. </sentence><sentence id="194">And it took us about a week to get there, and it was a beautiful, bright, lovely day. </sentence><sentence id="195">It seems almost impossible that something this horrible could go on in the world on a beautiful day like that. </sentence><sentence id="196">We saw my father, from far away, and that was the last I ever saw of him. </sentence><sentence id="197">And we went into <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="198">Our clothes were taken away. </sentence><sentence id="199">Our hair was shaved off. </sentence><sentence id="200">My brother stayed with us for a very short time -- was allowed to be in <span class="populated place">camp</span> with us. </sentence><sentence id="201">And then they decided that it wasn't moral for a young boy to live with all these women who would sometimes would be in the nude. </sentence><sentence id="202">But of course it was very moral for them to have us to get undressed and to parade in front of an SS officer or a few SS officers anytime they wished and anytime a whimsy struck them you know. </sentence><sentence id="203">But this was immoral and my brother was taken to the <span class="populated place">men's camp</span>, and he managed to live through it somehow and of course he survived. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="263">Q: You told me a story about your mother at the Selektion.deg Would you tell us about that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="265">A: When she saved -- when she pulled me away. </sentence><sentence id="266">I-- when I came to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, a few months later, I think, almost everybody became very sick. </sentence><sentence id="267">My mother had malaria too, but she never had typhus. </sentence><sentence id="268">I was the one who came down with typhus, and I have very little memory of what went on. </sentence><sentence id="269">But my mother dressed me every morning, took me out to this Zahlappell(r) -- which is the equivalent of roll call -- and dragged me to work so that I wouldn't be beaten or sent into the <span class="building">hospital</span> -- the <span class="building">barracks</span> which was, which was really a <span class="building">death barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="270">So my mother dragged me around, but of course I looked terrible. </sentence><sentence id="271">And there was the Selektion for the <span class="interior space">gas chambers</span> one time, and we were standing outside and this SS man told me to go in one direction and my mother into another because I looked so sick. </sentence><sentence id="272">And of course I was just wasting the food -- this 200 calories worth of food that they gave us everyday. </sentence><sentence id="273">So my mother pleaded with him and said that, well, I'm her child and she, can't she come with, can't I come with her? </sentence><sentence id="274">And he said, "No, but if you're so concerned about your daughter, go with her." </sentence><sentence id="275">And she was just about to do this, and, and one of the women, who was working in the <span class="building">barracks</span> -- I think she swept <span class="interior space">floors</span> and whatever and maybe cleaned the <span class="dlf">chimney</span>, the <span class="spatial object">stoves</span> and whatever other menial work, but she had some kind of protected position, whatever that was worth -- she sort of grabbed me under one arm and my mother grabbed my other arm, and we managed to walk away. </sentence><sentence id="276">We were not even stopped, and it was some kind of miracle that the SS man didn't notice that or, or pretended not to notice us. </sentence><sentence id="277">And just, and we just kept going and my life was saved that day. </sentence><sentence id="278">It was really the most amazing thing. </sentence><sentence id="279">I can't figure out. </sentence><sentence id="280"> Of course, I was sick and I don't know exactly what went on -- the excitement of the moment. </sentence><sentence id="281">But my life was saved that day </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="299">Q: Tell me more about what you remember about <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, please? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="301">A: Well, of course the first day we arrived my hair was shaved and we were standing completely in the nude and I was frightened. </sentence><sentence id="302">I was thirteen years old. </sentence><sentence id="303">I called my mother, and she answered me and I turned around to look for her, but I didn't recognize her because, of course, she had no hair. </sentence><sentence id="304">Was impossible to recognize her totally without clothes and without hair. </sentence><sentence id="305">And then, we were tattooed and of course was nothing like the, the disinfectant or anything put on the ta-- on the needles. </sentence><sentence id="306">Everybody's tattoo became slightly infected but it -- that stopped. </sentence><sentence id="307">And we were brought into <span class="building">barracks</span>, at first into the <span class="populated place">"A" camp</span> and then later on into the "<span class="populated place">B" camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="308">One of our first chores was -- they had -- the <span class="dlf">roads</span> in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> were terrible. </sentence><sentence id="309">They were muddy and then the mud dried. </sentence><sentence id="310">It was full of <span class="dlf">ruts</span>, so they had this big <span class="spatial object">steamroller</span>. </sentence><sentence id="311">But it wasn't propelled by steam, it was pushed by prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="312">It was tremendous and they filled it up with <span class="env feature">sand</span>. </sentence><sentence id="313">You had to fill it with <span class="env feature">sand</span>, so it would be heavy, and then someone had to go out and push it to even the <span class="dlf">road</span>. </sentence><sentence id="314">So, one of our first jobs was to fill this <span class="spatial object">steamroller</span> and then later on -- or whatever it was, it was a tremendous <span class="spatial object">roller</span> -- and then later on to push it across the <span class="dlf">ruts</span> to try and even out the <span class="dlf">road</span>. </sentence><sentence id="315">I don't think it was very successful. </sentence><sentence id="316">And one of our next jobs was to even out the <span class="dlf">road</span>, to dig out wherever the <span class="dlf">road</span> was higher and to fill in where the <span class="dlf">road</span> was lower. </sentence><sentence id="317">It really didn't make any sense because we dug parts of the <span class="dlf">road</span> out, filled in another <span class="dlf">hole</span>. </sentence><sentence id="318">And it seemed like this kind of work was designed to take our energy away and to make us weak. </sentence><sentence id="319">And I think that was the purpose, to demoralize us and to sap our strength. </sentence><sentence id="320">Then we were in a <span class="populated place">camp</span> -- in the <span class="building">barracks</span> and we had this horrible food. </sentence><sentence id="321">Where we had -- they once -- I don't know, a few times a week, maybe two or three times a week -- we had a slice of salami which was about an inch thick and sometimes it was liverwurst. </sentence><sentence id="322">And something that came out of rusty <span class="spatial object">barrels</span> -- it was called "tea" -- and sometimes they had soup. </sentence><sentence id="323">They made soup out of bean -- no some kind of turnips, that weren't even peeled and potato peels and the <span class="env feature">sand</span> wasn't washed off. </sentence><sentence id="324">And they just threw everything together, and even at times they emptied out bags that the people had brought food when they were taken on a <span class="spatial object">transport</span>, and were -- and it was -- sometimes these bags of food managed to get into the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="325">But it wasn't assorted, they just emptied everything into this <span class="spatial object">pot</span> of soup that they were cooking. </sentence><sentence id="326">We found combs and <span class="spatial object">compacts</span> and things like that sometimes in the soup, because they never bothered to assort it. </sentence><sentence id="327">And that was the food that we had. </sentence><sentence id="328">And it must have been just a few hundred calories a day because everybody was getting sick. </sentence><sentence id="329">One of the signs of malnutrition and vitamin deficiency is sores, and people had terrible sores which festered on their legs. </sentence><sentence id="330">It was just awful. </sentence><sentence id="331">And that was one of the things that you could be taken to the <span class="building">crematorium</span> for. </sentence><sentence id="332">As soon as someone had a sore like that, or the scratches from scabies that was a reason to be taken to the <span class="building">crematorium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="333"> Now I was very fortunate. </sentence><sentence id="334">I also had scabies at one time but somehow it didn't get into my face. </sentence><sentence id="335">It stayed on my body, and there was a Selektion and they didn't, that day, make us take off our clothes. </sentence><sentence id="336">So they didn't that I had scabies and that also saved my life. </sentence><sentence id="337">Now scabies can be cured with a few pennies worth of sulfur cream. </sentence><sentence id="338">But of course no one had it and they were not interested in saving anyone of course. </sentence><sentence id="339">They were interested in having people get sick and having people die or be in such condition that they would take them to the <span class="building">crematorium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="340">The <span class="building">crematorium</span> was just a few minutes away. </sentence><sentence id="341">We could see the <span class="dlf">chimneys</span> from wherever we were, and of course we could smell the gas when it was left, let out from the <span class="interior space">gas chambers</span>. </sentence><sentence id="342">And then we could smell the burning of the bodies, the human flesh burning. </sentence><sentence id="343">Then they cleared the <span class="dlf">grates</span> and we could hear the <span class="spatial object">grates</span> being cleaned and it's similar to what your own <span class="spatial object">oven</span> would be like when you move the <span class="spatial object">grates</span> around except in a much -- it was much noisier that we could hear all the way in the <span class="building">barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="344">And to this day when I clean my own <span class="spatial object">oven</span>, I am reminded of that noise of the cleaning of the <span class="dlf">grates</span> in the <span class="building">crematorium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="345">Well, we lived through the -- these times. </sentence><sentence id="346">I made friends with a girl from <span class="populated place">Salonika</span> and her sister. </sentence><sentence id="347">Her name was Nini Ben Mayoa(ph). </sentence><sentence id="348">She was about 18 at the time and her sister was a year or two younger. </sentence><sentence id="349">I had not even realized that the Nazis were trying to eliminate even the Jews of as far <span class="region">south</span> as <span class="country">Greece</span> and I understand. </sentence><sentence id="350">I saw -- I met people in <span class="populated place">Jerusalem</span> in 1981 who were from <span class="populated place">Rhodes</span> and they had done the same thing to the Jews from <span class="populated place">Rhodes</span>, and I really wasn't aware that they were doing. </sentence><sentence id="351">Well, anyway, the Greek girls were taken from their <span class="building">homes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="352">Most of them were from <span class="populated place">Salonika</span>. </sentence><sentence id="353">They were taken from their <span class="building">homes</span> and brought to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> and of course their parents either had been killed or they were left behind and were taken out another time. </sentence><sentence id="354">So I made friends with Nini Ben Mayoa. </sentence><sentence id="355">She was studying to be an opera singer, and to us at the time, when she sang, it was like the most beautiful thing you could ever hear. </sentence><sentence id="356">Maybe she had a beautiful voice. </sentence><sentence id="357">To me it now sounds like she really, you know, she was like an angel singing. </sentence><sentence id="358">And of course there were Jews from all over <span class="country">Europe</span> and every language was spoken in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> except English. </sentence><sentence id="359">And they didn't get as far to, to the English Jews yet. </sentence><sentence id="360">So all the -- they under- they realized that everybody in order to communicate -- and luckily they didn't stop that -- would speak in the language that she would know. </sentence><sentence id="361">Nini and I could communicate in English because I had studied English and so did she, and that was the only way -- the only language that the two of us had in common. </sentence><sentence id="362">Of course this was forbidden. </sentence><sentence id="363">So because it was forbidden -- I mean, you were 13 years old, you -- in spite of it everything -- you tried, you think you're very brave. </sentence><sentence id="364">And so we were speaking in English and, and she told then the story that she was taken and that she trying to be an opera singer. </sentence><sentence id="365">And she -- whenever there was a chance, Nini would sing for the prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="366">And of course we had so few mental escapes, you know. </sentence><sentence id="367">We had so few anything that was nice that was happening, that you were really, we begged her all the time whenever she was being halfway in the mood to sing for us. </sentence><sentence id="368">Well, her sister died in the summer and after that all the spirit went out of her. </sentence><sentence id="369">She just lost all hope and of course she  didn't sing anymore. </sentence><sentence id="370">But shortly before that somehow this SS man, Taube" -- did you ever hear his name, Drechsler(r) and Taube? </sentence><sentence id="371">The woman's name was Drechsler and his name was Taube. </sentence><sentence id="372">They were not officers. </sentence><sentence id="373">They were -- but they were the ones who kept order by beating in the <span class="populated place">camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="374">Well, he had heard that Nini had a wonderful voice, and he proposed that she live in his <span class="building">house</span>, yes, and sing for him. </sentence><sentence id="375">And Nini knew what it meant. </sentence><sentence id="376">But you have to realize for the time that she would have been alive and of course you were hoping everyday that maybe through some miracle there would be some kind of release. </sentence><sentence id="377">But for the time that she might have stalled and would have been alive, she might have lived in clean sheets and would have had a <span class="interior space">bath</span> and would have had some fairly decent food. </sentence><sentence id="378">And so the sacrifice that she made was tremendous. </sentence><sentence id="379">She refused him. </sentence><sentence id="380">And among the next Selektions to the <span class="interior space">gas chamber</span>, her number was prominently mentioned and there was no way that anyone could have erased the number. </sentence><sentence id="381">I mean he made sure that she was on that next <span class="spatial object">transport</span> to the <span class="interior space">gas chamber</span>. </sentence><sentence id="382">And of course she was killed that way. </sentence><sentence id="383">But I have been telling my sons about this and all their lives they've heard about Nini and how the heroic stand that this girl took and her bravery of course. </sentence><sentence id="384">And when I was in <span class="populated place">Jerusalem</span> in 1980, "81, for the gathering, I was looking for people from <span class="populated place">Salonika</span> because I really had a very great rapport with most of them, I mean with all of them. </sentence><sentence id="385">They were really very nice. </sentence><sentence id="386">They were -- you know, young girls who spoke several languages -- they were very happy as far as it could go. </sentence><sentence id="387">They were, were very talented. </sentence><sentence id="388">They danced and they sang. </sentence><sentence id="389">There was still a woman; her name was Stella, who did a lot of dancing and she entertained us. </sentence><sentence id="390">And I was told that she lived in <span class="populated place">Paris</span> after the war, that she and her daughter had some kind of <span class="building">nightclub</span> act. </sentence><sentence id="391">But I understand something sophisticated and everybody asked, "Well, if you're so interested, how come you didn't find out about her?" </sentence><sentence id="392">And I really never found out what became of Stella, but she did entertain us with some very beautiful dancing. </sentence><sentence id="393">But, so I went around looking for people who came from <span class="populated place">Salonika</span> and I didn't meet anyone that I knew. </sentence><sentence id="394">But on the last night when President -- Prime Minister Begin was speaking at the <span class="dlf">Wall</span> --I heard someone, a man in back of me say that he was from <span class="populated place">Salonika</span>. </sentence><sentence id="395">And of course my ears stood up and I turned around and asked him some -- if he knew any of my friends and I, in passing, mentioned that my friend had been Nini Ben Mayoa(ph). </sentence><sentence id="396">No, it's not good. </sentence><sentence id="397">But anyway, he said there was still a Mr. Ben Mayoa(ph) in <span class="populated place">Salonika</span>. </sentence><sentence id="398">He's the head of the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span> and I should get in touch with him. </sentence><sentence id="399">Well, of course, as soon as I came <span class="building">home</span> I tried to figure out a way of getting in touch with him and the only thing I knew how to go about getting a foreign address was get in touch with the Federation. </sentence><sentence id="400">And within a half hour I had the address of the Jewish community in <span class="populated place">Athens</span> who then forwarded the letter to Mr. Ben Mayoa and Mr. Ben Mayoa is a cousin of Nini's. </sentence><sentence id="401">When they were in <span class="populated place">New York</span> we had a very nice visit. </sentence><sentence id="402">We met at the <span class="building">Jewish Theological Seminary</span> because this is half-way between where he was staying and my -- where my <span class="building">house</span> was and a lot of reminiscences and of course we sort of corresponded for a while. </sentence><sentence id="403">It was very interesting to be able to reminisce  about all the thing with Nini. </sentence><sentence id="404">One of the things that Nini sang and I guess it must have been part of her training was <span class="building">Ave Maria</span>. </sentence><sentence id="405">And of course I was -- we always begged her to sing Ave Maria and to this day I am sometimes invited to Catholic weddings and I listen to <span class="spatial object">Ave Maria</span> and of course I start crying. </sentence><sentence id="406">And everybody goes on look at this Jewish woman -- how touched by <span class="building">Ave Maria</span>, but they do not know the memories I have of <span class="building">Ave Maria</span> and Nini. </sentence><sentence id="407">And that was one of real unforgettable friendships that I did form in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="408">And my mother and I were together for the whole time. </sentence><sentence id="409">At first we worked in a <span class="building">factory</span> where they -- it was called "Weberei,"" "the weaving place." </sentence><sentence id="410"><span class="spatial object">Radar</span> was coming into prominence at that time, the <span class="building">British airforce</span> used it against the Nazi airforce. </sentence><sentence id="411">The Nazis tried to stop -- they tried to interfere and cause static so they made us weave. </sentence><sentence id="412">We were told that what it was -- I am not a hundred percent sure. </sentence><sentence id="413">They made us weave plastic -- braid plastic strips and they were going to drop this, hoping that that would interfere with the radar transmission. </sentence><sentence id="414">They were dropping this from <span class="spatial object">planes</span> and we were forced to keep plaiting these things in the <span class="building">Weberei</span>. </sentence><sentence id="415">This was one of the jobs in the <span class="building">Weberei</span> and we worked there for a while. </sentence><sentence id="416">And somehow, through knowing someone, my mother and I were assigned to work in <span class="populated place">Kanada</span>," where all the belongings that came into the <span class="populated place">camp</span> that the prisoners took with them and -- of course, everything was taken away from them. </sentence><sentence id="417">All this was brought in and assorted and than packed and sent into <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="418">And even the word Kanada -- spelled with "K" the German way, "KANADA" -- it was a metaphor for all that is plentiful and available and just there because <span class="country">Canada</span>, I guess to them, meant a lot of riches. </sentence><sentence id="419">And so that's what it was nicknamed. </sentence><sentence id="420">My mother and I worked there, and we assorted mainly blankets and comforters that people had taken with them, hoping that they would be able to use them. </sentence><sentence id="421">Of course most of them didn't even live to see what was happening with it, but even in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> they all had these raggedy old rags and for blankets. </sentence><sentence id="422">They were full of lice and every so often they were cleaned and the <span class="spatial object">straw mattresses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="423">But when the things that were in <span class="populated place">Kanada</span> were assorted and just sent to <span class="country">Germany</span>, and one time was a tremendously high pile of <span class="spatial object">comforters</span>, and we had a few minutes during lunch break, and I had found a book Nathan the wise. </sentence><sentence id="424">Actually the play of Nathan the Wise. </sentence><sentence id="425">During lunchtime, I crawled up on top of the <span class="spatial object">mattress</span> hoping that no one would see me, and I was reading it. </sentence><sentence id="426">But of course when you come in came in from an angle at the, at the <span class="building">barracks</span>, you could see me up on top there. </sentence><sentence id="427">And an SS woman came in and called me down and took the book and threw it away and really boxed my ears until I was dizzy for reading that. </sentence><sentence id="428">So even this small attempt at culture of course was stopped of course. </sentence><sentence id="429">I don't know if you realize that Nathan the Wise was written by a German"! </sentence><sentence id="430">in praise of a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="431">But of course I don't know this, and probably she wasn't even aware of it. </sentence><sentence id="432">It's just that she didn't want anything like this to be available as activity. </sentence><sentence id="433"> 0 While I'm -- the <span class="dlf">belt</span>? </sentence><sentence id="434">Right, the <span class="dlf">belt</span>. </sentence><sentence id="435">While I -- while we were in -- working in <span class="populated place">Kanada</span> we were not allowed to wear what was really -- would be considered civilian clothes. </sentence><sentence id="436">While, the people in <span class="populated place">camp</span>, in the <span class="populated place">camps</span>, were not given these stripped clothes, not all of them, they were wearing stripped clothes. </sentence><sentence id="437">They were given the old rag clothes that were taken off the bodies, and given to them and they lasted until they really fell off and they were full of mud and filth and lice. </sentence><sentence id="438">And then every so often they, they would -- the lice -- the clothes were taken away and they were put in the <span class="interior space">gas chamber</span> to kill the lice, and then of course all the nits were dead but they were all sitting in the seams and were still there. </sentence><sentence id="439">And those were the clothes that the prisoners wore but because we were in <span class="populated place">Kanada</span>, and we were not supposed to wear <span class="building">home</span> anything that was still wearable that they could ship to the <span class="country">Reich</span> they -- we were supposed to wear these long <span class="building">prison</span> uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="440">And I was very -- I was getting thin. </sentence><sentence id="441">I had been sick and the dresses were very long. </sentence><sentence id="442">The mud in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> was just -- it was clay and it stuck to the dresses, to the hem of the <span class="spatial object">dresses</span>, and when it dried it was very heavy and very difficult to remove. </sentence><sentence id="443">And it dragged us down. </sentence><sentence id="444">Of course, we didn't have much strength to drag ourselves around let alone a muddy dress, so most prisoners found some pieces of string, tied it together and pulled up their dresses and we were allowed to do this. </sentence><sentence id="445">I found a <span class="dlf">belt</span>. </sentence><sentence id="446">The Greek girls who came to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> had brought in a lot of knitted dresses with beautiful rose designs knitted into the hem and into the top and when I saw the belt it had, it was blue felt. </sentence><sentence id="447">It had yellow and red felt flowers sewn on. </sentence><sentence id="448">I thought that it was a Greek handiwork, and of course being Greek you know, having been so fond of the Greek girls, I was felt very sentimental about the <span class="spatial object">belt</span>. </sentence><sentence id="449">But later on when I showed it to someone, it turned out that the <span class="dlf">belt</span> was not Greek. </sentence><sentence id="450">But whatever it was, I had the <span class="dlf">belt</span>. </sentence><sentence id="451">And I used it to pull my dress up. </sentence><sentence id="452">Of course we weren't allowed to wear anything that would be an adornment, so because I bloused the belt over the -- bloused my dress over the belt, I was able to wear the belt and no one saw it. </sentence><sentence id="453">And my mother kept saying, "Oh Ruth, you know, look at how thin you're getting, my poor child. </sentence><sentence id="454">Look, this starvation is terrible for you." </sentence><sentence id="455">And so I kept telling her, "But no, the <span class="dlf">belt</span> isn't getting, isn't -- I'm not getting thinner. </sentence><sentence id="456">The <span class="dlf">belt</span> is getting longer. </sentence><sentence id="457">The <span class="dlf">belt</span> is stretching." </sentence><sentence id="458">That's how I tried to appease her. </sentence><sentence id="459">And there was a button at one time on that belt and the button came off and then I ended up just using a safety pin that I found, a tusty old safety pin. </sentence><sentence id="460">And the belt went with me even later on when we worked in -- were in a <span class="populated place">labor camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="461">We were taken to a <span class="populated place">forced labor camp</span>, and I did have another different kind of skirt and I was able to use the belt just as an adornment, but no one paid any attention. </sentence><sentence id="462">This was towards the end of the war, and no one paid any attention to that anymore. </sentence><sentence id="463">And so I had the belt with me all the time. </sentence><sentence id="464">And of course once I was in freedom, I wouldn't part with it. </sentence><sentence id="465">And I was very happy that the <span class="building">Holocaust Museum</span> could make use of it now because I felt that if anyone would go through my belongings and see this raggedy, dirty old faded belt they would say, "What is this woman saving this for?" </sentence><sentence id="466">And this way there is a whole story attached to it and I'm very happy that I can relate this story of the <span class="dlf">belt</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="634">Q: You were telling me earlier about your mother helping a woman who was in trouble. </sentence><sentence id="635">Can  1 you tell us that story? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="638">A: Yes, my, my mother -- when we were in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="639">For a short time there was a -- two sisters were brought in and I think they were from the area of <span class="populated place">Katowice</span> and their names were Tesha and Nusha Unger(ph). </sentence><sentence id="640">That was their maiden name. </sentence><sentence id="641">One of the ladies, as I understand the story -- but I'm not sure about, of course, a hundred percent sure. </sentence><sentence id="642">Nothing is a hundred percent sure of what happened. </sentence><sentence id="643">One of the ladies supposedly had given poison to her children. </sentence><sentence id="644">There was not enough for her. </sentence><sentence id="645">And I'm not sure now, if this is the story that I really -- it was told to me in this kind of secret, or if this was really true. </sentence><sentence id="646">She wanted to commit suicide at the first chance. </sentence><sentence id="647">She was very despondent and one time my mother saw her running out into, into -- towards the <span class="env feature">moat</span> that was out by the <span class="dlf">fence</span>. </sentence><sentence id="648">And of course there were the soldiers on top shooting, and as soon as you crossed this little <span class="dlf">ditch</span> you would be shot but they -- when they saw some one running towards the place, they started shooting immediately too. </sentence><sentence id="649">So my mother ran after her and I mean among all the bullets and amidst all the bullets she was able to pull the woman back. </sentence><sentence id="650">She came to visit us after the war. </sentence><sentence id="651">She and her sister came to visit us after the war. </sentence><sentence id="652">Somehow I've lost touch with them. </sentence><sentence id="653">I'm not sure if the story was that I was told was in the sequence and I hope it doesn't bring out a whole lot of pain to her. </sentence><sentence id="654">We never mentioned it to her. </sentence><sentence id="655">But this is what I think my moth-- this is what my mother told me had happened. </sentence><sentence id="656">And my mother had saved her life. </sentence><sentence id="657">And of course there were many things that we witnessed that I'm not sure if anyone else has talked about it. </sentence><sentence id="658">At one time there was a young man working in a <span class="populated place">camp</span>, supervised by a group of Nazi officers. </sentence><sentence id="659">And inadvertently -- they were shoveling the <span class="env feature">mud</span> there -- he started whistling the Internationale,|" which is the Communist -- yes, the Communist song and the anthem. </sentence><sentence id="660">And as of course, the Nazis were very much opposed to Communism -- that's how they came to power -- this was of course the ultimate in anything they would hate. </sentence><sentence id="661">And immediately on the spot he shot this young man. </sentence><sentence id="662">My mother was telling me this. </sentence><sentence id="663">She was really upset her and aggravated over this when she told me, was very agitated, that she had seen this happen. </sentence><sentence id="664">So those were the things that I remember from <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="665">Of course there are many, many more tales and one time I was working somewhere and my brother was still with us at the time, and my mother and my brother were being taken to a Selektion, and my brother was a child. </sentence><sentence id="666">Of course he was four years younger than me, about nine years old. </sentence><sentence id="667">He was taken -- the Nazi officer told them to go to, to the side. </sentence><sentence id="668">That meant where they were being -- that this group is being sent to the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>, to the -- I'm sorry -- to the <span class="interior space">gas chambers</span>. </sentence><sentence id="669">And my mother and my brother suddenly were taken by a German soldier, pulled away and hidden behind a pile of coal in a different <span class="building">barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="670">And when my mother asked him why he had done this, he said while he was in <span class="country">Poland</span>, there he had witnessed a shooting of -- actually mass shooting of people from a certain <span class="populated place">city</span> -- <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="671">They were taken to a, they were taken to a <span class="interior space">pit</span> and everyone was shot and then thrown into the <span class="interior space">pit</span>. </sentence><sentence id="672">And sometimes they weren't even shot, they were still alive when they were shot into  2 the <span class="dlf">pit</span>. </sentence><sentence id="673">And one of the Nazi officers had said to this woman who was walking up towards the <span class="dlf">pit</span> with two children, one in each hand, that she can live if she picks one of the children to be sent into the -- to be shot and fall into the <span class="dlf">pit</span>. </sentence><sentence id="674">And then she and the other child could live. </sentence><sentence id="675">And the woman of course saw no hope so she firmly grabbed both children and jumped into the <span class="dlf">pit</span>. </sentence><sentence id="676">And this German soldier was so touched by what she had done that he swore to himself at the time that if he ever could save a mother and a child, he would make it his mission to do so. </sentence><sentence id="677">And he did that by saving my mother and my brother and hiding them for the day behind a pile of coal. </sentence><sentence id="678">I never knew who the man was, and my mother didn't know him either. </sentence><sentence id="679">It was just a very strange and human gesture in a <span class="env feature">sea</span>, or in a surrounding, of inhumanity. </sentence><sentence id="680">And it was a very touching thing that something like that could happen, even the-there. </sentence><sentence id="681">And of course it was very, very unusual. </sentence><sentence id="682">When we first came to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, my mother needed -- had some medication at <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="683">And there was a German doctor, Doctor Wolpe(ph) and an SS man standing there, and I went up to him and very naively telling him that my mother needed this medication. </sentence><sentence id="684">And he just laughed at me and walked away and it was -- he was -- there was this irony in his laughter. </sentence><sentence id="685">Of course why was I bothering him with nonsense medication for my mother when she wouldn't be alive probably within a few weeks. </sentence><sentence id="686">So there was very little that was human -- humane in the in anything that happened to us. </sentence><sentence id="687">Of course I still picture the Dr. Mengele"* -- the so- called Dr. Mengele -- who stood at the Selektion and humming Mozart. </sentence><sentence

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="800">A: Oh yes, oh sure. </sentence><sentence id="801">The salami they gave us something like this -- probably about an inch or a little bit less than an inch slice, slab of salami or liverwurst once, or twice, or three times a week in addition to the little pieces of bread that we got daily and the tea that came out, out of the rusty <span class="spatial object">barrels</span> and this "wonderful" turnip soup. </sentence><sentence id="802">And we, one time -- the <span class="spatial object">salami</span> had a terrible odor. </sentence><sentence id="803">They said it was made of horsemeat. </sentence><sentence id="804">It had some kind of a flavor of urine. </sentence><sentence id="805">And one time in the evening I was just given a piece of this salami and I looked out at the <span class="dlf">window</span> and I saw the <span class="building">crematorium</span> going at full force and, or course, was at night, you could see the fire. </sentence><sentence id="806">During the daytime you could only see the smoke coming out but at night you could see the flames. </sentence><sentence id="807">Well, you know, some flames, but the <span class="env feature">sky</span> was fairly red. </sentence><sentence id="808">And I was thinking of the people that were destroyed there and I was thinking, "Oh my God, I hope the salami doesn't contain human flesh." </sentence><sentence id="809">And I threw up from it and after that -- this was towards the end that I was in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> -- and after that I was never able to even catch a piece of the salami and whenever it was given to me, I traded it. </sentence><sentence id="810">Now some people would -- who didn't have the same experiences, I did of course -- didn't know and were anxious to trade it for this little piece of bread that I could get. </sentence><sentence id="811">But I could never eat a piece of salami like that again and that was one of the more -- well I think there were a lot of things that went on and if 1 go through it in my mind, more and more will come out. </sentence><sentence id="812">Of course because I did have typhus, I did forget a lot of the incidents. </sentence><sentence id="813">And maybe in my own mind I try to push them aside. </sentence><sentence id="814">I was never able to watch many of the programs. </sentence><sentence id="815">Even when the Eichmann" trial -- other people were able to watch on <span class="spatial object">television</span> and I just couldn't face up to it. </sentence><sentence id="816">I it's only recently I have written on the Holocaust and have spoken about it at <span class="building">colleges</span> on it, that Iam able to do this. </sentence><sentence id="817">I still cannot get any kind, watch any kind of movie on the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="818">I sometimes think, "Oh I'm brave. </sentence><sentence id="819">I'm going to do this now." </sentence><sentence id="820">And two minutes into the program, and it goes off. </sentence><sentence id="821">And I don't even go to any war pictures of any kind of war. </sentence><sentence id="822">I think maybe one of the reasons I am so anxious to talk about it is that I think that this kind of cruelty can be prevented and can be stopped before it gets out of hand ever. </sentence><sentence id="823">Maybe that's my small contribution I can make to this. </sentence><sentence id="824"> 4 </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="934">Q: Let's go back to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> for a moment. </sentence><sentence id="935">You were telling me the story what happened at Christmastime. </sentence><sentence id="936">Would you tell the story? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="940">A: Yes, this is Christmas Day, 1943. </sentence><sentence id="941">In <span class="country">Germany</span> -- <span class="country">Germany</span> celebrates two days of Christmas This is the last day of Christmas and so it had to be December 25th in 1943. </sentence><sentence id="942">It's very much in my memory, one of the few things that I really remember very, very clearly. </sentence><sentence id="943">In the summer before, a woman had, a Jewish woman had been brought into <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="944">She had been a young married woman, and what wasn't obvious at the time was that she was pregnant. </sentence><sentence id="945">And when she -- as she went along of course, she was losing weight because she was getting emaciated. </sentence><sentence id="946">And these <span class="building">prison</span> clothes, these ill-fitting clothes whatever it was, was hiding her condition. </sentence><sentence id="947">And when we went out to roll call, we were five deep. </sentence><sentence id="948">So the prisoners sort of always put her in between where it couldn't be noticed. </sentence><sentence id="949">I mean, it was like an unwritten order that we had among ourselves that we just obeyed. </sentence><sentence id="950">At the same time there were also non- Jewish laborers, and some of them were in our <span class="building">barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="951">There was one particular woman I remember, Pani Wandzia(ph), a very tall aristocratic woman. </sentence><sentence id="952">And we -- I was told that she came from some very aristocratic family. </sentence><sentence id="953">She was allowed -- the Polish prisoners somehow I think were allowed to have two times a year packages mailed from <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="954">She had one at Christmas time. </sentence><sentence id="955">And then there were these three Polish slave labor women who worked outside the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, but stayed in the <span class="building">barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="956">And I don't think they got any Christmas -- there was no one to send them any packages too. </sentence><sentence id="957">And so they worked outside the <span class="populated place">camp</span> somewhere and they were treated almost as badly as Jewish prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="958">The only exception was -- got the same food, got the same everything, except non-Jewish prisoners were never taken to <span class="populated place">Selektion</span>. </sentence><sentence id="959">If they died, they died, but nothing was done really to help them, nothing was done by the German authorities. </sentence><sentence id="960">But that was the only difference. </sentence><sentence id="961">Of course it made a large difference but they were treated the same. </sentence><sentence id="962">And so they worked somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="963">Now came Christmas time. </sentence><sentence id="964">Somehow they managed to pluck from somewhere this tiny little branch of a <span class="env feature">pine tree</span>, probably about this tall, and they made a <span class="dlf">base</span> out of chewed bread and stuck this <span class="env feature">Christmas tree</span> in. </sentence><sentence id="965">And it so happened that this woman who was pregnant, went into labor that night, and had a little boy. </sentence><sentence id="966">Now the next morning there was no roll call and that that was the only free time that I remember while I was in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, when there was no Zahlappell in the morning or in the evening, one, one day. </sentence><sentence id="967">And I think it was only because the SS were out late reveling at night and they didn't expect to get up very early, so they figured well they weren't going to do it that one day. </sentence><sentence id="968">And the next morning my mother and I walked outside and the <span class="populated place">camp</span> was in some strange quiet. </sentence><sentence id="969">There was an awe about it. </sentence><sentence id="970">It seemed almost like pink cotton was enveloping the whole <span class="populated place">camp</span> -- strange light. </sentence><sentence id="971">And between a little Jewish boy being born the night before, and being Christmas time and this strange light in the -- around us, these Polish women kept saying that a miracle has happened. </sentence><sentence id="972">And this must be the miracle when we would be freed. </sentence><sentence id="973">And this would be the day. </sentence><sentence id="974">And when you're so desperate  7 -- even though I am Jewish and didn't think that could happen to me, I wasn't brought up to believe in it-- we somehow decided to believe, "Well, maybe you hang on to this. </sentence><sentence id="975">Maybe there is some truth to the story." </sentence><sentence id="976">And this went on almost all day. </sentence><sentence id="977">Now -- and everyone was beginning to be a little bit, to talk, to begin to talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="978">| mean we really didn't believe it. </sentence><sentence id="979">We were too realistic and too many things had happened. </sentence><sentence id="980">Somehow we felt that maybe something could happen. </sentence><sentence id="981">Well, by five o'clock of course the spell was broken. </sentence><sentence id="982">Was around five o'clock, towards evening, when this spell was broken. </sentence><sentence id="983">We heard the familiar sound of four, three or four <span class="spatial object">army trucks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="984">People were on the <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> -- open <span class="spatial object">trucks</span>, with prisoners being taken to the <span class="interior space">gas chamber</span>. </sentence><sentence id="985">And it was preceded by an German, the <span class="spatial object">command car</span> that the couple of German officers rode in, and in back of it was the <span class="spatial object">car</span> with the <span class="spatial object">Red Cross</span> on it that, whoever would observe it would think there's some kind of <span class="building">Red Cross</span>, some kind of charitable or humane--humanitarian project going on. </sentence><sentence id="986">But of course that was the <span class="spatial object">truck</span> that held the gas. </sentence><sentence id="987">And they, we of course recognized the noise of the approaching <span class="spatial object">trucks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="988">At that point when the they drove between the <span class="populated place">men's camp</span> and the <span class="populated place">women's camp</span> which was separated by high <span class="dlf">wires</span>, electrically-charged wires, and they had to go around the <span class="dlf">bend</span> and get to the <span class="building">crematorium</span>, to the <span class="dlf">chimneys</span> which we saw, and we didn't see the actual compound from the <span class="populated place">camp</span> but we saw the <span class="dlf">chimneys</span>. </sentence><sentence id="989">Of course they were very tall. </sentence><sentence id="990">So they approached the <span class="building">crematorium</span> and as they -- the prisoners in the first <span class="spatial object">truck</span> came within the sight of the <span class="dlf">chimneys</span> -- they started singing the Hatikvah. </sentence><sentence id="991">"deg And then the second <span class="spatial object">truck</span> started in and then the third and fourth -- if there was four. </sentence><sentence id="992">I am not a hundred percent sure how many. </sentence><sentence id="993">And of course they were driven into the compound of the <span class="building">crematorium</span> and as they were driven in, the first voice stopped. </sentence><sentence id="994">The first <span class="spatial object">truck</span> stopped and then the second and then the third, and we had the, the familiar noises of the steam going and the smell and the noises of the gra--grates of the of the <span class="spatial object">ovens</span>, and the next morning, this roll call again. </sentence><sentence id="995">And of course no miracle had happened. </sentence><sentence id="996">But as we were standing roll call, there was -- the body of the baby washed out into the into the <span class="dlf">ditches</span> that I don't know where it went because actually the Germans probably would have seen that there was a baby, would have seen the body. </sentence><sentence id="997">I don't know where it ended, but maybe they didn't even pay attention or maybe it went somewhere <span class="interior space">underground</span>, and that was the end of the miracle. </sentence><sentence id="998">And it took another two years or so before we were really liberated, and a year and a half before we were liberated. </sentence><sentence id="999">As a matter of fact bodies of babies -- speaking of that, when we were in working in <span class="populated place">Kanada</span>, there was a baby found, smothered in the blankets. </sentence><sentence id="1000">It seems that either in the rush the baby was taken away from the mother and pushed in with the blankets, or maybe the mother tried to save the baby by putting it in with the belongings that she had, hoping that someone would pick up the baby, somewhat like Moses or so. </sentence><sentence id="1001">But of course nothing happened. </sentence><sentence id="1002">And the baby was found dead rolled in some of these blankets and things. </sentence><sentence id="1003">So lives of children were very cheap and very expendable. </sentence><sentence id="1004">It was, it's a terrible thing. </sentence><sentence id="1005">I think over 1,000.000 or so of the 6,000,000 that died were children. </sentence><sentence id="1006">You don't know all the potential that was killed at the time with such.... And that  8 was one of the things -- another one of the things that went on in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1007">And you know, when you speak about <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, everyone has the same story of lice and rats and filthy clothes and beatings. </sentence><sentence id="1008">My mother -- there was a time when a woman, Mala,"" the --you might have heard this famous -- she was a page or like an errand run--runner, between the Germans -- between the Nazis and different groups of Nazis, and sometimes to the prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="1009">She had some friends and they managed to get Nazi clothes and they escaped from the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1010">And a few days later she was caught and brought back to <span class="populated place">camp</span>, and she was hung. </sentence><sentence id="1011">They had a <span class="dlf">moat</span> like, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1012">A few days after afterwards, they had to drag her and one of the things that everyone was saying was so amazing. </sentence><sentence id="1013">According to the Geneva Conference, you are supposed to -- that was the story I was told -- according to the Geneva Agreement, you're supposed to cure prisoners -- a prisoner before you execute him. </sentence><sentence id="1014">And this is -- and we were amazed that, of course, what did they pay attention to about Geneva conventions? </sentence><sentence id="1015">They dragged this poor woman with broken legs to the to the <span class="spatial object">gallows</span> and hanged her there. </sentence><sentence id="1016">And around the same time they had, they wanted to check up and make sure that we had all the -- that anyone was there, that no one escaped. </sentence><sentence id="1017">So they had extra roll call, this extra Zahlappell every hour, every hour of the day. </sentence><sentence id="1018">And of course when you were standing at <span class="populated place">Zahlappell</span> -- it had to be like this -- and you weren't allowed to move at all. </sentence><sentence id="1019">This SS woman Drechsler came to take the <span class="spatial object">Zahlappell</span>, and my mother stood perfectly still but she followed her with her eyes. </sentence><sentence id="1020">She saw the eyes moving, so she pulled my mother out of the ranks and slapped her and my mother fell to the <span class="interior space">floor</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1021">Luckily she didn't shoot her right then and there. </sentence><sentence id="1022">But my mother had an ear ailment, she damaged her ear. </sentence><sentence id="1023">Until my mother died four years ago, this never cleared up completely and it was from that time. </sentence><sentence id="1024">But <span class="populated place">Mala</span>'s story has been written up. </sentence><sentence id="1025">I know that. </sentence><sentence id="1026">It is written in -- I just recently read it again in a book Anus Mundi, by a Polish man."* </sentence><sentence id="1027">He wrote about this extensively. </sentence><sentence id="1028">And this was one of the other things that went on in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1029">Every day was the same and for everyone, but not -- and yet everyone has an individual story of his individual tragedy, their individual story of hopeless and whatever happened to them, so yes, it was all the same. </sentence><sentence id="1030">We were all the same. </sentence><sentence id="1031">We didn't even have a name. </sentence><sentence id="1032">We had a number. </sentence><sentence id="1033">We had our hair shaved, which was lucky because lice were by the billions. </sentence><sentence id="1034">But we also had individual things that we can remember and talk about. </sentence></p></dialogue>

Well, we were taken from <span class="populated place">Malchow</span> -- from  9 <span class="populated place">Ravensbriick</span> to <span class="populated place">Malchow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1136"><span class="populated place">Malchow</span> was -- had been, originally, a <span class="populated place">labor camp</span> equipped to have about 1,000 people. </sentence><sentence id="1137">But by the time we came in there were several thousand in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1138">But it was amazing to us. </sentence><sentence id="1139">There were actual <span class="spatial object">table</span> and <span class="spatial object">chairs</span>, <span class="spatial object">benches</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1140">There was a real <span class="spatial object">water fountain</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1141">And there were <span class="spatial object">bunk beds</span>, which was two to a <span class="spatial object">bed</span> instead of six, with actual blankets. </sentence><sentence id="1142">And there were <span class="interior space">cupboards</span> to put your clothes in, little somethings. </sentence><sentence id="1143">And of course we didn't have anything to put in, but we -- they were there and they were signs of civilization, something that.... It's amazing that how much, we had lived among civilized things with the equipment of civilization. </sentence><sentence id="1144">I was -- nice <span class="spatial object">furniture</span> and everything, and yet when we saw these crude <span class="interior space">closets</span> we were amazed that this was civilization. </sentence><sentence id="1145">And that there was something other than <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> out there. </sentence><sentence id="1146">And so we lived with in the in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> with this and we were taken to a <span class="populated place">labor camp</span>, to a labor to a <span class="building">factory</span> to work. </sentence><sentence id="1147">This was a <span class="populated place">labor camp</span>, this became a -- but it became a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> really because the SS officers went. </sentence><sentence id="1148">Some of them came from <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> with us and some were picked up in different places and they were there. </sentence><sentence id="1149">We were taken in the morning and marched for about several miles to something that looked like <span class="env feature">woods</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1150">They were <span class="env feature">woods</span>, and where the <span class="env feature">trees</span> were sparse they planted artificial trees, and there were nets with leaves overhead to camouflage the, the things that were going on there. </sentence><sentence id="1151">Then there was a <span class="env feature">sand hill</span> with some <span class="env feature">trees</span> coming out of it, and on the side was a <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1152">Once you walked into this <span class="dlf">door</span> it was like a very modern looking <span class="building">laboratory</span> or some very clean <span class="building">factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1153">It was actually an <span class="building">ammunition factory</span>, very well camouflaged from attack from over-fly -- overhead <span class="spatial object">planes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1154">And we were -- actually the whole <span class="populated place">camp</span> was honey-combed underneath with all these different <span class="building">factories</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1155">One group I know was making hand grenades. </sentence><sentence id="1156">Our group was making bullets. </sentence><sentence id="1157">And for being such a very modern <span class="building">factory</span> and very cleverly designed <span class="building">factory</span>, there was really the equip- the way we made the bullets was very primitive. </sentence><sentence id="1158">There was a <span class="spatial object">board</span> with little <span class="dlf">holes</span> in it that I think there were 24 or whatever the number, tiny little small <span class="dlf">holes</span>, and there was a -- we -- there was a half a capsule of a bullet put in -- that we put it in--into each one of the <span class="dlf">holes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1159">Then we filled a certain amount of gunpowder into it, and then the other half of this <span class="spatial object">board</span> closed over it. </sentence><sentence id="1160">Something like a <span class="spatial object">waffle iron</span>, on that idea, or a <span class="spatial object">hamburger press</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1161">And the other half of the <span class="spatial object">capsule</span> of the bullet was pushed down and that made a bullet that would be used I guess in a regular gun. </sentence><sentence id="1162">At both ends of the <span class="spatial object">table</span> -- these were long <span class="spatial object">tables</span> we were sitting at and must have been about 20 or 30 prisoners on each <span class="spatial object">table</span> -- and on each end was a SS woman making sure that we did the right thing. </sentence><sentence id="1163">Well, it was very difficult but I tried to not line up the top with the bottom part of this <span class="spatial object">board</span> as much as I could without being detected because I really didn't want to be hit or killed or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1164">But I tried to sort of squeeze it in a crooked way so that it would close but not quite. </sentence><sentence id="1165">And I was hoping that these bullets would misfire and I was hoping that in this way it would be my part of the war effort against the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="1166">Well, we worked in this <span class="populated place">camp</span>, and after the first of the year <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> was -- I think in the beginning of January, <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> was emptied and they brought a lot of prisoners from <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> to <span class="populated place">Malchow</span>, I guess, and different places. </sentence><sentence id="1167">Most of the prisoners who came to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, who came from <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> were the Gypsies. </sentence><sentence id="1168">Of course you know, the Gypsies had been in a <span class="populated place">camp</span> in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> and they were killed by  0 families, just the way the Jews were killed. </sentence><sentence id="1169">Because, in this hierarchy of "superman" that the Germans established, the Gypsies were just about one rank higher than the Jews and, of course, they had to be eliminated because they were a "lower people." </sentence><sentence id="1170">And so we saw the Gypsies in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> and they were first brought in the end of -- the middle of 1944, something like that. </sentence><sentence id="1171">They might have been there before but I became aware of them at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1172">And then they were brought to <span class="populated place">Malchow</span> and they were very nice. </sentence><sentence id="1173">They were happy- go-lucky people. </sentence><sentence id="1174">They sang. </sentence><sentence id="1175">And maybe because they knew that the end of the Nazi era was coming -- we weren't aware of it as much but they had been walking from <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> to <span class="populated place">Malchow</span> which is I don't know how many miles, hundreds of miles -- and they had seen what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="1176">They had taken meat of the dead horses and they brought it to <span class="populated place">camp</span> and they barbecued it and they shared it with who ever came along. </sentence><sentence id="1177">It was exceedingly nice. </sentence><sentence id="1178">And I mean they -- I really have very, very good memories of the Gypsy people. </sentence><sentence id="1179">The only thing that they did is that they were looking for wood to barbecue the meat. </sentence><sentence id="1180">They took apart the <span class="spatial object">toilets</span>, the <span class="dlf">doors</span>, and there was no place where to go any more, so we had to squat just over a <span class="dlf">hole</span> rather than over this little bit of wooden frame that was made for <span class="spatial object">toilet</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1181">But the Gypsies were very nice when they were brought in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1182">And you know, I do speak about I do speak on the Holocaust very often, <span class="building">schools</span>, <span class="building">churches</span>, <span class="building">colleges</span>, and I do want to mention the Gypsies because until recently no one set up a memorial. </sentence><sentence id="1183">No one did anything for them and the poor Gypsies are -- I mean so many died unnamed that something -- someone should remember that there were these people at one time and they were a kind and gentle people. </sentence><sentence id="1184">Throughout the history of <span class="country">Europe</span> they were really denounced and, and feared and everything and they were very, very nice and gentle and very helpful. </sentence><sentence id="1185">But the -- and they were in a <span class="populated place">camp</span> with us. </sentence><sentence id="1186">We were in a <span class="populated place">camp</span> then when more and more people came in and eventually they could not take us to the <span class="building">factories</span> anymore, and we stayed in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1187">The <span class="dlf">roads</span> became clogged with eastern Europeans trying to get back to their <span class="building">homes</span>, and Russian -- I'm sorry --- German soldiers trying to run away from the Russian armies going, west and refugees --- German refugees who lived in <span class="country">Poland</span> and were afraid of what would then happen to them were trying to make it to <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1188">And most of the <span class="dlf">roads</span> were clogged with this and you couldn't get -- you couldn't go to <span class="building">work</span> anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1189">And of course everything was breaking down and we -- nothing was happening any more. </sentence><sentence id="1190">So -- but what happened when in the last few days before the war ended was they also didn't give us any food any more and there were food riots because we were actually starving. </sentence><sentence id="1191">The <span class="building">warehouses</span> were full of -- well, they were not full, but there was bread in the <span class="building">warehouses</span> and the prisoners were -- didn't get anything so we rioted to get in. </sentence><sentence id="1192">And my one -- think a day or two, we were liberated -- we were made to walk out of the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, march out of the <span class="populated place">camp</span> on May 1, 1945. </sentence><sentence id="1193">A day or two before there were these food riots and some--sometimes the Nazis from outside the <span class="populated place">camp</span> -- this German officer would see the riots so they would shoot at the prisoners, sometimes. </sentence><sentence id="1194">And once in a while someone was hurt from the shootings. </sentence><sentence id="1195">Sometimes they shot in the <span class="env feature">air</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1196">But they couldn't stop us. </sentence><sentence id="1197">I mean we knew that things were already happening and we really lost more and more of our fear you know, to some degree anyway. </sentence><sentence id="1198">And so we went -- we were rioting  1 and my mother was in the <span class="building">barracks</span> and I was out and she was told that someone had been shot and of course she immediately imagined that it was me, but it wasn't. </sentence><sentence id="1199">We stormed the <span class="building">food barracks</span> and that afternoon -- that must have been the day before we were leaving -- the food that the Nazis were eating -- these Nazi officers in their <span class="interior space">mess hall</span> -- was left on the <span class="spatial object">table</span>, untouched like some of the fairy tales. </sentence><sentence id="1200">You know, the stuff is sitting there and the people are gone. </sentence><sentence id="1201">And we were starved, but we ignored it and we were looking for the <span class="interior space">chamber</span> where they would keep all the food. </sentence><sentence id="1202">So, we came to the <span class="interior space">storage place</span>, and there was something that looked like noodles to me. </sentence><sentence id="1203">Now, you have to realize I haven't had -- I didn't have anything decent to eat you know in these years and noodles, my God. </sentence><sentence id="1204">I took the noodles hoping that we would be able to at some point cook them and eat them, but I didn't know how, what to do, how to carry these. </sentence><sentence id="1205">Well, we already had been given regulation underwear, gray flannel. </sentence><sentence id="1206">It was tied with a string and that was it, but among the things that I wasn't supposed to wear was somewhere that I had found a pair of pink silk underwear. </sentence><sentence id="1207">So I had that underneath the gray flannel. </sentence><sentence id="1208">So I took off the gray flannels, pulled out the string, tied it on the bottom and made a bag and put these noodles in. </sentence><sentence id="1209">We then were told to line up to leave the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1210">At that point the <span class="building">Swedish Red Cross</span> had sent packages for the prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="1211">And the first few prisoners, each one got a package, and then it was two to a package and because they were running out of packages. </sentence><sentence id="1212">Then it was five to a <span class="spatial object">package</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1213">And then by the time it came to us it was five to a package, which was a lucky thing because these packages contained cocoa and sardines and butter and our stomachs were not used to this. </sentence><sentence id="1214">My mother became deadly ill from just eating something oily. </sentence><sentence id="1215">I think sardines. </sentence><sentence id="1216">You know, we fell over it and actually she ended up in a <span class="building">hospital</span> -- in a <span class="building">British army hospital</span>, for a few days because she was so sick. </sentence><sentence id="1217">The right thing to -- would have been probably to have some cereal a few times a day cooked in water and gradually bring our stomachs back to normal. </sentence><sentence id="1218">But that of course didn't happen. </sentence><sentence id="1219">So we were given these packages and gradually everyone along the way had diarrhea and we were marched out of the <span class="populated place">camp</span> and the SS went with us. </sentence><sentence id="1220">A few disappeared as we were marched along. </sentence><sentence id="1221">At one time we were taken over a make-shift <span class="dlf">bridge</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1222">The <span class="dlf">bridge</span> had been destroyed but we had to get over a small part of the <span class="env feature">river</span>, and they took, there was a <span class="building">tavern</span> on the <span class="dlf">hill</span> below -- above the <span class="dlf">bridge</span>, and the <span class="dlf">bridge</span> was below and the <span class="env feature">river</span> was all the way down. </sentence><sentence id="1223">So they took <span class="spatial object">tables</span> and tied the legs together and made a <span class="dlf">bridge</span>, and we could only go over like two or three people at a time. </sentence><sentence id="1224">Was a beautiful sunset I remember and we were walking over this. </sentence><sentence id="1225">And then we got to another part and I'm carrying this bag of noodles, what I thought was noodles, with me right along. </sentence><sentence id="1226">And then on the way wherever we went, we managed to find -- it was I guess harvest time or whatever, we found potatoes in the <span class="env feature">ground</span>, and we managed to make a <span class="spatial object">bonfire</span> and bake the potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="1227">They were most of the time just charred on the top and the inside was raw. </sentence><sentence id="1228">They tasted horrible but we managed to at least eat that. </sentence><sentence id="1229">And I carried this bag with noodles with me, waiting for an opportunity to cook it. </sentence><sentence id="1230">Gradually the SS did disappear and sometimes they put on clothes to make them look like they were part of us. </sentence><sentence id="1231">We knew who they were, and of course they did have a tattoo under their arm to identify them as SS people. </sentence><sentence id="1232">But of course we didn't see that and they thought well maybe no one would know about it  2 and they would get away, you know, by just mixing with the population and pretending that they had -- were nice people. </sentence><sentence id="1233">So at one time we were brought into what had been a <span class="building">sugar factory</span>, was completely empty. </sentence><sentence id="1234">I guess there was no more sugar available. </sentence><sentence id="1235">And an SS woman saw me pass by and she called me into a small <span class="building">office</span> and she was cleaning her guns there. </sentence><sentence id="1236">And she said to me, "I guess you'll be free soon." </sentence><sentence id="1237">And I was afraid to say, "Oh, how wonderful! </sentence><sentence id="1238">Of course. </sentence><sentence id="1239">I'm glad my time is finally coming." </sentence><sentence id="1240">So, I was saying. " </sentence><sentence id="1241">Oh well, maybe it won't be so fast yet." </sentence><sentence id="1242">I was trying to tell her something, and I think it might have saved my life, knowing full well that, of course, liberation was just a few days away. </sentence><sentence id="1243">But I was afraid to antagonize her yet, and that was actually my last encounter with them. </sentence><sentence id="1244">They really sort of disappeared and when they finally -- when we finally did see them again, they were checked for this tattoo under their <span class="interior space">arm pits</span>, by -- I think the British part of the army that we saw. </sentence><sentence id="1245">Well, anyway coming back to my noodles and these horrible potatoes that we were broiling -- baking on the way. </sentence><sentence id="1246">Finally, my mother found a rusty can of some sort and we went up -- we were right along the <span class="env feature">ocean</span>, the <span class="env feature">North Sea</span>, and my mother went and got some water. </sentence><sentence id="1247">And she went to see that we finally would cook these potatoes, these noodles, I'm sorry. </sentence><sentence id="1248">Well the thing grew and grew and grew, and what I had dragged from <span class="populated place">Malchow</span> were dehydrated potatoes when all we had was potatoes and I had dragged this out. </sentence><sentence id="1249">It was one of my real disappointments of -- you know, of having this. </sentence><sentence id="1250">But it was part of the life that went on in that was part of, of <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> --a part of my experiences. </sentence><sentence id="1251">When of course when my mother and I walked on, we were near the <span class="env feature">Elbe</span> and we -- the first thing we know, we saw was this <span class="spatial object">tank</span> with different insignias on it. </sentence><sentence id="1252">It was an <span class="spatial object">American army tank</span> saluting us and we went one way and they went the other way. </sentence><sentence id="1253">And then it -- within a few hours, occupation forces changed, because all the different forces were meeting at in that spot -- so at one time the French and British and Russians. </sentence><sentence id="1254">And we ended up in a British, in a <span class="region">British zone</span> in -- at the time in a <span class="region">zone</span> -- I don't know what it finally became. </sentence><sentence id="1255">And we were there in a like a <span class="populated place">tent city</span> which was during the summer, which was alright. </sentence><sentence id="1256">We were in one section of the <span class="populated place">camp</span> and on the other side there was another <span class="populated place">tent camp</span> where there were Italian soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="1257">It seems that when Mussolini was hanged he was -- the soldiers in the Italian army had a choice of either joining the German army or becoming prisoners of war. </sentence><sentence id="1258">These soldiers that were on the other side of the <span class="populated place">camp</span> had been the prisoners of war, and they were now being repatriated to <span class="country">Italy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1259">The only thing was I mean the <span class="spatial object">transportation</span> was destroyed and communications were hardly working. </sentence><sentence id="1260">So the they were sitting in this <span class="populated place">camp</span> waiting for things to normalize so they were in one <span class="populated place">camp</span> and we were in this <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1261">Then when it was -- when summer was coming to an end, the British army had to see -- you know, they couldn't keep us out in the winter. </sentence><sentence id="1262">And they made some kind of travel arrangements for us in <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> and on <span class="spatial object">cart</span>, <span class="spatial object">rail</span>, whatever was available to get back to <span class="populated place">Frankfurt</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1263">They asked us where we wanted to go. </sentence><sentence id="1264">Now we had agreed with my father and everyone -- you know, my brother and my mother --  3 that whoever would live would try to make his way back to <span class="populated place">Frankfurt</span> and so we could be united as a family and then see where we would go from there. </sentence><sentence id="1265">So we arrived in <span class="populated place">Frankfurt</span>, sometime in the Fall. </sentence><sentence id="1266">We came back, and the <span class="populated place">city</span> was practically destroyed. </sentence><sentence id="1267">Almost everything was gone. </sentence><sentence id="1268">Even my mother who had no great love for anything German that had happened, after what had happened to us, really was like shocked when she saw this, saw this horrible destruction. </sentence><sentence id="1269">And we stayed overnight in this <span class="building">hotel</span> near the near the <span class="building">railroad station</span> where all kinds of people met. </sentence><sentence id="1270">And everybody exchanged experiences and there was no place else to go. </sentence><sentence id="1271">At one point in that evening an American soldier came in and he had looked at the lists that the <span class="building">UNRRA</span>"" and the <span class="building">HIAS</span>"! </sentence><sentence id="1272">had printed of survivors and -- as much information as they could, the origin and birthplace of the people. </sentence><sentence id="1273">So, he had seen that we were from <span class="populated place">Frankfurt</span> and he was looking for a family in <span class="populated place">Frankfurt</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1274">He had left before the war and been in the American Army and was now looking for relatives, hoping that someone could tell them what had happened to him -- to them. </sentence><sentence id="1275">And in the conversation -- we didn't know anything about his relatives -- but in the conversation, he mentioned that while he was doing the same thing in -- while he was in <span class="country">Italy</span> he had read about a young boy who was also from <span class="populated place">Frankfurt</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1276">So he went to ask him about his relatives. </sentence><sentence id="1277">And the young boy fit the description of my brother. </sentence><sentence id="1278">So we said, "How do I write to him? </sentence><sentence id="1279">How do I -- can I get in touch with him?" </sentence><sentence id="1280">So he, he gave us an <span class="building">Army post</span> number, and we wrote to them. </sentence><sentence id="1281">And somehow, the letter did get to my brother and he was in Baury(ph) at the time. </sentence><sentence id="1282">He had been liberated near the <span class="dlf">Austrian border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1283">He had remained in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> until the end. </sentence><sentence id="1284">And in January of 1945, they emptied <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1285">They were burning all the bodies and all the evidence that was around, as much as they could, of course. </sentence><sentence id="1286">By then they were scared stiff for their own lives. </sentence><sentence id="1287">They thought that everything that happened, that they had done to other

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1510">A: This was in <span class="populated place">Frankfurt</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1511">When I sometimes think that the war against the Jews didn't just start in 1933. </sentence><sentence id="1512">It started much earlier -- ended up in 1933. </sentence><sentence id="1513">One of my first memories was probably before the Hitler election in 1932 or so. </sentence><sentence id="1514">We --I lived, we lived in an <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, the <span class="interior space">second floor</span> -- <span class="interior space">third floor</span>, and the, there was a, a propaganda banner for the Socialist -- National Socialist, Nazis -- strung between -- across the <span class="dlf">streets</span> down between the two <span class="building">apartment houses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1515">And there was a lot of agitation in the <span class="env feature">air</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1516">I mean a lot of agra-- they were really trying to get to the Jewish people, and to, to convince the non-Jews that they should vote for the Nazis because Jews were their enemy -- and also against Communists, against anything that they wanted to be against. </sentence><sentence id="1517">And so this <span class="spatial object">banner</span> was across -- was strung across and I looked down. </sentence><sentence id="1518">My parents had gone out, left me in the <span class="building">house</span> and I had -- I saw the <span class="spatial object">banner</span> and I looked down. </sentence><sentence id="1519">And but you know when you're three years old you don't have depth perception, and I don't think -- and to me it seemed like it was a <span class="dlf">barrier</span> and my parents would never come back. </sentence><sentence id="1520">And from that time on I did --I think I've told you this -- and from that time on I knew that, you know, everything was topsy-turvy. </sentence><sentence id="1521">We -- this -- I think I have very many bad memories of people being killed, of relatives being taken away. </sentence><sentence id="1522">My Aunt Selma volunteered. </sentence><sentence id="1523">Her, her fiance was -- my Aunt Selma could have stayed behind. </sentence><sentence id="1524">Her fiance was taken to the -- to be selected to go to <span class="country">Poland</span>, ostensibly, "resettlement in the <span class="region">east</span>" as it was called. </sentence><sentence id="1525">And she just volunteered to go with him, and we never heard of or saw her again. </sentence><sentence id="1526">And that was, that was life in <span class="country">Germany</span> and Europe. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1548">A: Oh, very simple. </sentence><sentence id="1549">I mean there were organizations that helped. </sentence><sentence id="1550">The <span class="building">HIAS</span>, the <span class="building">UNRRA</span> had their own groups. </sentence><sentence id="1551">And we were told that we -- was some form of Jewish organization. </sentence><sentence id="1552">Of course there was a very large <span class="populated place">displaced persons camp</span> in <span class="populated place">Zeilsheim</span> which was out on the outskirts of <span class="populated place">Hechst</span>, which is on the outskirts of <span class="populated place">Frankfurt</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1553">And you -- you know, you listened to everything through the <span class="dlf">grapevine</span> and we were told we should sign up -- go to the <span class="building">American Embassy</span> or <span class="building">Consulate</span> and get our papers. </sentence><sentence id="1554">And we did that. </sentence><sentence id="1555">And then, of course,  5 we waited, because of my -- because we thought of my father and we waited until the last day to get to, to embark. </sentence><sentence id="1556">But that is what we did. </sentence><sentence id="1557">And of course in the <span class="country">United States</span>, we were met by ladies from the <span class="building">HIAS</span> and the <span class="building">UNRRA</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1558">And HIAS were actually in the -- and we were put for a few nights into a <span class="building">hotel</span> on off-Broadway. </sentence><sentence id="1559">I think it was on <span class="dlf">103rd Street</span> and off-Broadway, or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="1560">And then my mother took a job in <span class="populated place">Clifton</span>, <span class="region">New Jersey</span> and we stayed there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1574">Q: How -- you were telling me earlier, the way people reacted to you in the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1575">Can you talk about that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1578">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1579">I am not happy to talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="1580">It seems that we were not treated as having had the experiences that we did. </sentence><sentence id="1581">We were not treated as equal human beings, somehow. </sentence><sentence id="1582">We were told to take work as laborers, as domestics and this sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="1583">And even though now my husband had been an American soldier -- and to him I was someone who had survived a <span class="populated place">camp</span> and had been brave enough and human enough to survive and be treated as a human being -- his mother didn't go along with this. </sentence><sentence id="1584">To her everything that was European -- and she was born in <span class="region">Eastern Europe</span> -- everything that was European was lowly and despised -- despic--despicable, and shouldn't be.... She wanted to stay away from this and she didn't want to have anything to do with it and so this was wasn't good enough for her son. </sentence><sentence id="1585">And I did have a lot of problems with her, and I found, in general, that a lot of people had this sort of reaction. </sentence><sentence id="1586">I was active in the Memorial Committee --the <span class="building">Holocaust Memorial</span> which is usually sometimes in April -- and the people -- the men who had worked on this before I became active in it, told me that they had a lot of resistance to making a memorial service and to even speaking about this. </sentence><sentence id="1587">And they had difficulty getting a stage to do the memorial service and it has only become fashionable to -- I don't know, in the last 20 or so years -- to speak about it, and to not consider it a badge of shame which -- of course, which it wasn't. </sentence><sentence id="1588">But I think we as surviv-- as prisoners of the Nazis were told that we were "Untermenschen,"" sub-sub-humans. </sentence><sentence id="1589">That we were not up to par. </sentence><sentence id="1590">And I think it was so drilled into us that we kept actually believing that it still was true. </sentence><sentence id="1591">And what we really should have had, was a lot of counseling. </sentence><sentence id="1592">But, of course, organizations were more -- they found the immediate need for clothing us, and feeding us, and finding <span class="building">shelter</span> that that was really secondary. </sentence><sentence id="1593">It would have been just as important as any of the other things, because a lot of people floundered, have terrible traumatic lives since then because of that. </sentence><sentence id="1594">And this is one of the -- I think -- things that have been learned that now most people do get counseling after hostage situations or after <span class="building">prison</span> situations. </sentence><sentence id="1595">And immediately they do get counseling and it's very,  6 very important. </sentence><sentence id="1596">It's one of the things that can't be stressed enough. </sentence><sentence id="1597">So life was very, very difficult for people arriving from <span class="building">home</span>, without a family, with their whole background destroyed, without any means of support. </sentence><sentence id="1598">And those who did not want to be a burden to -- and consider whatever the <span class="building">HIAS</span> is doing -- I mean, I considered it as charity; and I wanted to get away from it as quick as possible. </sentence><sentence id="1599">But to the people who did that, they really had to struggle from the bottom up. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1624">A: Well I was moping around and my mother was working and I did a lot of reading and all I wanted to do was read and I was very anxious to improve my English. </sentence><sentence id="1625">I did a lot of reading, and my mother didn't like the idea of my being <span class="building">home</span> by myself all the time. </sentence><sentence id="1626">So she told some young woman that she knew that she should take me out with her when--whenever. </sentence><sentence id="1627">And there was a dance in the <span class="building">Y</span>, and she -- we went up there. </sentence><sentence id="1628">She somehow disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="1629">I was left up there. </sentence><sentence id="1630">And my husband asked me to dance, but I didn't really -- I wasn't really thinking of dating and I really didn't want to go out. </sentence><sentence id="1631">So, "Well, I'll just dance for the evening, and then I went <span class="building">home</span>." </sentence><sentence id="1632">And he wanted to walk with me, and I didn't let him. </sentence><sentence id="1633">And then there was the <span class="building">city hall</span> -- this was in <span class="populated place">Paterson</span> and the <span class="building">city hall</span> was in the middle of the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1634">And I was walking along one <span class="dlf">street</span>; he was walking along another <span class="dlf">street</span>, trying to catch up with me. </sentence><sentence id="1635">And he met me at the <span class="dlf">bus stop</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1636">And after that, he started dating me. </sentence><sentence id="1637">That's what happened. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1652">Q: Is there anything you would like to add? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1654">A: Well, I'm sure there are a lot of things. </sentence><sentence id="1655">And it's like taking an exam -- when you, you know, later on you walk out of there. </sentence><sentence id="1656">That's what always happened to me. </sentence><sentence id="1657">I did work my way through <span class="building">college</span>, and I did work my way through <span class="building">grad school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1658">And I have a degree in a Bachelor's Degree in History, and a Master's Degree in Literature. </sentence><sentence id="1659">And I know when I walked out of and into the <span class="dlf">parking lot</span>, I remembered all the correct answers. </sentence><sentence id="1660">So -- and I'm sure that I'll say -- as soon as I walk away from here, I'll think, "Oh, I should have mentioned this. </sentence><sentence id="1661">And I should have mentioned that." </sentence><sentence id="1662">So maybe I'll have a chance to talk to you again, and you can put it on tape. </sentence><sentence id="1663">And if there's anything you want to ask me, of course, I'll be glad to tell you. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1680">A: Glad I can do something that will keep this in front of the public, so that eventually people will know that it really happened. </sentence><sentence id="1681">Perhaps it can be a warning to the people, to the world. </sentence><sentence id="1682">We're trying in our little way, I think all of us, all the survivors, are trying in a little way to say, "This is what happened. </sentence><sentence id="1683">Beware, don't fall into this sort of inhumanity." </sentence><sentence id="1684"> 7 [Conclusion of Interview]   </sentence></p></dialogue>
