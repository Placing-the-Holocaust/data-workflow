<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="29">A: I think it might have been--I might be off about a year--the second or third year, the second or third grade, possibly. </sentence><sentence id="30">I must have been around 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 years old; 10 years old, that period. </sentence><sentence id="31">So it was already before "33, because I think I was 12 years old in 1933 when Hitler came to power. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="68">Q: Your father, I believe, was a World War I veteran. </sentence><sentence id="69">How did he feel about <span class="country">Germany</span> and how did he feel about things like this? </sentence><sentence id="70">Did he ever talk about it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="74">A: I don't remember talking to my father about it. </sentence><sentence id="75">No. </sentence><sentence id="76">I might have, but I don't remember it. </sentence><sentence id="77">You see, until very recently, until about a year ago, I had a total memory block. </sentence><sentence id="78">And I went to several psychiatrists and psychologists in my <span class="populated place">home town</span>, in <span class="populated place">Indianapolis</span>. </sentence><sentence id="79">I didn't...when we were negotiating with the Germany government for restitution, loss of property, loss of education, and all that, I could not fill in all the lengthy questionnaires that I was sent by the German government; because I didn't remember the name of the <span class="building">school</span> I attended, I didn't remember the name of the <span class="dlf">street</span> I lived on. </sentence><sentence id="80">And if it wouldn't have been followed by a brother, I wouldn't have got a penny. </sentence><sentence id="81">About a year ago, I started writing about it and things started coming back more and more, but there is still some, some <span class="dlf">blocks</span> there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="90">Q: Can you remember the very first time you ever heard about Hitler, not necessarily 1933? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="92">What did he mean to you very early on as a child? </sentence><sentence id="93">Was it ever discussed at <span class="building">home</span> or amongst your friends or other Jewish families that you knew? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="94">A: Well, all I can tell you is that--(cough) excuse me--I should proceed that by saying that I considered myself almost a German, foremost. </sentence><sentence id="95">I had heard about Zionism, and we negated it. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="96">I was a German of the Jewish faith. </sentence><sentence id="97">So were my parents. </sentence><sentence id="98">As you said, my father was a veteran of World War I. And when we heard about the Nazis, it was a passing political phenomena. </sentence><sentence id="99">Like many policies. </sentence><sentence id="100">I do remember once, I don't know when it was, some bloody street fights between a communist and the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="101">And I do remember as if it was some sort of pin (ph); and several of my friends, maybe my parents, belonged to the SDP (Social Democratic Partv) . </sentence><sentence id="102">which was a maioritv <span class="building">nartv</span>. </sentence><sentence id="103">sent -- And others wore  maybe the Nazis were affecting you. </sentence><sentence id="104">Not the <span class="dlf">street</span> fights? </sentence><sentence id="105">But you yourself? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="106">A: I think that was the outgrowth of the <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span>...the Nuremberg Laws. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="108">Q: It would help me considerably, rather than just answering my question, if you could say something like, "I remember this for me started in <span class="country">Europe</span>." </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="110">A: Okay, I think it was...[ remember it when I was told I could no longer do certain things. </sentence><sentence id="111">I could no longer participate in sports, contact sports. </sentence><sentence id="112">Uh, soccor. </sentence><sentence id="113">I could no longer participate, unless the ski team--I did considerable ski racing; slalom and long distance. </sentence><sentence id="114">I could... It really hit me I wanted to go to the <span class="building">opera</span>. </sentence><sentence id="115">I was no longer permitted to go to the <span class="building">opera</span>. </sentence><sentence id="116">I saw the sign "Jews are Forbidden. </sentence><sentence id="117">Prohibited to Jews." </sentence><sentence id="118">Wherever we went, we saw more and more of the <span class="spatial object">signs</span>. </sentence><sentence id="119">That is when it really hit me that I was not just a German of the Jewish religion. </sentence><sentence id="120">I was different. </sentence><sentence id="121">Which, until that period, it really hadn't sunk in. </sentence><sentence id="122">But then it did. </sentence><sentence id="123">So it was in the mid "30's that I realized that the <span class="spatial object">vise</span> had tightened a little bit, and we were made to stand out and we were different. </sentence><sentence id="124">And made to suffer for it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="140">Q: Were you made to feel different in the <span class="dlf">street</span>? </sentence><sentence id="141">You weren't allowed to go, how did people respond to you? </sentence><sentence id="142">Did you find it on a <span class="interior space">personal level</span> that things were changing? </sentence><sentence id="143">Tell me something about that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="148">A: Well, on a personal level, I felt it in <span class="building">school</span> and in sports and when you wanted to participate in certain public events. </sentence><sentence id="149">I couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="150">So many <span class="region">areas</span> were restricted. </sentence><sentence id="151">I think that is the only way I can remember it. </sentence><sentence id="152">I was still active in a very disciplined, highly disciplined, semi-militaristic youth organization, Jewish youth organization by the name of Scwartzefahnlein--Black Pennant [Ger: "Black Squad"). </sentence><sentence id="153">I joined it when I was about 8 and one half years old. </sentence><sentence id="154">And as I said, it was a rather militaristic pseudo-scouting organization. </sentence><sentence id="155">And this is when I had really my best times. </sentence><sentence id="156">I enjoyed life tremendously. </sentence><sentence id="157">And I have many, some fond memories. </sentence><sentence id="158">In retrospect, I am surprised that my parents let me go on a 6 weeks hike when I was 8 and one half years old. </sentence><sentence id="159">It was compared to scouting standards, very tough, just to get to scout. </sentence><sentence id="160">I believe I was let loose in the middle of of the <span class="env feature">woods</span> at night, and find your way <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="161">This sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="162">And we tramped...hiked all of the way from <span class="populated place">Breslau</span> [Pol: <span class="populated place">Wroc_aw</span>] north to the <span class="env feature">Baltic Sea</span>, then took a <span class="spatial object">freighter</span> around to bypass a <span class="dlf">Polish corridor</span>, to the <span class="region">lake area</span> of east of <span class="country">Poland</span>--as the Polish called it--and hiked to an <span class="env feature">island</span> where we stayed for 4 weeks. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="178">Q: This was a <span class="building">Jewish youth organization</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="180">A: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="182">Q: Did you have any non-Jewish friends at this time. </sentence><sentence id="183">Did they change at the time of <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span>, or didn't you have any non-Jewish friends? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="186">A: Iam glad you asked that. </sentence><sentence id="187">I did have non-Jewish friends, up to about "35. </sentence><sentence id="188">After that, I was absolutely ostracized. </sentence><sentence id="189">I lost all friends I had. </sentence><sentence id="190">I did not exist anymore for my non-Jewish  friends. </sentence><sentence id="191">They wouldn't dare to be seen with a Jew. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="198">Q: Did they say anything to you at all? </sentence><sentence id="199">Did anybody ever apologize for the change? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="202">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="203">No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="206">Q: Did you try to make contact with them or did you retreat"? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="208">A: Well, I guess in the beginning you walked up to a boy and tried to talk to him like you always did. </sentence><sentence id="209">And you were left standing when he turned around and walked away. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="212">Q: After "35, were you still ? </sentence><sentence id="213">Did you have to give you name, and who you were, and what your father did? </sentence><sentence id="214">Was there any change in response then? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="218">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="219">No. </sentence><sentence id="220">You see, <span class="building">German school</span> was very disciplined as it was. </sentence><sentence id="221">and I don't when that incident happened. </sentence><sentence id="222">But to give an example, I don't know it was regular behavior, corporal punishment, I was very good in <span class="building">gym</span>. </sentence><sentence id="223">As a gymnast. </sentence><sentence id="224">And we once did a formation in calisthenics. </sentence><sentence id="225">It was new to me. </sentence><sentence id="226">And I was bad to the kid next to me and watched what it was going to be when it was finished. </sentence><sentence id="227">And the teacher heard it, he walked up to me, and slapped my face and I wound up on the <span class="interior space">floor</span> and I think that's when, perhaps, my hearing suffered somewhat. </sentence><sentence id="228">It is this sort of aggressive behavior by some teachers, was made perhaps more aggressive later than in the beginning, but quite frankly I don't remember exactly what happened where, when. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="240">Q: When did you family start to talk about the changed situation after 1935? </sentence><sentence id="241">Or did they talk? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="244">Was it an unmentioned subject? </sentence><sentence id="245">Did life just carry on? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="246">A: Life carried on. </sentence><sentence id="247">You have to carry on. </sentence><sentence id="248">And especially on adverse conditions, you carry on. </sentence><sentence id="249">We talked about it occasionally, yes; especially since we had the <span class="building">matzah factory</span>, which was <span class="populated place">bolaba</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="250">Now it was like many <span class="building">synagogues</span>. </sentence><sentence id="251">Not visible on the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="252">Many <span class="building">synagogues</span> in <span class="country">Europe</span> were in the <span class="dlf">yard</span> behind the <span class="building">building</span>, which was closed off with a <span class="dlf">iron gate</span>, you know. </sentence><sentence id="253">You had to have access to it. </sentence><sentence id="254">And then you go through the <span class="dlf">yard</span>, and the <span class="building">building</span> was behind it. </sentence><sentence id="255">So it was only those people that knew; but occasionally there was some vandalism. </sentence><sentence id="256">But not much more. </sentence><sentence id="257">Surprisingly, my father, as I said, was a very nice, easy-going, mild- mannered man, who helped a lot of people. </sentence><sentence id="258">The factory workers that lived in the <span class="building">tenement houses</span>, the <span class="building">apartment house</span> that we owned in front of the <span class="building">factory</span>, they adored him. </sentence><sentence id="259">They would do anything for him. </sentence><sentence id="260">He always helped them out. </sentence><sentence id="261">Give them money. </sentence><sentence id="262">So he never had any problems. </sentence><sentence id="263">Not even at <span class="populated place">Kristallnacht</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="282">Q: Do you think his German workers felt okay about him being Jewish? </sentence><sentence id="283">Or were most of the workers Jewish? </sentence><sentence id="284">Or were they Germans? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="288">A: All Germans. </sentence><sentence id="289">But I guess it was perhaps their livelihoods that they perhaps protected. </sentence><sentence id="290">I don't know. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="291">Q: Do you remember anything special about... Do you remember... You said you were interested in <span class="building">gym</span>. </sentence><sentence id="292">Do you remember the Olympic games? </sentence><sentence id="293">Do you remember thinking anything about the Olympic games? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="294">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="295">No. </sentence><sentence id="296">No. [ </sentence><sentence id="297">heard about it from my wife cause she was a swimmer. </sentence><sentence id="298">And she is from <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="299">And they wanted...she also was not permitted anymore on a <span class="building">swim team</span>. </sentence><sentence id="300">But they lived close to a <span class="building">Olympic stadium</span>, and she told me about it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="308">Q: Let's move on now a couple of years. </sentence><sentence id="309">Let's move on to just before Kristallnacht. </sentence><sentence id="310">How were things changed from "35 to "38, as far as you were concerned? </sentence><sentence id="311">You were now a young man, 12 or 13? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="316">A: Yah. </sentence><sentence id="317">Well, it was about when I was 14 years old, things got very bad in <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="318">I remember the principal coming in once and said, "We don't want the Jew Heppner in this <span class="building">school</span> anymore. </sentence><sentence id="319">Out!" </sentence><sentence id="320">So I left <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="321">When I was 14 years old. </sentence><sentence id="322">Iam a kick-out. </sentence><sentence id="323">I took some classes in <span class="building">private school</span>, whatever; and then my mother knew somebody who owned a <span class="interior space">machine yard</span>--<span class="spatial object">industrial machinery</span>, <span class="spatial object">locomotives</span>, like all the steam equipment. </sentence><sentence id="324">And everybody at that time learned a practical craft, in preparation for possible immigration. </sentence><sentence id="325">And I was good with my hands. </sentence><sentence id="326">I am almost ambidextrous. </sentence><sentence id="327">Actually, when I was left handed, I was forced to learn my writing with my right hand. </sentence><sentence id="328">So I took several courses. </sentence><sentence id="329">I learned welding, I learned locksmithing, I learned out to pick locks, and then I became a volunteer, (ph), that is the name for it. </sentence><sentence id="330">Not an apprentice, but as an apprentice with minimal pay; because we didn't need the money. </sentence><sentence id="331">My parents knew the owner. </sentence><sentence id="332">So I was working there in the <span class="dlf">yard</span>, welding and cutting and working in the <span class="building">office</span>. </sentence><sentence id="333">I knew how to type. </sentence><sentence id="334">I maintained the petty cash. </sentence><sentence id="335">They had a <span class="building">gas station</span>; pumped gas, and learned all kind of things. </sentence><sentence id="336">One interesting experience I remember, after I took the course in welding, it was a fairly warm August day, I was asked to cut, with a torch, heavy steam piping. </sentence><sentence id="337">And I took the torch and I didn't have my overhauls and I cut off the umbrella bags, put them around my waist, took a piece of wire and fastened it, and another fella helped me turn the heavy piping while I was cutting away. </sentence><sentence id="338">And I smelled some smoke and the flames started shooting up and ignited the <span class="spatial object">umbrella bags</span>. </sentence><sentence id="339">But I had learned what to do, and I hit the <span class="env feature">ground</span> and rolled and just lost some of my sweater and shirt and eyebrows and hair. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="365">Q: Were your fellow workers Jewish or German or German-Jewish? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="367">A: The foreman of the <span class="dlf">yard</span>, the yard foreman, was an SA man, Brown Shirt. </sentence><sentence id="368">Was an everyday German. </sentence><sentence id="369">Very business-like. </sentence><sentence id="370">Around the <span class="dlf">yard</span>. </sentence><sentence id="371">No problems. </sentence><sentence id="372">I never knew if he was one of those that were more or less voluntarily had entered the <span class="building">Brownshirts</span>, or not. </sentence><sentence id="373">Incidentally, later, Kristallnacht, he did not... Well, I will get to that later, perhaps. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2250">A: Because they took the flour to the <span class="building">barracks</span>, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2251">They found me among the flour at the rear of the <span class="spatial object">truck</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2252">But they didn't know what to do with me and tried to beat me up. </sentence><sentence id="2253">Not much happened and the next day I was released because Mr. Wallach paid $500,000 for me, in Chinese currency. </sentence><sentence id="2254">That must have been, maybe, $200 some dollars. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2260">Q: You were taken into a <span class="building">Chinese puppet barrack</span> because you were in back of the <span class="dlf">lorrie</span> which was stealing. </sentence><sentence id="2261">Then you were released. </sentence><sentence id="2262">Who paid the money to release you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2266">A: Mr. Wallach. </sentence><sentence id="2267">He wanted the flour back. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2270">Q: The owner of the <span class="building">bakery</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2272">A: We got the flour, we got the flour back so we could at least furnish part of the bread for the <span class="populated place">camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2273">See the <span class="populated place">camps</span> were very badly off because the <span class="building">Joint</span> had stopped sending money to <span class="populated place">Shanghai</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2274">The <span class="building">State Department</span>, under the act of trading with the enemy act, you could not lawfully or legally transfer funds to the Japanese occupation in <span class="populated place">Shanghai</span> and they didn't take a hint as I understand to route the money to other <span class="country">countries</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2275">So these poor Jews in the <span class="populated place">camps</span> had to get by on 3 cents per day per person. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2280">Q: How did you get 3 cents? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2282">A: I had a job. </sentence><sentence id="2283">I am talking about those 8,000, 9,000 that were in <span class="populated place">camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2284">They were down to nothing. </sentence><sentence id="2285">Some of them didn't even have literally a shirt or trousers anymore. </sentence><sentence id="2286">They were walking along with burlap bags around them. </sentence><sentence id="2287">We lost about a total of 3,000 people out of 18,000 to the starvation, disease, heat prostration, some due to Japanese torture, malnutrition. </sentence><sentence id="2288">What bothers me in this whole period is that so many Jews could have left <span class="country">Germany</span>, could have left the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2296">Q: You said there was malnutrition. </sentence><sentence id="2297">Does that mean there was lawlessness as well? </sentence><sentence id="2298">How was the <span class="populated place">community</span> cohering at this point? </sentence><sentence id="2299">Was there a sense of community still at this point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2304">A: Yes, very well disciplined as a whole. </sentence><sentence id="2305">I do remember, I heard about one case, a lawyer--a Austrian gentleman--was caught stealing a piece of bread from somebody else in the <span class="spatial object">bunk</span> next to him. </sentence><sentence id="2306">And he was so embarrassed he committed suicide. </sentence><sentence id="2307">All in all, the discipline among the <span class="populated place">community</span> was extraordinary. </sentence><sentence id="2308">There was practically no criminality. </sentence><sentence id="2309">I think during the ten year period there were two murders. </sentence><sentence id="2310">We governed ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="2311">We had our own community organization, did our own <span class="building">arbitration court</span>, the right to appeal. </sentence><sentence id="2312">So it was really well functioned. </sentence><sentence id="2313">What did not function so well was the various committees. </sentence><sentence id="2314">They didn't have experience, until the <span class="building">Joint</span>--and Ms. [Laura] Margolies there from the <span class="building">Joint</span>, who was a trained social worker. </sentence><sentence id="2315">She arrived sometime in 1941, and then she was interned as an enemy. </sentence><sentence id="2316"> 6 So she had only a few scant months to really do a job. </sentence><sentence id="2317">But whatever she did, she did extremely effectively. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2332">Q: How did most of the community that survived in <span class="populated place">Shanghai</span> survive? </sentence><sentence id="2333">Was it because of the Joint? </sentence><sentence id="2334">Could that be true? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2338">A: No, that wouldn't be fair. </sentence><sentence id="2339">Because the <span class="building">Joint</span>, I think, sent until the war ended, I think maybe...I don't have the amount. </sentence><sentence id="2340">Maybe $2-1/2 million. </sentence><sentence id="2341">But, you see, that was before <span class="country">Israel</span>, before the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="2342">The <span class="building">Joint</span> was in the business of raising money. </sentence><sentence id="2343">But there was no money. </sentence><sentence id="2344">They didn't have it. </sentence><sentence id="2345">And, unfortunately, some Jews from the <span class="building">Shanghai Council</span> tried to persuade and cabled back to <span class="country">Europe</span>, "Do not send any more Jews here." </sentence><sentence id="2346">And the American government finally cabled to various other <span class="building">steamship agencies</span>, tried to prevent more Jews from going to <span class="populated place">Shanghai</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2347">And Jewish organizations were involved in that. </sentence><sentence id="2348">To prevent more Jews from going to <span class="populated place">Shanghai</span>, because there was no money there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2361">Q: New Jews in <span class="populated place">Shanghai</span> would say the same thing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2363">A: These were the old time Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2364">Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2367">Q: I believe you were arrested on one occasion? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2369">A: Yes, it was just shortly before <span class="populated place">Pearl Harbor</span>, fortunately. </sentence><sentence id="2370">We were on a scout trip on <span class="spatial object">bicycles</span> on a Sunday, came to an <span class="region">area</span> outside <span class="populated place">Shanghai</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2371">We had no green, we had no <span class="dlf">lawn</span>, no <span class="env feature">trees</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2372">Nothing. </sentence><sentence id="2373">And besides, I wanted to see what was going on around <span class="populated place">Shanghai</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2374">So we had a fox hunt. </sentence><sentence id="2375">You know what it is. </sentence><sentence id="2376">Yah. </sentence><sentence id="2377">A fox hunt is one fellow on a <span class="spatial object">bike</span> would lead the way; and we didn't have paper. </sentence><sentence id="2378">Paper was very precious and hard to come by. </sentence><sentence id="2379">Had a handful of rice and scatter it, and the hounds would try to follow the fox and find it. </sentence><sentence id="2380">And we got to <span class="populated place">village</span> where the chickens had already picked up the rice. </sentence><sentence id="2381">But, anyway, we finally find the fox. </sentence><sentence id="2382">He got into <span class="region">Japanese barracks area</span>, <span class="region">military area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2383">And there is a Japanese guard. </sentence><sentence id="2384">And there is a foreigner on a <span class="spatial object">bike</span> scattering rice on the <span class="env feature">ground</span>, which is a holy concept. </sentence><sentence id="2385">Symbolic. </sentence><sentence id="2386">Same as bread to us. </sentence><sentence id="2387">So he arrested him. </sentence><sentence id="2388">And one after another, we got in the <span class="dlf">trap</span> until they had all of us. </sentence><sentence id="2389">And no communication. </sentence><sentence id="2390">And so we finally got on a <span class="spatial object">truck</span>, tossed on a <span class="spatial object">truck</span>; we were hustled on the <span class="spatial object">truck</span>, and driven to <span class="building">headquarters</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2391">Behind the <span class="building">headquarters</span> was a <span class="building">building</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2392">One side was a <span class="building">building</span>, and the other side was a <span class="dlf">rifle range</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2393">Saw the <span class="spatial object">targets</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="2394">And there were several squads doing target practice; and they line us up there. </sentence><sentence id="2395">It was not a very comfortable feeling. </sentence><sentence id="2396">We didn't know what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="2397">And knowing the Japanese, you see, you shoot first and ask questions later. </sentence><sentence id="2398">We are so used to seeing dead people, babies, every day in the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2399">The life is absolutely nothing there. </sentence><sentence id="2400">I have seen people murdered point blank there. </sentence><sentence id="2401">So we started communicating, but they called some Japanese which was <span class="populated place">POWs camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2402">Apparently from there, they came from a different <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2403">They couldn't understand our <span class="country">China</span>....Chinese Kaishengka dialect. </sentence><sentence id="2404">So things didn't look good. </sentence><sentence id="2405">All ofa sudden, they tried to find out who we are and what we are doing. </sentence><sentence id="2406">So my friend--who is in <span class="country">Australia</span> now--said, "Deutschka (ph)."--Deutsche, in Japanese. " </sentence><sentence id="2407">Deutschka? </sentence><sentence id="2408">Deutschka?" </sentence><sentence id="2409">So everything was on hold. </sentence><sentence id="2410">So sometime later, the <span class="spatial object">staff car</span> came up. </sentence><sentence id="2411">High  7 ranking officers jumped out. </sentence><sentence id="2412">And as you may know, Japanese officers are sent to <span class="country">Germany</span> for training. </sentence><sentence id="2413">Out came two officers who spoke fair German. " </sentence><sentence id="2414">Who are you? </sentence><sentence id="2415">What are you?" </sentence><sentence id="2416">You try to explain fox hunt to them. </sentence><sentence id="2417">But we could at least tell them we are Germans. </sentence><sentence id="2418">We were stateless, you see. </sentence><sentence id="2419">As stateless, we have less right than a dog ina <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2420">They could shoot us, and nobody else would ask questions. </sentence><sentence id="2421">So we heard that he called an aide and talked to him; and the aide disappeared while he talked to us. </sentence><sentence id="2422">And the aide came back shaking his head. </sentence><sentence id="2423">And then he said...he let us go. </sentence><sentence id="2424">Promised to never come to this <span class="region">area</span> again, and had to promise we would meet him and give him German lessons. </sentence><sentence id="2425">Later on, I found out through Pat--my British contact--he had called the <span class="building">German Embassy</span> to verify who we were and nobody answered. </sentence><sentence id="2426">If he would have found out we are not Germans but Jews in a <span class="region">restricted area</span> there... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2495">A: No, she kept her job until she... I had a letter from Miss Margolies of the <span class="building">Joint</span>, as a matter of fact. </sentence><sentence id="2496">She had to be discharged, because there were no more funds for her anymore. </sentence><sentence id="2497">So we had <span class="interior space">soup kitchens</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2498">We lived in one part of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>; and my wife lived in another part of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> with her father. </sentence><sentence id="2499">And then I moved in there. </sentence><sentence id="2500">My mother also had a handcrafted fur coat, that she had done in <span class="populated place">Krakow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2501">The <span class="building">Polish furriers</span> were the best in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="2502">And she had smuggled it across the <span class="dlf">border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2503">And she had this; and she sold this to the General Manager of Standard Oil of the <span class="region">Far East</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2504">And we lived on that for, I think, about three years. </sentence><sentence id="2505">So we sold all our belongings. </sentence><sentence id="2506">A <span class="spatial object">Parker fountain pen</span> would become a symbol for Chinese businessmen. </sentence><sentence id="2507">Brought good money. </sentence><sentence id="2508">We sold everything down to what we just...the bare necessities, you see. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2523">Q: What did it do to you? </sentence><sentence id="2524">You felt German when you left? </sentence><sentence id="2525">Did you feel more Jewish as a result of being there? </sentence><sentence id="2526">How did it actually affect you, <span class="populated place">Shanghai</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2531">A: Well, I must say, before we emigrated, we finally didn't eat kosher anymore. </sentence><sentence id="2532">It wasn't possible. </sentence><sentence id="2533">You said, you know, this is really not the intent of being a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="2534">You wouldn't be any less of a Jew by not eating kosher. </sentence><sentence id="2535">So having solved that problem, I would say, as a whole the <span class="populated place">community</span> became tighter knit. </sentence><sentence id="2536">And those Jews that were perhaps Agnostics or not religious at all--Atheists--became conscious Jews again. </sentence><sentence id="2537">Very much so. </sentence><sentence id="2538">We had holiday services with our own <span class="building">synagogues</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2539">We had quite a few rabbis there, services, it was a very integrated Jewish life there. </sentence><sentence id="2540">Perhaps like a <span class="populated place">shtetl</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2541">The foretaste of life in <span class="country">Israel</span> in a way. </sentence><sentence id="2542">Very cohesive <span class="populated place">bible community</span>; based on nothing, financially. </sentence><sentence id="2543">But it worked. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2557">Q: Why would religious feelings become stronger? </sentence><sentence id="2558"><span class="country">Europe</span> was in wreckage, people were refuges, what was it that was pulling people back to Judaism? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2561">A: Well, I think it was adversity, to try to survive on a daily basis. </sentence><sentence id="2562">I think that must be it. </sentence><sentence id="2563">People seemed religious. </sentence><sentence id="2564">I think when people are on dire straits, you know, perhaps they turn to God again. </sentence><sentence id="2565"> 8 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2571">Q: Those people that you knew there, tell me what actually happened to the <span class="populated place">community</span>? </sentence><sentence id="2572">What became of the <span class="populated place">community</span>? </sentence><sentence id="2573">You, yourself, got to <span class="country">America</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2574">What about the rest of the <span class="populated place">community</span>? </sentence><sentence id="2575">How may died? </sentence><sentence id="2576">What happened to them? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2611">A: Well, those that had relatives and an affidavit, of course, went to the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2612">Quite a few went to <span class="country">Australia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2613">Those that couldn't get a visa from the <span class="country">United States</span> or didn't pass the very stringent health requirements went to <span class="country">Israel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2614">By that time <span class="country">Israel</span> had gained its independence, and they went to <span class="country">Israel</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2627">A: Well, I think it was a conglomerate. </sentence><sentence id="2628">It was, of course, Kristallnacht, seeing the <span class="building">temple</span>, and seeing the free world stand by. </sentence><sentence id="2629">In retrospect the free world knew what was happening and didn't move a finger. </sentence><sentence id="2630">I saw how anti-semitism really preceded the whole Hitler period. </sentence><sentence id="2631">The <span class="region">free world</span> must share in the responsibility of what happened to 12 million people there, 6 out of the 12 million were 6 million Jews, and the lack of help originally by the <span class="building">Joint Distribution Commitee</span> that was unable to raise money and send professionals there. </sentence><sentence id="2632">That was unfortunate. </sentence><sentence id="2633">Later on, the <span class="building">Joint</span> really got money back, got communication again through <span class="region">neutral counties</span>, to feed the thousands of Jews there. </sentence><sentence id="2634">The <span class="building">Joint</span> did a tremendous job. </sentence><sentence id="2635">I don't want to take anything away from the <span class="building">Joint</span>, but the beginning, it was a disaster. </sentence><sentence id="2636">So what it meant to me, I think it was a <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2637">A tough <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2655">A: Well, I think it has a meaning. </sentence><sentence id="2656">It is definitely of importance for the younger generation, Jews and otherwise, to know what happened, because I think we have to involve ourselves in  9 Jewish life and in community life. </sentence><sentence id="2657">We have to make sure that we involve ourselves in a democratic process, especially here in the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2658">Because if we don't, if we are apathetic as the whole population is and the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span> is, we may wake up one day under a dictatorship. </sentence><sentence id="2659">Most of the people are turned out by politics and politicians. </sentence><sentence id="2660">And this is the danger that I see. </sentence></p></dialogue>
