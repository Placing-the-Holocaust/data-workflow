<body><dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1">So on his way back, he stopped off in <span class="populated place">Paris</span> and he stayed for about a weekend there and when he left he asked me to marry him. </sentence><sentence id="2">And | wasn't sure, you know, | mean, you know | wasn't so sure | wanted to go off to the <span class="country">United States</span> and | wasn't so sure | wanted to marry him. </sentence><sentence id="3">But on, when he got back to the <span class="country">United States</span>, he went through <span class="populated place">New York</span> on his way to <span class="populated place">Washington</span> to be debriefed and he saw Jim and he told Jim. </sentence><sentence id="4">Actually he didn't tell him he was going to marry me, but he told him that he had spent time with me and that | might come to the <span class="country">United States</span>, because what happened was | said, "Well, I'm not so sure | want to get married." </sentence><sentence id="5">And he was looking for other ways and we had started applications for a <span class="building">Fullbright</span> for me to go to <span class="populated place">Princeton</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6">So he told Jim that | might come to <span class="populated place">Princeton</span> on a <span class="spatial object">Fullbright</span> and when Jim heard that, he sold his <span class="spatial object">car</span>, he took his money and he came back to <span class="country">Europe</span>. </sentence><sentence id="7">And about three weeks later we were married. </sentence><sentence id="8">So that's how it happened, that | met Jim, | got married and from then on my life in <span class="country">France</span> was finished and | was moving to the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="9">So | came to the <span class="country">United States</span> as a bride of an American, who knew very little English and who had to find her way again in a new <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="10">| must say it was a challenge, it took me a couple of years to, to really get the better of it. </sentence><sentence id="11">But | had to get a job right away and | gota very good job with a, a <span class="building">French government office</span> in <span class="populated place">New York</span>, it was a <span class="building">French film office</span>, which was a very glamorous job, everybody envied me because | was receptionist, but | was also squiring around the French movie stars when they came to <span class="populated place">Paris</span> for the release of their pictures, so it was a very glamorous job | had. </sentence><sentence id="12">And Jim worked for <span class="building">NBC</span> and we had about four single years like that, where we really, | really got to enjoy <span class="populated place">New York</span> and learn the language and you know, and try to fit myself in to the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="13">And then we had a child after four years, Laura, our daughter, who is 35 now and we moved to a <span class="building">house</span> on <span class="region">Long Island</span>. </sentence><sentence id="14">Actually we moved to another <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="15">| really got used to living in the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="16">And then we had a son and after we had two children we decided we better buy a <span class="building">house</span>, so we bought a <span class="building">house</span> on <span class="region">Long Island</span>. </sentence><sentence id="17">| have to explain when I'm saying we bought a <span class="building">house</span>, it seems like a landmark. </sentence><sentence id="18">All my friends wanted <span class="building">houses</span>, | didn't want a <span class="building">house</span> because | never wanted possessions because it scared me to own things. </sentence><sentence id="19">So it took Jim awhile to talk me into for us to move into a <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="20">But eventually | realized that he was right, you know, with two children you don't live in an <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, it's nicer to have a <span class="dlf">yard</span> and to have <span class="spatial object">swings</span> and such. </sentence><sentence id="21">So we moved into a very nice <span class="building">house</span> on <span class="region">Long Island</span> and the children started going to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="22">By then Laura started <span class="building">kindergarten</span> on <span class="region">Long Island</span> and Eric pretty soon started <span class="building">nursery school</span>, where | think | spent more time than he did because | was very often a volunteer there and lived the American suburban life, you know and that was again a different kind of life | tried to fit myself into. </sentence><sentence id="23">So first | was working and then | was a mother and then at one point, Jim had an idea for a publication, an index to congressional documents and for that we had to move to <span class="populated place">Washington</span>. </sentence><sentence id="24">So here we This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="25">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="26"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection were with two small children, two young children, packed up everything and came to <span class="populated place">Washington</span> to start a new project. </sentence><sentence id="27">And Jim made it perfectly clear that he couldn't do it on his own, | had to be part of it, | had to be his partner. </sentence><sentence id="28">So | had two small children and for a period of 10 years | managed to somehow to be a mother and a homemaker and a cook and also at the same time, create a system for, by which we collected documents on <span class="populated place">Capital Hill</span>, made contacts in every committee, learned my way around the American government, including what it does and how to best bring on the control of this unwieldy output of paper that the American government produces. </sentence><sentence id="29">And we did. </sentence><sentence id="30">We started a very successful business together and we run that business creating indexes for research and <span class="building">academic libraries</span>, which are extremely valuable. </sentence><sentence id="31">And we run that company for about 10 years and then we sold it, we sold it to a Dutch company, Elsoveer(ph), but the company's still going on and most of the people we hired are still there, hired and trained. </sentence><sentence id="32">First | started doing the, the set up of the system on <span class="populated place">Capital Hill</span> on how to collect all those documents and when that was under control, | put two people in charge of that and then | had to come in because by then we had lots of people working for us and Jim was the creative man, doing the indexing and the dealing with computers, but somebody had to take care of personnel and administration because at one point we were each 300 people, so that was a large <span class="building">business</span> and it needed ... so | came in and | took over administration personnel and | created salary administration systems which I'd, | only stayed one step ahead because | would take seminars and then decide, you know, how we needed to do it and administration, we had a <span class="building">plant</span> by then, producing microfiche and | was in charge of the <span class="building">plant</span> also, which employed about 75 people, which was out in Rockville(ph) Excuse me. ( </sentence><sentence id="33">pause). </sentence><sentence id="34">Okay, so where did we stop, yes, so we were running this very large business and | was in charge of personnel and administration in the <span class="building">plant</span> and Jim was in charge of the editorial end of it and after 10 years we sold the company. </sentence><sentence id="35">It was an unusual company, was one of the first of information retrieval companies that we had created and was an extremely valuable company and it made <span class="building">Wall Street</span> history, because of, you know, of the era it sort of brought in to the <span class="country">United States</span> business world. </sentence><sentence id="36">We were extremely proud of that company because not only did we create tools which were very valuable for researchers in <span class="populated place">academic places</span>, but also it became a tool for <span class="building">law offices</span>, there isn't a <span class="building">law office</span> that doesn't have our index, when they used to create legislative histories, | don't know if they still need it as badly, but there was a long period of time where a <span class="building">law office</span> couldn't operate without our index because that told them immediately what was going on on <span class="populated place">Capital Hill</span>, to follow through a piece of legislation, from the various stages, with all it's documents, you know, attached to it and whereas they used to have to employ people with long hours to create those histories, they, from us they could do it almost immediately with our tools. </sentence><sentence id="37">So it was not only a profitable company, but it was a useful thing to have created. </sentence><sentence id="38">And we also ran a very unusual This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="39">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="40"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this <span class="spatial object">collection ship</span>, in terms of our employees could buy stock, they owned part of the company. </sentence><sentence id="41">We felt it's much better to share and to have employees, you know, who were loyal to a <span class="building">company</span> because it was partly theirs and also we started one of the first practices of flex time for women with children, where they could work only part-time, you know, as a consequence we got much better workers. </sentence><sentence id="42">Many intelligent women didn't want to take full-time jobs because they had young children at <span class="building">home</span> and that gave them an opportunity to do intellectual work and still have flexible hours. </sentence><sentence id="43">So we were sort of ___in many social ways too. </sentence><sentence id="44">At this point, did you want me to continue in <span class="populated place">Washington</span> or do you want me to go back a little bit to <span class="populated place">New York</span>? </sentence><sentence id="45">You wanted to ask a few questions? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="91">Q: Yeah, | wanted to go back to <span class="populated place">New York</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="93">A: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="95">Q: And tell me, did you meet up with survivors when you were in <span class="populated place">New York</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="97">A: No, no, because I, | stepped into Jim's kind of life. </sentence><sentence id="98">Jim worked for NBC, | worked for, for a company on <span class="dlf">Madison Avenue</span>, you know, a <span class="building">French office</span> and most of the people we saw were Jim's friends or the people we made friends with at work. </sentence><sentence id="99">By and large it was a crowd of reporters, television people, radio people, you know. </sentence><sentence id="100">Advertising people and mostly people like that and maybe some people whom Jim had known as a child, because in fact | had met a couple of, of people he had gone to <span class="building">high school</span> with and | became extremely friendly with one young woman who had gone to high <span class="building">school</span> with him, who stayed my best friend until she died a couple of years ago, you know, they lived in <span class="region">Connecticut</span>, but that was a couple who was extremely close to us. </sentence><sentence id="101">So | started making friends amongst the Americans, but | did not see any survivors. </sentence><sentence id="102">| don't think survivors search out other survivors. </sentence><sentence id="103">| think, particularly in my case, | wanted a normal life and | wanted to step into a normal life. </sentence><sentence id="104">| didn't want to live in the past, | didn't want to talk about what happened to me and in fact | very seldom talked about it. </sentence><sentence id="105">Most of our friends didn't know | was a Holocaust survivor. </sentence><sentence id="106">As far as they knew | cam from <span class="country">France</span> and that was it, | was learning the language, | was learning the customs, | was becoming Americanized, but they did not know | was a Holocaust survivor. </sentence><sentence id="107">In fact Jim knew very little about it, he knew, but | never talked about it and he didn't quiz me about it, so | very seldom talked about it and | did not search out any other Holocaust survivors. </sentence><sentence id="108">However, a very funny thing happened. </sentence><sentence id="109">Jim was very politically inclined always and | began to get, to take an interest in politics and we went to a Stevenson rally once in <span class="populated place">Queens</span>, a huge rally and | looked across the <span class="building">arena</span> and | saw a young girl and | said, | know this person, | knew her in <span class="populated place">Bratislava</span>. </sentence><sentence id="110">So we went up and | said, "Are you Blanca(ph)? </sentence><sentence id="111">Blanca Bruner(ph)?" </sentence><sentence id="112">and she said yes. </sentence><sentence id="113">| hadn't seen her in like what, 10, 11 years and she was just as amazed as | was that | had recognized and she recognized me too, so we sort of started contact and | wanted to see her and This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="114">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="115"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection she called me up and she told me that her father forbade her to see me. </sentence><sentence id="116">And | said, "Why? </sentence><sentence id="117">He doesn't know me." </sentence><sentence id="118">And she said, "yes, that's just it.". </sentence><sentence id="119">They were very Orthodox Jews and they didn't mix with any other Jews and she was not allowed to see me. </sentence><sentence id="120">So the only one | could have had contact with, her father cut it off, he absolutely forbade her to see me, because | was not a practicing Orthodox Jew. </sentence><sentence id="121">So that was the end of that. </sentence><sentence id="122">So to answer your question, | did not see any Holocaust survivors, | did not talk about it very often, | didn't read about it. </sentence><sentence id="123">| really concentrated all my energies on adapting myself to a normal life in the <span class="country">United States</span> and | think | succeeded pretty well, so. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="152">Q: Did you ever, at any point, feel that you were missing something, or was it just kind of, you just wanted to put that in the past. </sentence><sentence id="153">Was there a part of you that was curious, wanted that sort of bond or was it lonely? </sentence><sentence id="154">| was just ... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="158">A: Yes, there were times when it was lonely, but it was also amusing, like | would have a friend who would sit over coffee with me and cry that she had an identity crisis and here | was, | didn't know my name, | didn't know my age, | didn't know where | came from and | felt, well, I'm not any worse off then she is. </sentence><sentence id="159">She's having an identity crisis? </sentence><sentence id="160">| don't think, you know, | don't think I'm any worse off. </sentence><sentence id="161">At least | don't know, you know, it's a clean slate. </sentence><sentence id="162">So yes, | did feel at times lonely, because nobody | knew could share with me what I'd gone through, but at the same time | thought, it gave me a certain perspective where more trivial things didn't bother me the same way as they seemed to bother my friends, okay? </sentence><sentence id="163">Many of them were bothered that they didn't have, they were hoping that their careers would have been more advanced and they were busy at <span class="building">home</span> with the kids and they couldn't do this and they couldn't do that and they were very bothered. </sentence><sentence id="164">It didn't bother me to be <span class="building">home</span> with the kids. </sentence><sentence id="165">It's true that | worked until the kids were born. </sentence><sentence id="166">| tried, | had a very good job when | was pregnant with Laura and | would have liked to go back to it, but by then | was working for the <span class="building">United Nations</span> and | had a very good job. </sentence><sentence id="167">| was working for the ambassador from <span class="country">Laos</span> to the <span class="building">United Nations</span>, you know, one of the <span class="country">IndoChinese countries</span>, French speaking. </sentence><sentence id="168">| had a very good job, | mean | worked until two weeks before she was born and they wanted me back and | started negotiating and they wanted me full time and | knew | couldn't walk out of there at five o'clock and yet | had a child and | couldn't see myself leaving the child, so | decided not to work. </sentence><sentence id="169">So | made the decision voluntarily and | somehow didn't feel that | was being penalized in any way. </sentence><sentence id="170">So | had advantages that others didn't have, in a way. </sentence><sentence id="171">And then, before | even had time to turn around and feel that oh my goodness, what am | going to do with my life now that the children are going to start <span class="building">school</span>, Jim said, "We are starting a <span class="building">business</span>." </sentence><sentence id="172">And so when my son went off to <span class="building">Kindergarten</span> for half a day, | went off to work. </sentence><sentence id="173">In fact | had to rush back <span class="building">home</span> to greet him because he only had half a day of <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="174">So | never had some of the problems that | could see my friends had. </sentence><sentence id="175">| had my set of problems because | had This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="176">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="177"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection hang-ups because of my past, you know. </sentence><sentence id="178">Bult, like for instance, you know, taking care of the children, | was always very concerned that they should not catch cold and when they were sick | felt sick and things like that. </sentence><sentence id="179">I'm sure that my American counterparts didn't feel that to the same degree as | did. </sentence><sentence id="180">The anxiety over children, particularly. </sentence><sentence id="181">But on the other hand, they had other anxieties which | didn't have, so | felt I'm not doing too badly, okay, so that's how | felt about it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="207">Q: You said earlier, in another interview, that you didn't tell your children, so? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="209">A: No, | thought that and | think probably | made a mistake, because | didn't speak about it, they knew | was foreign, yeah | was French, but then, when our kids were in <span class="building">school</span>, there were several kids in classes that my daughter had, who had French parents, so that wasn't an oddity, that much of an oddity for her and | didn't feel | wanted to burden them. </sentence><sentence id="210">First of all, | felt uncomfortable myself talking about it and secondly | was very concerned not to overburden the children. </sentence><sentence id="211">So | didn't talk about it and it's only when our daughter was going to <span class="building">religious school</span>, she came back, want to stop it? </sentence><sentence id="212">She came back one day and apparently they had been discussing the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="213">You know there was a period where the Holocaust wasn't discussed to the same degree that it is being discussed now. </sentence><sentence id="214">There is an awareness now which | don't think existed at the time when | came to <span class="populated place">New York</span>. </sentence><sentence id="215">And she came <span class="building">home</span> from <span class="building">religious school</span> and she asked me am | a Holocaust survivor and | said, "yes." </sentence><sentence id="216">And she was so upset. " </sentence><sentence id="217">Why didn't you ever tell me anything about it, why didn't you say anything about it?" </sentence><sentence id="218">And | realized that | had made a mistake, she was truly upset. </sentence><sentence id="219">And from then on she just kept on digging and asking questions and this and that and | realized that | had to do an about face and face the past and come to terms with it myself, but particularly for the sake of my children. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="231">Q: How old were you at that point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="233">A: Well, let's see, Laura was born when | was 25 and at that point she must have been 11. </sentence><sentence id="234">About 36, 37. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="237">Q: How did you, in your own way, come to terms with it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="239">A: | started reading about it, because | started, | started to, trying to put some chronological order into my memories. </sentence><sentence id="240">And that's when | started talking to Jim, but mostly to female friends, | had always very close female friends. </sentence><sentence id="241">| had a couple in <span class="populated place">New York</span> who were very close to me. </sentence><sentence id="242">And so when | was ready to talk, they were listening, you know and they were always ready to listen, so | would discuss certain matters. </sentence><sentence id="243">And with Jim, too and try to put some chronological order into my memories. </sentence><sentence id="244">At that point, Jim became very helpful because he started getting me books and | would tell him recollections and then he would find books and he would This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="245">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="246"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection say, "Your recollections are correct." </sentence><sentence id="247">Like | would have recollections about what happened in the <span class="env feature">forest</span> after we escaped from <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> and he found a book, | don't remember what it is, we have a <span class="spatial object">library</span> of them by now. </sentence><sentence id="248">And sure enough, it described almost the way | had described to him what it was like. </sentence><sentence id="249">Those bands, you know, of deserters and Jewish people hiding and children and this and that and it was very accurate, so | knew that my memory wasn't playing tricks. </sentence><sentence id="250">That's the way | was trying to, you know, to deal with the, and | was able to sort of make some order out of what had happened, by talking about it and then reading up and confirming that my memories were actually accurate. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="263">Q: Did you ever join, were there survivor groups, did you ever, after that experience in <span class="populated place">New York</span>, did you meet up with anyone? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="265">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="266">As a matter of fact | have a very good friend who lives in <span class="region">New Jersey</span>, who is also a survivor. </sentence><sentence id="267">She had a somewhat different <span class="dlf">path</span> than mine, in that she was with her mother and her brother all through it, and then emigrated to <span class="country">Venezuela</span>. </sentence><sentence id="268">When they left Europe, they went to <span class="country">Venezuela</span>, so she is sort of Latin American in her outlook because she went to <span class="building">school</span> there and then she came to the <span class="country">United States</span> and she called me once that there was a group of hidden children that was meeting and | should join them and | wasn't ready. </sentence><sentence id="269">| just absolutely refused. </sentence><sentence id="270">She went to this meeting, they had written, they wrote a book, somebody at <span class="building">Yale</span>, | think a woman at <span class="building">Yale</span>, who does a lot of research in that <span class="region">area</span>, put together a book of the recollections of the hidden children and my friend was part of it and she sent me the book. </sentence><sentence id="271">You know, | read her part, | couldn't read the others. </sentence><sentence id="272">| just didn't feel | wanted to go back and dwell on it. </sentence><sentence id="273">| just couldn't read the others. </sentence><sentence id="274">And so | understood that | really wasn't ready to join that group and to share in great detail and just dwell that much. </sentence><sentence id="275">That's not my, my nature. </sentence><sentence id="276">My nature is to look ahead and | can't look, | only looked back as far as | needed to to put some order into it and to sort of present it to my children. </sentence><sentence id="277">But! </sentence><sentence id="278">don't think | want to dwell any more on that than that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="293">Q: When you say dwell, is it some of the pain and the experience of it that scares you to go back? </sentence><sentence id="294">Describe sort of what's going on in your head. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="319">Q: How did you pull yourself out of it at that time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="321">A: | think | got the help from friends. </sentence><sentence id="322">| have, | have the most incredible circle of friends and they were calling all the time and they were checking up on me and they were suggesting things we should be doing and they were bringing me books and | started reading again and | started getting involved in life. </sentence><sentence id="323">You know, life is irresistible, it's, if you start getting involved in it, it just carries you along and that's what you need to do and that's really what | did to pull myself out of it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="327">Q: All right, let's go back for a moment, you were talking about the <span class="building">business</span>. </sentence><sentence id="328">We had gotten to the point where | believe you were going to sell it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="331">A: Yes, sell it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="333">Q: Okay, so let's start up at that point and then the following years after that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="335">A: Right, okay. </sentence><sentence id="336">So we decided to sell the <span class="building">business</span> mainly because my husband, my husband's health at that point was a little shaky and he, it was, he was really suffering from extreme exhaustion, so we decided to sell the <span class="building">business</span>, but it's not so easy to sell a <span class="building">business</span> like that and it took about a year to complete the sale. </sentence><sentence id="337">And then we were staying on for awhile because it was part of our contract, so we stayed on for awhile, but then we, Jim just wanted no part of it any more, he wanted to get out of it, so we renegotiated out, we went to <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span> to renegotiate his contract and we left the <span class="building">business</span> in very good shape, you know, with very good people are there running it and it's still in excellent, it's a very good <span class="building">business</span> that they bought themselves. </sentence><sentence id="338">And then we had about a year to decide, you know, to clean up all the paperwork from the sale and the distribution of, to all the employees and all of that and then we decided to do a little bit of traveling and | think just about that time, our son went off to <span class="building">college</span>, so the <span class="interior space">nest</span> was really empty and he teases us, funny because for my 60th birthday, he gave us a whole speech, you know, they gave me a party and he made a speech and he said when he went off to This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="339">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked

he had the impression that this is the moment we were waiting for, really, because our <span class="spatial object">bags</span> must have been packed, because the minute he went off to <span class="building">college</span>, off we went. </sentence><sentence id="341">And we did a lot of traveling, we did. </sentence><sentence id="342">I'm trying to remember, | know we made a trip to <span class="country">Japan</span>, but that was still for business, this was, we did one last piece of business for the, for the company which we sold and we had some contracts with Japanese publishers and we had to go to <span class="country">Japan</span>, so we did that, which was very interesting. </sentence><sentence id="343">And we went to <span class="country">Europe</span>, we traveled with friends, with our friends from <span class="region">Connecticut</span>, you know, whom Jim has known since <span class="building">high school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="344">We went to <span class="country">Italy</span> with them, we took a trip to the south of <span class="country">France</span> with them. </sentence><sentence id="345">We had other friends we were traveling with. </sentence><sentence id="346">We went to, we went to <span class="region">Alaska</span>, we went to <span class="country">Australia</span> and <span class="country">New Zealand</span>. </sentence><sentence id="347">We really did quite a bit of traveling and | love to travel. </sentence><sentence id="348">And we enjoy it. </sentence><sentence id="349">We usually go with friends, one or two couples. </sentence><sentence id="350">We went to <span class="country">Spain</span> just recently, we went to <span class="region">eastern Europe</span> last May. </sentence><sentence id="351">So we have done quite a bit of traveling, but the first year we really did a lot of traveling, in the <span class="country">United States</span>, you know, going to the <span class="region">west coast</span>, doing just more, <span class="country">Canada</span>, more local things. </sentence><sentence id="352">And then we decided to open a different kind of <span class="building">publishing house</span> because Jim's ambition was always to be a publisher of books, not of specialized material like we had just sold, but of trade books. </sentence><sentence id="353">So we started Adler and <span class="building">Adler publishers</span>. </sentence><sentence id="354">And we ran that <span class="building">company</span> for a couple of years and we published some 46 or 48 books. </sentence><sentence id="355">And that was entirely different ball game. </sentence><sentence id="356">It was very interesting because | started doing editing, which | had never done before and | really liked it. </sentence><sentence id="357">But after awhile, you know, we noticed that the book business, the climate had changed, it was very difficult to sell books and particularly the kind of books we liked, you know, literary books, serious books, they weren't selling easily, it was very difficult to <span class="building">market</span> them. </sentence><sentence id="358">So we decided to phase it out. </sentence><sentence id="359">But by then | had become involved in community work. </sentence><sentence id="360">| became associated with the <span class="building">Arena Stage</span>, | don't know if you are familiar with the <span class="building">Arena Stage Theater</span>. </sentence><sentence id="361">| got on the board of the <span class="spatial object">Arena Stage</span> and | was very active there. </sentence><sentence id="362">We, both Jim and | joined Jewish organizations, like American Jewish Committee and we became very active, in fact Jim is now President, just became President of the <span class="populated place">Washington</span> chapter of AJC. </sentence><sentence id="363">And | got on the board of the <span class="building">Capital Children's Museum</span>, | became very friendly with the director there, Ann Lewin(ph) and for awhile | was quite active there, although I'm not active now, even though they still keep my name on the board, | hardly go to meetings any more and | really sort of became very much involved in community affairs of that sort, you know, particularly in the arts. </sentence><sentence id="364">I'm also on the board of the <span class="building">opera</span>, so you know, | go to the <span class="building">opera</span> a lot, | go to the <span class="building">theater</span> a lot and as a consequence of being on those boards, particularly the <span class="building">Arena Stage</span>, we made a lot of friends who are similarly inclined, who love the <span class="building">theater</span>, you know, so there's a whole group of us who love the <span class="building">theater</span> and who play tennis and we play tennis and travel and we travel. </sentence><sentence id="365">We just went with two of the couple to, to <span class="populated place">London</span>. </sentence><sentence id="366">So we, we really have become more involved in the <span class="populated place">community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="367">We still have an <span class="building">office</span> and some of the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection books are still being sold, but | don't need to go in there because my <span class="region">area</span> was more acquiring books, dealing with agents and editing and we are not acquiring new books, so it's just a matter of running the <span class="building">office</span> and make sure that some of the books that are still selling are being reprinted and sold. </sentence><sentence id="370">So my husband goes into the <span class="building">office</span>, but | do not. </sentence><sentence id="371">And we're very much

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="529">Q: What kind of role did Judaism play with them growing up and with you and your family? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="531">A: They went to, well when we lived in <span class="populated place">New York</span> they went to, my daughter went to <span class="building">religious school</span>, my son was too young. </sentence><sentence id="532">She went to <span class="building">religious school</span>, she's a very quick study and she's very bright, so she was learning Hebrew and she was learning all the songs. </sentence><sentence id="533">And she still knows them. </sentence><sentence id="534">Then, when we moved here, we joined a congregation, which was <span class="building">Bethesda Jewish Congregation</span>, which was a very strange congregation and not too successful for us, because the kids hated <span class="building">religious school</span> so much, it was so poorly organized and so poorly done, that they absolutely refused to be bar mitzvahed. </sentence><sentence id="535">And we decided not to force the issue. </sentence><sentence id="536">Now my daughter is, has voluntarily come back to it and I'm hoping that my son will do the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="537">When he was getting married and he married a non-Jew, | said, "Just don't forget where | come from, that's all I'm asking of you." </sentence><sentence id="538">And he said, "Mom, | promise | won't." </sentence><sentence id="539">And | think that's good enough for me, so. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="549">Q: What about you personally and how your ideas changed about Judaism, after? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="551">A: Yes, yeah, well | must say, | was a very reluctant Jew, if you go back in my history, the way the Jews grabbed me away from <span class="country">Poland</span>, | was a very reluctant Jew, but | have slowly come back to it. </sentence><sentence id="552">I've never denied it, but | never practiced it.| think I'm somewhat more Jewish oriented now, | realize that we are a small minority who has accomplished enormous things in spite of all the difficulties. </sentence><sentence id="553">| think the climate is changing also and that Jews are going to be more, treated with more respect, at least | hope. </sentence><sentence id="554">We are very much identified with Jewish causes in the <span class="populated place">city</span> and we do belong to a <span class="building">temple</span>, where we feel that, we don't, we go there because Laura wants to be more practicing and we go for the holidays and we take the children there, you know, for Sukote(ph) and and things like that. </sentence><sentence id="555">So | think, plus the fact, oh there was something else happened. </sentence><sentence id="556">| went, a friend asked me to go to bible class with them, given by a woman in her <span class="building">home</span>, Naomi Rosenblatt, about whom you might have read about because she just came out with a book, Wrestling with Angels? </sentence><sentence id="557">Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="558">Well | took some bible classes and | This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="559">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="560"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection think that sort of also helped me along a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="561">It sort of portrays the Jews as a mixed lot, you know, it doesn't try to gloss over the imperfections and | decided that they are people, like everybody else and you have to sort of identify yourself with them. </sentence><sentence id="562">So it has helped me to sort of get back into the fold also, the <span class="building">bible classes</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="576">Q: Okay, | just want to go back for a moment and talk a little bit more about some of the difficulties in making the transition to the <span class="country">States</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="578">A: Well the first difficulty | had to grapple with was language, when | came to the <span class="country">United States</span>, you know, how to learn the language quickly, because even when you speak a language, for instance, you don't think of stupid little things like, we would go out in a group together and they would say, tell jokes and | wouldn't understand the joke, okay?
