to happen's going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="1839">But it's our <span class="region">land</span>, it's our place, it's our <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1840">And the biggest mistake what I did in my life is when I came here to this <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1841">Maybe God punished me for this. </sentence><sentence id="1842">What I went through here, a lot of trouble. </sentence><sentence id="1843">And there maybe I would avoid everything and wouldn't come to me so much trouble as it came here. </sentence><sentence id="1844">I left because I wasn't afraid that it was a hard time. </sentence><sentence id="1845">My husband went to work, and he work, he could work. </sentence><sentence
