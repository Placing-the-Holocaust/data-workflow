in our lives, we get through this too. </sentence><sentence id="2115">But the only thing, that we are free, we are with Jews, I'm not afraid that they're  3 going to kill me, that I'm a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="2116">Everybody's there, the Jews, but the Arabs, nobody was afraid for the Arabs there, that time. </sentence><sentence id="2117">Even now, they're not afraid for them. </sentence><sentence id="2118">Whatever's going to happen's going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="2119">But it's our <span class="region">land</span>, it's our place, it's our <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2120">And the biggest mistake what I did in my life is when I came here to this <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2121">Maybe God punished me for this. </sentence><sentence id="2122">What I went through here, a lot of trouble. </sentence><sentence id="2123">And there maybe I would avoid everything and wouldn't come to me so much trouble as it came here. </sentence><sentence id="2124">I left because I wasn't afraid that it was a hard time. </sentence><sentence id="2125">My husband went to work, and
