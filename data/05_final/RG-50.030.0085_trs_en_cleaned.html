" </sentence><sentence id="64">Hear oh <span class="country">Israel</span>, the Lord our God, the Lord....". </sentence><sentence id="65">As I turned to Shma Israel, the kids looked up. </sentence><sentence id="66">Hey, these are Jews. </sentence><sentence id="67">The soldiers looked down and saw the kids singing Shma Israel, so with Shma Israel, "Hear oh God the Lord our God, the Lord is one," the whole <span class="interior space">room</span> became one and the soldiers start pointing to the men and the soldiers melted into the crowd and suddenly I saw kids on soldiers! </sentence><sentence id="68">laps. </sentence><sentence id="69">The whole thing became one magnificent beautiful service of victory. </sentence><sentence id="70">And when it was over I turned to to to the, who are you?. </sentence><sentence id="71">So they invited me to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="72">So I have a picture here of me the next week. </sentence><sentence id="73">I'm in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="74">And from the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> I found out that these children attend <span class="building">schools</span>. </sentence><sentence id="75">So then I went, after conducting a sabbath service, which was very unusual - they would never have taken a non- orthodox rabbi to conduct - they didn't even know. </sentence><sentence id="76">They just know I was a chaplain so they didn't bother uh you know - today's world you wouldn't have an orthodox, a conservative rabbi conducting uh an orthodox uh sabbath morning service. </sentence><sentence id="77">This is what I did and they were so pleased and that Bar Mitzvah boy was so wonderful, and and the family ... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="117">Q: Back-up. </sentence><sentence id="118">What Bar Mitzvah boy? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="121">A: A kid from the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="122">A youngster who was turning thirteen and it it was just a delight because a Saturday morning what does he have to do for bar mitzvah - not the speech. </sentence><sentence id="123">He gives a portion of the Talmud - he gives a portion where he asks an impossible question, and I myself said to myself, what is the answer to that question. </sentence><sentence id="124">Then he answers it on the spot. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="125">And while he's answering, he's thinking. </sentence><sentence id="126">He's going na-na-na, and then he gets stuck because he's a little stuck in his own thought. </sentence><sentence id="127">As he gets stuck, the whole congregation sings ya-ba- bam, ya-ba-bam, ya-ba-bam. </sentence><sentence id="128">Then he raises his hand. </sentence><sentence id="129">He's got it. </sentence><sentence id="130">They stop on a dime. </sentence><sentence id="131">He continues na-da-da. </sentence><sentence id="132">Whenever he gets stuck they sing and then they, he carried through with this dissertation of one hour on an impossible subject with an impossible question at the age of thirteen. </sentence><sentence id="133">I was visibly impressed that this is the way they celebrate a Bar Mitzvah. </sentence><sentence id="134">And then I went to the <span class="building">schools</span> the next day. </sentence><sentence id="135">They invited me to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="136">And I went to the juniors and seniors in <span class="building">high school</span> because they already had learned English. </sentence><sentence id="137">They were studying English. </sentence><sentence id="138">And I decided to have them write a composition and the composition is "<span class="building">Home</span> Is Where Your Heart Is.". </sentence><sentence id="139">I said where is your <span class="building">home</span>?. </sentence><sentence id="140">Where is your heart now that you've come from all over the world?. </sentence><sentence id="141">And how thrilling it was to have youngsters who had never heard of <span class="country">Israel</span> but now they say we don't want to go back any place, any place. </sentence><sentence id="142">We want to go place to a <span class="region">land</span> that we can call our own and the only <span class="region">land</span> in the world that we would trust today would be <span class="country">Israel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="143">So the 90%, then 10% of course said they'd like to go to <span class="country">America</span>, so they were there. </sentence><sentence id="144">But I have used some of their original, their letters to quote from them to show of this universal love that they had to go to a homeland, to <span class="country">Israel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="145">Now here we are in <span class="country">China</span>, and I don't know how - what you want to continue in here, but I have... </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="146">Q: Let let me let ask you if I could a couple of questions. </sentence><sentence id="147">Can you describe for me uh the <span class="populated place">Jewish ghetto</span> in <span class="populated place">Shanghai</span> as you found it?. </sentence><sentence id="148">You have given me two incidents but after the service and after the bar mitzvah, uh you learned about the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="149">Tell me what you learned?. </sentence><sentence id="150">What what how was it structured?. </sentence><sentence id="151">What had people done?. </sentence><sentence id="152">That sort of thing. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="153">A: Well, the Jewish community of <span class="populated place">Shanghai</span> which I came into and this was already uh this was right after the war, the Joint Distribution Committee and uh of of the Jewish people heard about their <span class="populated place">Shanghai ghetto</span>...well first of all, how did we become a <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>?. </sentence><sentence id="154">How did it become a <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>?. </sentence><sentence id="155">The Japanese became very friendly with Nazis, and they didn't want to be outdone when they heard what Hitler was doing to the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="156">The Jews were living very peacefully in <span class="country">China</span> and in <span class="populated place">Shanghai</span>. </sentence><sentence id="157">But as they came and conquered <span class="populated place">Shanghai</span> they decided that they must follow and imitate uh the <span class="country">Nazi empire</span>. </sentence><sentence id="158">Otherwise they wouldn't be uh good allies, so they immediately started to introduce some of the customs that were prevalent in <span class="country">Nazi Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="159">They immediately said, here, you Jews have to be within the scope of this.__...(PH) settlement so to speak. </sentence><sentence id="160">This is where you have to be. </sentence><sentence id="161">You have certain hours you can't go out. </sentence><sentence id="162">This is where you will be. </sentence><sentence id="163">Your <span class="building">schools</span> will be here, and they made a complete and they actually had uh I I don't know, I remember some of the kids saying they had badges which after the war they ripped off, and had all kinds of symbols to remind them that they are Jews, that they are Jews. </sentence><sentence id="164">That they are different from all other people and this was the stigmata that that the Japanese carried over merely to ape uh Hitler's concept of what should be, this image of the Jew to the world. </sentence><sentence id="165">And this is what they tried to imitate in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="166">But the the <span class="building">Joint Distribution Committee</span> came in immediately with food and with equipment and I was amongst the first that was standing there and I have a picture with me with little children where we're giving them food baskets and and trying to show them that there are other people out there who care for them, who want to help them. </sentence><sentence id="167">And this is where I met them. </sentence><sentence id="168">And then I have stories of their schooling, and ... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="186">Q: Tell me some of those that as you know them, as your experiences were in the <span class="building">schools</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="188">A: Well, they had two types of schooling. </sentence><sentence id="189">There was a man there by the name of <span class="building">Saul Livery</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="190">Does the name ring a bell?. </sentence><sentence id="191"><span class="building">Saul Livery</span> was in the <span class="populated place">Shanghai ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="192">He was the spirit of Judaism in the <span class="populated place">Shanghai ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="193">He decided that even though we're in these dismal surroundings, there's one thing that we need to know. </sentence><sentence id="194">We have to know our heritage. </sentence><sentence id="195">We have to know our history. </sentence><sentence id="196">We have to know our literature. </sentence><sentence id="197">And so <span class="building">Saul Livery</span> was the spirit that motivated and energized not just the <span class="building">Yeshiva</span> learning, but that the Jews should know literature and history even on a Hebraic (ph) secular level. </sentence><sentence id="198">Hebrew literature, see. </sentence><sentence id="199">He wanted to teach them Hebrew so he formed a series of religious schooling which was the saving grace of these young people. </sentence><sentence id="200">Then they had to have their secular schooling so there were there were two great <span class="building">schools</span> - one was the <span class="building">Kaduri (ph) School</span> and the other was another <span class="building">high school</span> which I, slips my mind but I have it in my notes, and in these <span class="building">schools</span> the children went to <span class="building">high school</span> to learn their secular subjects. </sentence><sentence id="201">When I came in to the little <span class="building">Jewish schools</span>, I found out that they had nothing to write on. </sentence><sentence id="202">The kids would pick up a piece of paper from the trash and pick up a piece of paper from the trash and pick up a piece of  black slate that writes and these were their notebooks. </sentence><sentence id="203">And I saw that. </sentence><sentence id="204">I thought I must do something about it. </sentence><sentence id="205">So I sent back <span class="building">home</span> and they sent me books and and paper and notebooks and pencils and so on - the greatest gift. </sentence><sentence id="206">Imagine children considering it the greatest gift I could give them. </sentence><sentence id="207">When I came one day to their to their little <span class="building">schools</span> and I handed out notebooks with pencils, with pens, with books, with with all the equipment that they needed. </sentence><sentence id="208">They said I revolutionized the the <span class="building">school</span> system in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> because we gave them pens and pencils. </sentence><sentence id="209">When I think of what a gift means to somebody - they they they kissed my hands, the kids, for for the fact that I brought them this. </sentence><sentence id="210">The same as after that first service. </sentence><sentence id="211">At at the end of that first service I'm standing at the <span class="dlf">door</span> trying to see who these people are as they leave to say goodbye, and they started kissing my chaplain's insignia which I have there. </sentence><sentence id="212">The Jewish, because I had a Jewish star on it - they say you brought freedom, freedom to us and these, the whole the whole <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> felt that <span class="country">America</span> saved them. </sentence><sentence id="213">That we brought freedom to the people from the <span class="country">Nazi empire</span>. </sentence><sentence id="214">It was a very thrilling moment in in American history when we were considered the proponents of freedom. </sentence><sentence id="215">It's being recapitulated right now in every <span class="country">country</span> of <span class="region">Eastern Europe</span> that that that when you .. OK.Any other questions? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="245">Q: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="246">Tell me some more about other places in the vic...uh in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> that you visited. </sentence><sentence id="247">Tell me about people's <span class="building">homes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="248">What were they like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="253">A: Well, the <span class="building">homes</span> that I visited, and I'll give you an example of this bar mitzvah - I went into a little <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="254">They must have had about five or six in one <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="255">They they they went from hand to <span class="dlf">mouth</span> as far as food is concerned. </sentence><sentence id="256">Uh some standing on <span class="dlf">food lines</span> and some uh trying to eke out a living from each other, just like in in the ancient in the in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> of of of former times, of of three, four hundred years ago. </sentence><sentence id="257">What I found most exciting was the fact that the the Judaism which to many of them had never meant anything, I found that the the Jews of the survivors went one way or another. </sentence><sentence id="258">I thought that most of them would turn against their faith and I thought that as I went in one <span class="building">home</span> after another these were survivors and these were the children and these were children without any parents who they adopted as their own. </sentence><sentence id="259">As I went into these <span class="building">homes</span> I felt why would they want to carry on this heritage where there they were told - by the way some of them are so assimilated, so far-removed from anything Jewish - they looked so German that they could be an example of blonde hair, blue eyes, clipped - an example of German aristocracy, and went into their pitiful <span class="building">homes</span> and saw their lovely children, saw that these children weren't even their children. </sentence><sentence id="260">They were adopting orphans who - by the way that's quite a story that these orphans were brought half way around the world and I found out later, you remember there's a story about Hannah Szenes [NB: Sennesh] who who who said I'm a match that was not to be consumed, where she volunteered to help save - I found out that Haganah, that the Jewish underground, had formed a <span class="dlf">railway</span> and taken youngsters and put them into <span class="building">Christian homes</span> who put their lives on the stake to save Jewish kids where the kids would be hidden in these <span class="building">Christian homes</span> by day, and in the evening, at sunset they would pick them up and ride them through the <span class="env feature">mountains</span> and ride them to the next <span class="populated place">town</span> where they had another <span class="building">Christian home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="261">I didn't know that story. </sentence><sentence id="262">And here I find that these kids were telling about the Israelis who who from  from <span class="building">Haganah</span>, went out there to save these kids. </sentence><sentence id="263">This was a chapter that that that really was hair-raising to me, to find these kids saved from in that kind of situation. </sentence><sentence id="264">As far as the - let me give you this bar mitzvah. </sentence><sentence id="265">Here's a lovely little kid, little boy who would have known nothing if it weren't for the fact that a fellow like <span class="building">Saul Livery</span> so to it that there was Jewish education. </sentence><sentence id="266">And took the few that knew Jewish education and made <span class="building">schools</span> around them. </sentence><sentence id="267">By the way, not only <span class="building">schools</span> - they created a choir, a choir of forty voices that came and sang at my first service. </sentence><sentence id="268">They had uh men with such beautiful voices - they called them cantors. </sentence><sentence id="269">They had operatic voices. </sentence><sentence id="270">I had an operatic singer conducting my Friday night service. </sentence><sentence id="271">With such a voice I wish I had video and I wish I had sound recording to hear that voice. </sentence><sentence id="272">To me it was, an operatic tenor like like Jan Peerce or Richard Tucker the days of...so here was my service where these people walked in and and and they - forty voice choir. </sentence><sentence id="273">An operatic singer to help me conduct a service, so at the beginning it was very cold because they did their Germanic music and I didn't get in to it. </sentence><sentence id="274">It wasn't until they let me take over with an opening hymn "Shma Israel" that the whole group got together. </sentence><sentence id="275">That that's an aside. </sentence><sentence id="276">But the beauty of that experience is that I see this youngster who could easily - first of all, how he survived - he was an orphan - how he survived the Nazi massacre and ended up in <span class="populated place">Shanghai</span> in itself is is beyond understanding. </sentence><sentence id="277">Since he was only thirteen he wasn't one of those that wrote my compositions, so I started to talk with him and its another one of those stories. </sentence><sentence id="278">He he saw his - the knock on the <span class="dlf">door</span> - he he saw them take his father and his mother and his sister and he were left and then and then two days later his sister was taken because she was a beautiful girl, and this kid saw it at four, five, six years old and he's telling this story and now he's going to be bar mitzvahed in <span class="populated place">Shanghai</span>, all alone. </sentence><sentence id="279">His mother disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="280">So this is the kind of story that I got in in in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and and when you get it directly, when you hear it from a kid's lips, it's different than than the whole six million story again and again. </sentence><sentence id="281">It's just different. </sentence><sentence id="282">A bar mitzvah. </sentence><sentence id="283">This kid to have such a Jewish bar mitzvah. </sentence><sentence id="284">When they had to celebrate after the service, I, they said come and join us in a drink. </sentence><sentence id="285">They had one bottle of schnapps, of liquor, which they had kept for the whole year and every time they take a few they fill it with water. </sentence><sentence id="286">They filled the <span class="spatial object">bottle</span> with water so it says liquor. </sentence><sentence id="287">I said I don't drink. </sentence><sentence id="288">They says this you can drink. </sentence><sentence id="289">I said I don't drink. </sentence><sentence id="290">They said this you can drink. </sentence><sentence id="291">Take a look. </sentence><sentence id="292">I'm drinking water. </sentence><sentence id="293">But they have a big bottle of Jewish liquor, uh liquor, and they, everybody drinks it as if LALHAIM (ph) and they make believe they're they're getting drunk on it. </sentence><sentence id="294">It's the same. </sentence><sentence id="295">They have five bottles like that, practically all water, but this was their their schnapps. </sentence><sentence id="296">This was their SABBATH THING and a little old piece of herring which was this big - I didn't want to take anything because here I come from where we have everything in the service. </sentence><sentence id="297">They insisted. </sentence><sentence id="298">From their nothingness they insisted that I have something. </sentence><sentence id="299">So I have a picture of one of these bigger <span class="building">homes</span>, a big <span class="interior space">basement</span> where we were meeting sabbath morning, after the service. </sentence><sentence id="300">So there's a a little bit of the flavor of what I'm talking about in in in in <span class="populated place">Shanghai</span>. </sentence><sentence id="301">Now I can, I don't know - based on your timing experience I would uh I could uh I could tell you the end of that story. </sentence><sentence id="302">Alright. </sentence><sentence id="303">The end of the story is that I started badgering the <span class="building">Pentagon</span> that I want these kids out. </sentence><sentence id="304">I want a <span class="spatial object">ship</span>. </sentence><sentence id="305">I want somebody to come. </sentence><sentence id="306">It's after the war now. </sentence><sentence id="307">By the way, we couldn't get out after the war because there were no, there was no <span class="spatial object">transportation</span>. </sentence><sentence id="308">They felt that the, that the people from <span class="country">Europe</span> were more entitled to get back than we who came in a little later. </sentence><sentence id="309">So all the <span class="spatial object">boats</span> and all means of  transportation, they gave us no idea of when we would get out of of <span class="populated place">Shanghai</span>. </sentence><sentence id="310">Uh my luck was that my wife was pregnant with a child, and at the end of that period uh the doctor said look, something has gone wrong, and it's only because of her uncertainty of where you are -
