id="246">Romantic stuff that - </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="247">Q: What -- what language did you speak at <span class="building">home</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="248">A: Oh, at -- at <span class="building">home</span> we spoke Alsatian, which is a dialect, based on German and my mother spoke French, obviously I spoke French and went to <span class="building">French school</span> and in my teenage, rebellious years, I pretended I couldn't understand anything but French, which my father didn't speak. </sentence><sentence id="249">Don't forget, that <span class="region">Alsace</span> moved back and forth between <span class="country">France</span> and <span class="country">Germany</span>, which meant that my grandmother, who lived with us, was born in the French period, to -- became German in 1871, when <span class="country">France</span> lost the

</sentence><sentence id="253">Now, my mother came from a very Francophile, somewhat more educated family and all the daughters were sent to <span class="populated place">Paris</span>, at least for some time, to be with an aunt, whom I know -- whom I knew too, and there they perfected their French. </sentence><sentence id="254">So my mother spoke and wrote perfect French. </sentence><sentence

<span class="populated place">rural community</span>, never bothered to learn French. </sentence><sentence id="260">So he could understand somewhat. </sentence><sentence id="261">So as I said, in my rebellious teenage years, when he and I collided, I couldn't understand <span class="populated place">Alsatian</span>. </sentence><sentence id="262">I should like to add something that -- very pa -- I don't know how interesting it is to this particular interview, but Alsatian Jews speak not -- sp-speak what is called in French, le Judeo Alsatian, or in their own parlance, they call it Yiddish dige. </sentence><sentence id="263">It's not Yiddish, because God forbid an Alsatian Jew should speak Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="264">The Alsatian Jews look down on eastern European Jews, whom they all called Polacks, that's -- was the n-nomination, so just like the German Jews in this <span class="country">country</span> look down on the immigrants that came after them from the <span class="region">eastern European countries</span>. </sentence><sentence id="265">Exactly the same situation. </sentence><sentence id="266">My father is probably turning around in his <span class="dlf">grave</span>, as I have discovered that this Judeo Alsatian, which they spoke, is really similar to Yiddish. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="267">It's not -- does not have -- it's -- doesn't have a written language, it doesn't have a literature. </sentence><sentence id="268">It was just a spoken language -- is dying out, but it's being retrieved and I happen -- I -- where as when I grew up, I thought of it as very crude and very common and I walked two miles behind my parents when they spoke it. </sentence><sentence id="269">Today, I'm very interested in it and I have read a number of books. </sentence><sentence id="270">There -- I find out there is -- I have been communicating with people who are studying it and there is very few of us who still ha-have a feel for it. </sentence><sentence id="271">It's a very rich language, very different from Yiddish This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="272">It is not the primary source, and it

id="275">So, this is how that beca -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="276">Q: Can -- can you give us a short example of how it sounds? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="277">A: Yes, I can give you one that I always use when people ask me. </sentence><sentence id="278">In <span class="country">Germany</span> you say, "<span class="dlf">Eashe harbor</span> gie gessen." </sentence><sentence id="279">I have eaten. </sentence><sentence id="280">In Yiddish, you say, "Ay chobe gessen." </sentence><sentence id="281">In <span class="populated place">Alsatian</span>, you say, "<span class="building">Shop gessa</span>." </sentence><sentence id="282">In Yiddish dige, le Judeo Alsatian, "Ishap ger archult." </sentence><sentence id="283">I don't if you know Hebrew, but ochell in Hebrew is to eat. </sentence><sentence id="284">So they -- they use the Hebrew word, they conjugate it in <span class="populated place">germaway</span> and they say, Ishap. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="285">The big difference, eehope and ishap, that's the big different. </sentence><sentence id="286">Ishap ger archult and that's the way my father would speak, using Hebrew words, conjugating them and distorting them, so that in order to trace back what it really means, you really have to do a little research. </sentence><sentence id="287">And it's -- has intrigued enough people. </sentence><sentence id="288">There is a <span class="spatial object">chair</span> of Judeo Alsatian [indecipherable] at the <span class="building">university</span> now. </sentence><sentence id="289">And it's a non-Jewish person who is studying it. </sentence><sentence id="290">So it's interesting [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="291">But anyway, this is what we spoke at <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="292">And coming back to this, the <span class="env feature">atmosphere</span>, you know, my parents had no social life. </sentence><sentence id="293">They didn't go out, they didn't travel. </sentence><sentence id="294">My vacations
