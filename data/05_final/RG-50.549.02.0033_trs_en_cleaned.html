was happening at that time. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="28">A: Well, we were liberated in, I think the third of December, of 1944, by the Scottish army and they were followed by I guess British and the Americans. </sentence><sentence id="29">But I don't know much about that any more. </sentence><sentence id="30">The -- Couple of months before that, we suffered immensely under real war conditions. </sentence><sentence id="31">In September they started dropping the troops in <span class="populated place">Arnum</span>, and since I lived in <span class="populated place">Fenlow</span> at that time, which isn't so far, we saw, actually it -- all the troops coming over in big <span class="spatial object">airplanes</span>, and it was on a Sunday, it was brilliant, sunny day, and I'll never forget it, because it was just immense. </sentence><sentence id="32">It -- It was never ending, big <span class="spatial object">airplanes</span> and little <span class="spatial object">airplanes</span>, which we later on found out were <span class="spatial object">gliders</span>, and that's really when our liberation sort of started, from that moment on, we were practically constantly under fire. </sentence><sentence id="33">And we -- we couldn't go outside any more and we didn't have gas and electricity and things like that. </sentence><sentence id="34">And life became very, very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="35">I was still in hiding of course, and a few very dangerous things happened to my personally. </sentence><sentence id="36">We had no food so my stepmother and her daughter went out to get food in the <span class="dlf">field</span>, like cauliflowers an-and potatoes and things like that, cause the farmers couldn't get it, because the man didn't go outside, they -- the Germans were very much aware of the man and they wanted them to go to help them in <span class="country">Germany</span>, I guess. </sentence><sentence id="37">So, and then, it was a couple of -- maybe -- it was in October, maybe then already, that some Germans came to the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="38">I was there with my stepfather, who was in <span class="spatial object">bed</span>, because he was on strike. </sentence><sentence id="39">The Dutch government had told all the people who worked for the <span class="dlf">railroad</span> that they had to go on strike, so he did. </sentence><sentence id="40">And there This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="41">It is not the

collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0033 4 was a son in the <span class="building">house</span>, who was supposed to be working for the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="43">So, he was also somewhere hiding in the <span class="building">house</span>, so I had to open the <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="44">And the Germans said they wanted to look in the <span class="building">house</span>, and they looked in the <span class="building">house</span>, and they decided the <span class="building">house</span> was good. </sentence><sentence id="45">And they told me they were going to come back in the evening to live in our <span class="building">house</span> for awhile. </sentence><sentence id="46">So, for about two weeks, I think, they lived with us. </sentence><sentence id="47">And they sometimes asked for me, but I was every night very, very tired, so when they came in, my stepmother told them that well, I was so tired, I wasn't used to doing the housework and all that sort of stuff, so I always went to <span class="spatial object">bed</span> early. </sentence><sentence id="48">So they never saw me. </sentence><sentence id="49"><span class="interior space">Course</span>, they were scared that if they found out I was Jewish, that the whole family would be killed. </sentence><sentence id="50">So, when the war came closer and closer, the Germans left, because they -- they stayed away from the real fighting apparently. </sentence><sentence id="51">And then in December, we were finally liberated, but that was sort of difficult too, because the -- the Germans had recreated all the people who lived in our little <span class="populated place">town</span>, and they had to all go across the <span class="env feature">River Maus</span>, into <span class="country">Germany</span>, and then up <span class="region">north</span>, into the <span class="region">northern part</span> of <span class="country">Holland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="52">And they wanted all the regular people out of <span class="populated place">town</span>, and they wanted to go -- go [indecipherable] us for the Americans and the British who were coming. </sentence><sentence id="53">So, my stepparents decided that I, who had no papers at all, was too much of a danger to take along on that kind of a trip, and so we all went into hiding. </sentence><sentence id="54">The man stayed somewhere, I don't know where, but we, the women, stayed in a bombed-out <span class="building">house</span>, and there we stayed for a couple of days. </sentence><sentence id="55">There was some food, there was <span class="env feature">water</span> and that's where we were liberated. </sentence><sentence id="56">And it was, of course, still very, very dangerous, because the troops didn't cross the <span class="env feature">river</span>, and it was constant bombarding and This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence

decided that they didn't want us there, so we were evacuated to another <span class="populated place">town</span>, and there we stayed til I think the middle of April. </sentence><sentence id="60">In the meantime, <span class="country">Holland</span> wasn't even liberated altogether, so while I was in the other <span class="populated place">town</span> with my step-parents, and the son and the daughter, we were free. </sentence><sentence id="61">My step-parents kept on asking me, very unnoticed for me, really, my name and my -- my father's name. </sentence><sentence id="62">And then the next day they ask me my mother's name, and so they came -- in a couple of weeks they came to know who I really was, cause you never talked about it and you never wrote that down. </sentence><sentence id="63">And they apparently gave that to a Jewish organization who was trying to find all the children. </sentence><sentence id="64">And then they -- that organization decided that maybe it was a good thing for me to go to <span class="country">Israel</span>, but -- then <span class="country">Palestine</span>, but I didn't want to hear about that, cause I wanted to know if I still somehow, would find my parents back. </sentence><sentence id="65">I had no idea where they were. </sentence><sentence id="66">So, they -- they decided they were going to keep me in the <span class="building">house</span> for -- I don't know how long, maybe they would have taken me forever. </sentence><sentence id="67">And then my father, who was hidden in <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span> first, but later on left for <span class="region">northern Holland</span>, somehow got himself involved in underground work. </sentence><sentence id="68">He was an artist and he was good in doing precise pictures, so he put part of the <span class="region">province</span> where he was in, an-and mapped it for the <span class="interior space">underground</span> and that was sent to <span class="country">England</span>, so that when the troops were coming, that they knew exactly where every <span class="building">house</span> was, and where every little obstacle would be. </sentence><sentence id="69">And then somehow he was caught by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="70">They came in the <span class="building">house</span> to check something. </sentence><sentence id="71">He and the owner of the <span class="building">house</span> were sent to <span class="building">prison</span> because they were listening to the English radio when the Germans walked in. </sentence><sentence id="72">And thank This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="73">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="74"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0033 6 God my father didn't reveal that he was Jewish, and they never found out that he was Jewish, so he spent a couple of months in <span class="building">jail</span>. </sentence><sentence id="75">And had they known he was Jewish, they would, of course, have killed him instantly. </sentence><sentence id="76">But he was liberated there. </sentence><sentence id="77">And as it was, the troops apparently traveled with lists of children who were liberated. </sentence><sentence id="78">So, when my father came out of <span class="building">prison</span>, they somehow presented him with a list. </sentence><sentence id="79">And my maiden name is D" <span class="populated place">Ancona</span>, D'A, and when -- in <span class="country">Holland</span>, it's -- the A counts as the main letter, so my name was on top, and my father found out that I was okay. </sentence><sentence id="80">But then the problem was he was up north and I was down south and there was no transportation in <span class="country">Holland</span>, especially in the part where I was, everything was damaged and bombed, and there were no <span class="dlf">roads</span>, there was no public transportation, no <span class="spatial object">trains</span>, no <span class="spatial object">buses</span>, nothing. </sentence><sentence id="81">So, since my father had worked for the <span class="interior space">underground</span>, he got some letters from important people, I would say, who gave him permission to travel. </sentence><sentence id="82">So he somehow talked himself into being allowed to cross the <span class="env feature">rivers</span>, and you know, on a <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> without tires. </sentence><sentence id="83">And he came one day to -- to the <span class="building">house</span> where I was hidden, and I then lived in freedom. </sentence><sentence id="84">And well, he knocked on the <span class="dlf">door</span>, and we didn't get many visitors there, and so when I heard a man speak, I knew right away it was my dad. </sentence><sentence id="85">And at that time I found out that my mother was caught by the Germans and that she had gone away, that she was in the <span class="populated place">holding camp</span>, <span class="populated place">Westerbork</span>, and after that was sent to wherever, and that we had no way of knowing if my mother had survived. </sentence></p></dialogue>
