" </sentence><sentence id="3200">I noticed the arm," she said. </sentence><sentence id="3201">And, and when I turned around after she called, "Carola," it was my sister. </sentence><sentence id="3202">And we hugged  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 3 and I wanted to know what happened to my parents, and she said they were all dead. </sentence><sentence id="3203">And that's where <span class="populated place">Grese</span> was, <span class="populated place">Grese</span>, "the Beast of <span class="populated place">Bergen-Belsen</span>." </sentence><sentence id="3204">She witnessed this thing, she seen me speaking to my sister and hugging my sister. </sentence><sentence id="3205">And she stood there and cried. </sentence><sentence id="3206">Something nobody had ever seen before, and then she said to me, "Carola," she heard my sister call "Carola"; otherwise, she wouldn't have known. </sentence><sentence id="3207">She said, "You don't have to worry. </sentence><sentence id="3208">Your sister is going to stay with you now." </sentence><sentence id="3209">And we hugged again, at least we are together. </sentence><sentence id="3210">And whatever happens, we are together. </sentence><sentence id="3211">And she said, "Okay, there is nothing to worry about. </sentence><sentence id="3212">Your sister is going to be with you." </sentence><sentence id="3213">So I was trying to hold on to my sister, but she had to go through all kinds of different routines. </sentence><sentence id="3214">Having, being tattooed. </sentence><sentence id="3215">She was tattooed on the inside because I felt that she didn't have to have -- in case she would survive, she has a tiny little tattoo. </sentence><sentence id="3216">And I thought we would be together, but it was just a false promise. </sentence><sentence id="3217">They sent her to a different <span class="populated place">camp</span>, and I didn't know where she went. </sentence><sentence id="3218">And once in a while, one of my friends who went around -- my friend, Claire,, one of the Frankfurt girls, she would go to the <span class="populated place">camp</span> where she was in. </sentence><sentence id="3219">And she would come back, and she says, "Your sister is still alive. </sentence><sentence id="3220">Your sister is still alive." </sentence><sentence id="3221">She was in a different <span class="populated place">camp</span>, and, I would hear from her once in a while. " </sentence><sentence id="3222">Not to worry, I'm still living." </sentence><sentence id="3223">And I had hoped that maybe, you know, maybe the Russians would come and we would, we would be free again, and we would get together. </sentence><sentence id="3224">But there was little hope, very little hope that we would be together. </sentence><sentence id="3225">So it went on,, the march that was in 1944 in, in August. </sentence><sentence id="3226">1945 in January, the big march from <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> started, and I didn't know where my sister was. </sentence><sentence id="3227">I didn't know what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="3228">She was already so tiny and so skinny, I was afraid that she, she would be killed. </sentence><sentence id="3229">She would have been killed already then. </sentence><sentence id="3230">So we marched out of <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> day and night, and late night and day. </sentence><sentence id="3231">And we were in <span class="spatial object">cattle cars</span> and we went to <span class="populated place">Ravensbriick</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3232">And in <span class="populated place">Ravensbriick</span> we stayed four weeks, and I had no -- no sight of my sister. </sentence><sentence id="3233">I didn't know where she was. </sentence><sentence id="3234">We marched out of <span class="populated place">Ravensbriick</span>, and from <span class="populated place">Ravensbriick</span> we went supposedly to <span class="populated place">Malchow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3235">We did go to <span class="populated place">Malchow</span>, there was another march from <span class="populated place">Ravensbriick</span> to <span class="populated place">Malchow</span> day and night, day and night. </sentence><sentence id="3236">And I was already so weak, and we all were. </sentence><sentence id="3237">One helped me on one side, the other on the other <span class="region">side</span>, and we slept walking. </sentence><sentence id="3238">And that's how we went on, and whoever didn't do it lay down and they shot them. </sentence><sentence id="3239">They didn't give them any chance; they shot the girls just right then and there. </sentence><sentence id="3240">So at one point I had to go to the <span class="interior space">bathroom</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3241">I didn't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="3242">And I went out of my <span class="dlf">line</span> and there was no <span class="interior space">bathroom</span>, but there was <span class="building">barn</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3243">So I went into the <span class="building">barn</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3244">I said to the girls, "I have to go to the <span class="interior space">bathroom</span>, it's impossible." </sentence><sentence id="3245">I went to the <span class="building">barn</span>, I walked into <span class="building">barn</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3246">My sister walked out of the <span class="building">barn</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3247">And so I said, "Now, you're not going to be out of my sight anymore. </sentence><sentence id="3248">You're going to be with me." </sentence><sentence id="3249">And we did cling to each and she walked with me. </sentence><sentence id="3250">And everybody thought she was my little sister because she's small. </sentence><sentence id="3251">And we stayed together from that day on "til we were in <span class="populated place">Malchow</span>, we stayed together. </sentence><sentence id="3252">We were never separated anymore. </sentence><sentence id="3253">So that was one good thing that I had to the <span class="interior space">bathroom</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3254">That was a very unusual incident. </sentence><sentence id="3255">So from the march on, we marched into <span class="populated place">Malchow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3256">That was the <span class="populated place">camp</span> where we hardly got any salt in anything. </sentence><sentence id="3257">But I had a chance to work in their <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>, and in the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> what I did there is I did heat the <span

</sentence><sentence id="3260">So what we really -- what the girls cooked there was water, potato peels, and a little bit of <span class="env feature">farina</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3261">Not <span class="region">farina</span>, oatmeal. </sentence><sentence id="3262">And that made sort of a soup, but it was better than nothing. </sentence><sentence id="3263">So at least I had a little soup I could give my sister and my friends, Claire, who was with me and Martha. </sentence><sentence id="3264">Two of the girls from <span class="populated place">Frankfurt</span> survived with me. </sentence><sentence id="3265">We were together, and I had a chance to give them a little extra soup. </sentence><sentence id="3266">I added a little hot water and it was good. </sentence><sentence id="3267">But we got thinner and thinner every day because they took away the salt. </sentence><sentence id="3268">But that's where we laid around, and that's where we talked to the Gypsies and we talked about food and talked about better times which we felt we will never see. </sentence><sentence id="3269">And across from us was a <span class="populated place">camp</span> with English prisoners, and they looked just as bad as we did. </sentence><sentence id="3270">It was just across from the <span class="populated place">camp</span> we were in. </sentence><sentence id="3271">They were also laying around, like, you know, like, like dead animals. </sentence><sentence id="3272">You know, when you go to a <span class="building">zoo</span> and sometimes and those animals look like tranquilized, that's what we all looked like. </sentence><sentence id="3273">We were just either waiting to die or being liberated. </sentence><sentence id="3274">Something had to happen to us, we couldn't go on anymore. </sentence><sentence id="3275">And then that was in February, and we talked about that maybe we're getting liberated. </sentence><sentence id="3276">Maybe the Russians were coming closer, but we had no newspaper. </sentence><sentence id="3277">Nobody knew anything. </sentence><sentence id="3278">All of a sudden at the beginning of May, the Nazis, the SS came running in and they kept screaming, "Get out of here you dirty Jews. </sentence><sentence id="3279">Get out of here. </sentence><sentence id="3280">Let's go. </sentence><sentence id="3281">Walk." </sentence><sentence id="3282">Now, we figured "where are we walking now?" </sentence><sentence id="3283">We could hardly move anymore. </sentence><sentence id="3284">They walked us into the <span class="env feature">woods</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3285">We were so sure that in the <span class="env feature">woods</span> they were going to shoot us. </sentence><sentence id="3286">Because it was coming closer, the war was getting -- coming to an end, we felt. </sentence><sentence id="3287">And why in the <span class="env feature">woods</span>? </sentence><sentence id="3288">So they marched us into the <span class="env feature">woods</span>, and all of a sudden in the <span class="env feature">woods</span> -- it was, I think it was May the 3rd, or was it -- maybe it was a different -- maybe May the 8th. </sentence><sentence id="3289">I think it was May the 3rd. </sentence><sentence id="3290">They all disappeared, there were no Nazi uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="3291">They were either they had their private uniform, their clothes in a package. </sentence><sentence id="3292">The SS men disappeared; there were none. </sentence><sentence id="3293">And all of a sudden we see a <span class="spatial object">tank</span> with three young American soldiers screaming from the top of their lungs, "You guys are free. </sentence><sentence id="3294">Hitler is dead. </sentence><sentence id="3295">You're free, you're free." </sentence><sentence id="3296">And they had -- I remember they had chocolate. </sentence><sentence id="3297">There was a quite a few of us. </sentence><sentence id="3298">They had chocolate and cigarettes, and they threw it out of the <span class="spatial object">tank</span>, and they threw it down for us. </sentence><sentence id="3299">It wasn't enough for all of us, and we -- my sister looked at me and said, "Did you hear that? </sentence><sentence id="3300">We're free." </sentence><sentence id="3301">I said, "Yes, but where are we going to be?" </sentence><sentence id="3302">We were free, we were happy, but no place to go. </sentence><sentence id="3303">But, we had more than other people because we had each other. </sentence><sentence id="3304">So while we were sitting around in the <span class="env feature">woods</span>, we all got together and, "We got to do something. </sentence><sentence id="3305">Where are we going? </sentence><sentence id="3306">We're not going to go back to <span class="country">Germany</span>." </sentence><sentence id="3307">So one of the girls, Slovak girls, said, "I lost two
