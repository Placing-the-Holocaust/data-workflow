<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="143">Q: Tell us then, uh, what happened to this family when the Germans came? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="145">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="146">When the Germans came in, my father...1 mean actually we were...we had no food in the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="147">It was not like here. </sentence><sentence id="148">You had always something in the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="149">In <span class="country">Europe</span>, everything you need, you used to go out every day in the <span class="building">store</span>, and you used to buy. </sentence><sentence id="150">When the war broke out, the <span class="env feature">water</span> was cut off. </sentence><sentence id="151">There was no gas in the <span class="building">house</span> to cook anything. </sentence><sentence id="152">There was no food. </sentence><sentence id="153">So my father used to go out once in a while and we used to get some bread or the necessary things. </sentence><sentence id="154">And I remember for a couple of weeks, we lived just on sour pickles because not far where we used to live, a couple of <span class="dlf">streets</span>, there was a <span class="building">factory</span>, they used to produce pickles. </sentence><sentence id="155">A <span class="building">Polish factory</span>! </sentence><sentence id="156">And they call it Original, and they used to have the pickles in <span class="building">tents</span> like...small <span class="building">tents</span>, and large ones. </sentence><sentence id="157">As I found out, so I went with a friend of mine and somehow we got in to that <span class="building">building</span> in the night, even when the bombs were falling and we used to run in the middle of the night and we grabbed about 6 or 8 cans, about 5 pounds and we dragged it <span class="building">home</span>, and this we lived for a couple of weeks. </sentence><sentence id="158">Just on pickles!And once in a while, we got bread. </sentence><sentence id="159">But we had some rice. </sentence><sentence id="160">So we had rice and pickles. </sentence><sentence id="161">And this went on for...for weeks. </sentence><sentence id="162">There were <span class="building">houses</span> burning. </sentence><sentence id="163">I mean it was...to describe a regular This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="164">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="165"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection hell, because there was no <span class="env feature">water</span> to douche the fires out, so the only thing they did was let the fires go. </sentence><sentence id="166">It just happened the <span class="building">house</span> we lived that nothing happened. </sentence><sentence id="167">Like next <span class="building">house</span>, third <span class="building">house</span>, in the night when it stopped, people used to go out from the <span class="building">houses</span> and look for something to eat. </sentence><sentence id="168">And this kept on for 4 weeks. </sentence><sentence id="169">When the Germans came in, so they didn't know what's going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="170">New rules. </sentence><sentence id="171">New Regime. </sentence><sentence id="172">They first thing they did, they made a curfew. </sentence><sentence id="173">You are not allowed to walk the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="174">But still there was no food. </sentence><sentence id="175">So the only thing they did was on the <span class="dlf">corner</span> someplace like it happens someplaces, they used to have <span class="interior space">field kitchens</span>, and they used to give to the people bread and salamis. </sentence><sentence id="176">This is the truth. </sentence><sentence id="177">Right when they walked in. </sentence><sentence id="178">I found this it out through a friend of mine. </sentence><sentence id="179">When you go over there, let's say maybe 3 miles, 4 miles, there is a <span class="interior space">field kitchen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="180">You gonna go over there, you gonna get something. </sentence><sentence id="181">I remember like now I took my older sister. </sentence><sentence id="182">We walked and we walked and...and still the fires were on both sides, but the war was ended already. </sentence><sentence id="183">They occupied the <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="184">We came over there. </sentence><sentence id="185">We saw a <span class="dlf">line</span> of people, and we stood in the <span class="dlf">line</span> for that bread and the salami and sometime they gave you two breads. </sentence><sentence id="186">When I got to the <span class="dlf">line</span>, a Pole...a Polish kid came out and said to the German, "He's Jude." </sentence><sentence id="187">You know like...the German didn't even know that time...he didn't make any difference between a Jew and not a Jew; but the Polish kids, they were pointing out to the Germans, like "Don't give it to him. </sentence><sentence id="188">He's a Jew." </sentence><sentence id="189">So now they got the way... So the German couldn't do anything, I mean. </sentence><sentence id="190">So he chased us away. </sentence><sentence id="191">So when he chased us away, we stood again. </sentence><sentence id="192">So now, the Polish kids, they chased us away and they grabbed all the bread, and all the things. </sentence><sentence id="193">So we had to go <span class="building">home</span> without bread and without anything. </sentence><sentence id="194">And it was a fact that we had to go carry water from the <span class="dlf">Vistula</span>, from the <span class="env feature">river</span>; and this is like 4 miles. </sentence><sentence id="195">So we took 2 pails of water. </sentence><sentence id="196">Me and my sister took 2 pails of water, and we walked. </sentence><sentence id="197">We carried the pails so when we had to pass by a <span class="populated place">Polish neighborhood</span>, those Polish kids came out and picked up the pails of water and threw it out and make us walk back. </sentence><sentence id="198">Now this is in a time when the Germans took over the <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="199">Every citizen was on his own, and they know they lost their <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="200">Still the hatred. </sentence><sentence id="201">The anti- Semitism those Polish people had toward the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="202">For no reason at all! </sentence><sentence id="203">Now they felt that they can do with the German help what they always want to do. </sentence><sentence id="204">And here they got somebody to point out he's a Jew's and he's a this, and he's a that, and when they walked around with the water, they used to turn the water out from those kids, cause elderly people couldn't carry that far pails of water. </sentence><sentence id="205">So this went on for a couple of weeks. </sentence><sentence id="206">You know with that thing. </sentence><sentence id="207">Finally, the occupation was starting, and they started giving you anti-Jewish laws, and I remember like now, in November, I think it was in November or September, there was a <span class="dlf">street</span> in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>, the Nalevki. </sentence><sentence id="208">And somehow a Polish...a German soldier got shot. </sentence><sentence id="209">I don't  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection couldn't grab too much. </sentence><sentence id="210">And little by little, they cleaned out the <span class="building">warehouse</span>, they cleaned out the <span class="building">factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="211">They took away the <span class="spatial object">machines</span>. </sentence><sentence id="212">Everything they loaded up in <span class="spatial object">truck</span>, and I don't know where they had it. </sentence><sentence id="213">So from that little merchandize, what we saved from that <span class="building">factory</span>, we lived awhile. </sentence><sentence id="214">We sold little by little and somehow this kept us going for let's say, maybe 2 years, you know. </sentence><sentence id="215">And after...this was around 1941...1942. </sentence><sentence id="216">1941 or 42 it start getting very bad, because the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was closed in. </sentence><sentence id="217">They made a <span class="dlf">wall</span> around the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="218">I had to wear a arm band with the star of David. </sentence><sentence id="219">Say everybody, even the smallest children...my littlest sister, a little tiny girl...she had to walk out on the <span class="dlf">street</span>, she had a arm band, you know, with a...with a star of David. </sentence><sentence id="220">And everybody in the <span class="building">house</span> had always ready, uh, how you say a <span class="spatial object">rucksack</span> with a piece of bread, some stuff, in case something happened every kid will be protected. </sentence><sentence id="221">That was my father's idea. </sentence><sentence id="222">We don't know what's going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="223">First day here, they clean out this <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="224">They clean out this <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="225">You walk out in the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="226">You don't know if you gonna come back, because they ...you walk on the <span class="dlf">street</span> and they need 100 people to go to <span class="building">work</span>, they grab you and you don't...they don't know what happened to you. </sentence><sentence id="227">When we lived in that <span class="building">building</span>, we lived near a <span class="interior space">courtyard</span>. </sentence><sentence id="228">One time each <span class="building">house</span> had like a committee, and they were directing all the rules. </sentence><sentence id="229">One time there was a meeting and they said they need 35 people to go to work. </sentence><sentence id="230">So who'll they take? </sentence><sentence id="231">Elderly people, they can't take. </sentence><sentence id="232">The youngsters they can't take, so they took 17, 18, 19 year old people. </sentence><sentence id="233">And from that <span class="building">house</span> by us, we had to give them 3 people. </sentence><sentence id="234">So each <span class="building">house</span>, like 10 <span class="building">building</span>, used to give 30 people. </sentence><sentence id="235">And 3 people that went, 18, 19, they were 6 weeks away. </sentence><sentence id="236">When they came back, nobody recognized them. </sentence><sentence id="237">Each one was swelling. </sentence><sentence id="238">I remember that I had a friend. </sentence><sentence id="239">His name was Schemick. </sentence><sentence id="240">He came back. </sentence><sentence id="241">His feet, his hand, his head were twice the size from the beating,  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection mass graves. </sentence><sentence id="242">And every day thousands and thousands died just from malnutrition because the Germans didn't give anything for the people in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> to eat. </sentence><sentence id="243">There was no such thing. </sentence><sentence id="244">You couldn't walk in and buy anything or getting any rations. </sentence><sentence id="245">It's your pot luck. </sentence><sentence id="246">If you don't have it, you die, and that's what it was. </sentence><sentence id="247">Finally when they start bringing people out from the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, they promised the people, if you gonna leave the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, we'll give you 3...3 pounds of bread and, uh, a can of marmalade and sugar and stuff like this. </sentence><sentence id="248">And if you just register, you want to go to <span class="building">work</span>. </sentence><sentence id="249">Some people if they heard that word, 3 pounds of bread and marmalade and sugar, they didn't care what's going to happen to them. </sentence><sentence id="250">They just went and they signed up. </sentence><sentence id="251">Actually, it's not signed up because when they...when they went to that place, they got the bread and the marmalade and you see every day women, children walking to that place, Umschlagplatz, and get the 3 breads. </sentence><sentence id="252">And they pushed them into the <span class="spatial object">trains</span>; and they pushed in so many people in the <span class="spatial object">trains</span> that they actually couldn't eat that bread. </sentence><sentence id="253">There was no <span class="interior space">room</span> even to cut the bread. </sentence><sentence id="254">So what happened. </sentence><sentence id="255">Well, they send them to <span class="populated place">Treblinka</span>. </sentence><sentence id="256">The <span class="spatial object">trains</span> came back with the same bread because in the <span class="spatial object">trains</span> they used to put in 350 to 400 people in a <span class="spatial object">cattle car</span> and you had <span class="interior space">standing room</span> only. </sentence><sentence id="257">You couldn't even sit. </sentence><sentence id="258">You couldn't even stand. </sentence><sentence id="259">You were just pressed like sardines. </sentence><sentence id="260">So the bread and the marmalade when the people had it in their hands, it was still in their hands because when they get to destination in <span class="populated place">Treblinka</span>, they had to undress and they had to leave everything. </sentence><sentence id="261">So the same breads and the same marmalade came back for the new <span class="spatial object">transport</span>. </sentence><sentence id="262">And this went on constantly. </sentence><sentence id="263">Now the 22nd of July 1942, that was the day when I was <span class="building">home</span> and there was, uh, a...a raid. </sentence><sentence id="264">The SS came, start shooting, start hollering everybody down, everybody down in the <span class="interior space">court yard</span>, and I said to my mother, "What we gonna do?" </sentence><sentence id="265">So she says, "You don't have to worry. </sentence><sentence id="266">I got a paper. </sentence><sentence id="267">Your daddy works." </sentence><sentence id="268">My father was working as a mechanic in a...in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> for the...for the...in the <span class="building">factory</span> they used to make fur coats for the German flyers...for the pilots. </sentence><sentence id="269"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection along to make the 10,000 up. </sentence><sentence id="270">And that's what probably happened that day. </sentence><sentence id="271">They needed a couple of hundred more, and...and where we used to live was only about 10, 15 minutes from their <span class="dlf">Umshagplatz</span> where all the <span class="spatial object">trains</span> went to <span class="populated place">Treblinka</span>, so the first thing they did, ran into those <span class="dlf">court yards</span>, and they grabbed the people. </sentence><sentence id="272">And after this, uh, 6 o'clock, 7 o'clock, my father came <span class="building">home</span> and I told him what happened and I said to him, "Well, I...L...I can't be here anymore." </sentence><sentence id="273">You know, like I just can't find myself a place. </sentence><sentence id="274">First of all, I says you go away in the morning to work. </sentence><sentence id="275">I have to stay here by myself. </sentence><sentence id="276">And I don't know what can happen. </sentence><sentence id="277">Any minute they can grab me too because I have no papers. </sentence><sentence id="278">I don't work. </sentence><sentence id="279">And if you don't have no papers, you don't work. </sentence><sentence id="280">It's just like, uh, you don't exist. </sentence><sentence id="281">So I don't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="282">So I spoke...I had a friend of mine...a kid I went to <span class="building">school</span> with him, and he told me, "There is a guy who lives next <span class="building">house</span>, and he works on the on the <span class="building">airport</span> in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> for the Germans and he says for a couple... for some money he can arrange...that he can have a few people going to work in the <span class="building">airport</span>. </sentence><sentence id="283">This is a good job, and you can stay there and at least you're going to be safe a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="284">I told this to my father and I said to him, you know, we're going to need 2 or 3 thousand zlotys to pay off this guy cause this guy is going to pay off a German. </sentence><sentence id="285">And in that book I gave you is the whole story from that thing, but I just gonna tell you what happened. </sentence><sentence id="286">That's...some day he came. </sentence><sentence id="287">My father gave him the money. </sentence><sentence id="288">I took with me...1 remember like now...I took with me a <span class="spatial object">leather briefcase</span>. </sentence><sentence id="289">I took with me maybe 200 zlotys. </sentence><sentence id="290">That's all there was left, and I took with me some underwear and tfillin. </sentence><sentence id="291">My father says, "You take this." </sentence><sentence id="292">And I went because I was Bar mitzvah year before. </sentence><sentence id="293">So I didn't have a chance even to wear it. </sentence><sentence id="294">He says, "Take it with you." </sentence><sentence id="295">So I went and I took this. </sentence><sentence id="296">And I remember

</sentence><sentence id="1851">And left us <span class="building">tents</span>, and the German from this <span class="populated place">town</span> had to come every day and clean those <span class="building">tents</span> out and all that stuff. </sentence><sentence id="1852">And after the German had to come and dig a big <span class="dlf">hole</span> and they buried all the dead people that was laying around the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1853">It was a sight! </sentence><sentence id="1854">It was a sight because the <span class="spatial object">train</span> was on top, and the bottom was the <span class="dlf">highway</span>, and the people used to go from the <span class="spatial object">train</span> like this, falling down and you see all hanging on the <span class="env feature">bushes</span>, near a <span class="env feature">tree</span>, in the <span class="env feature">grass</span>, and you see men and women, and small men, and large men. </sentence><sentence id="1855">Everybody was laying spread over. </sentence><sentence id="1856">They were dead. </sentence><sentence id="1857">They were just couldn't...they just couldn't hold it on anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1858">The minute the <span class="spatial object">train</span> opened up, you see all falling out. </sentence><sentence id="1859">They were half...every <span class="spatial object">car</span> had half dead people inside. </sentence><sentence id="1860">Like I told you, only young people could have survived. </sentence><sentence id="1861">Only the youngsters. </sentence><sentence id="1862">And after this, me and one more guy went over there. </sentence><sentence id="1863">We took our little strength and we says, "We're gonna walk to a <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1864">And we walked in that uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="1865">We felt more strength, and I remember like now we came to a <span class="building">house</span> with a German woman inside, and she saw us and she started running. </sentence><sentence id="1866">She run away. </sentence><sentence id="1867">She saw both of us and we wore striped uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="1868">We walked in that <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1869">What a beautiful <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1870">All kind of china, with <span class="interior space">closets</span> with clothes. </sentence><sentence id="1871">First thing I did I took off my things. </sentence><sentence id="1872">I took out a shirt, and I put on a shirt. </sentence><sentence id="1873">This is the first time in 3, 4 years I had a shirt on my back. </sentence><sentence id="1874">Shoes I couldn't find, but I found a pair of rubber shoes. </sentence><sentence id="1875">I put on the rubber shoes. </sentence><sentence id="1876">And a pair of pants. </sentence><sentence id="1877">And after I saw her looking and I hollered to her, "Come here. </sentence><sentence id="1878">You know what I need some food, you know, to eat." </sentence><sentence id="1879">So she gave us some food. </sentence><sentence id="1880">But I saw her looking outside. </sentence><sentence id="1881">She looked...she looked outside. </sentence><sentence id="1882">I don't know what it was. </sentence><sentence id="1883">And there was a <span class="building">dog house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1884">And what do you think? </sentence><sentence id="1885">In the <span class="building">dog house</span>, there was a little girl, maybe 4 years old. </sentence><sentence id="1886">She was...she hid. </sentence><sentence id="1887">I went to her and I says, "Do you think I am going to harm you little girl? </sentence><sentence id="1888">Do you think I am going to be just like you people were? </sentence><sentence id="1889">I am not going to harm you, little girl. </sentence><sentence id="1890">You don't have to hide on the <span class="building">dog house</span>." </sentence><sentence id="1891">She didn't say a word, you know, when I said this to her. </sentence><sentence id="1892">But this little girl was laying in that <span class="building">dog house</span> hidden because she thought that...because this what they did to us, we're gonna to do to them. </sentence><sentence id="1893">And the same thing is when the Germans threw away those rifles by the <span class="spatial object">train</span>, I couldn't have picked up a rifle and killed all I wanted. </sentence><sentence id="1894">I couldn't even move. </sentence><sentence id="1895">I couldn't even pick that rifle up from the <span class="env feature">ground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1896">Probably maybe if I could, I would have feel maybe I would do it. </sentence><sentence id="1897">I couldn't even do this. </sentence><sentence id="1898">I couldn't even lift up the <span class="spatial object">rifle</span> that was laying on the <span class="env feature">ground</span> because first of all they are very heavy and second of all, I am not the type to kill anybody or to shoot. </sentence><sentence id="1899">First, in...in...especially when the war was going on, you could have walked around in every <span class="building">home</span> and do anything you wanted. </sentence><sentence id="1900">Nobody did those things. </sentence><sentence id="1901">Nobody did any revenging and killing just for no reason at all. </sentence><sentence id="1902">I don't remember those things. </sentence><sentence id="1903">And I saw people like me...there was no men, only women and children, because older men were in the war. </sentence><sentence id="1904">Nobody did any revenge . </sentence><sentence id="1905">And after this, they took us...yah, the MPs stopped us...2 MPs...Yes...and asked where are we going. </sentence><sentence id="1906">So I told him we were on a <span class="building">field hospital</span> from the army and now we gonna go. </sentence><sentence id="1907">We're looking for friends or family. </sentence><sentence id="1908">You know, do you say, "That's the only thing you had on your mind." </sentence><sentence id="1909">So they say, "You can't do that. </sentence><sentence id="1910">You are not allowed. </sentence><sentence id="1911">No. </sentence><sentence id="1912">You're now allowed to do this." </sentence><sentence id="1913">That was just war time. </sentence><sentence id="1914">You are not allowed to do this. </sentence><sentence id="1915">So they took us, put us in a <span class="spatial object">jeep</span>, and took us away, and point was already more people over there. </sentence><sentence id="1916">And
