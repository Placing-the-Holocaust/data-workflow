<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="10">Q: Did you ever experience any attacks or any --? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="12">A: Usually around Easter or Christmas time, the Jewish people used to be a little bit afraid and they used to lock their <span class="dlf">doors</span> because what they preached mostly in the <span class="building">churches</span>. </sentence><sentence id="13">When they come <span class="building">home</span> and they have a couple drinks or so, things were pretty rough, but otherwise we didn't have any problems. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="16">Q: Were you aware of what was going on in <span class="country">Germany</span> at this point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="18">A: No, we were aware very little of what was going on in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="19">Even when the Germans came in, we figured it's a war maybe things are going to change a little bit, but they closed in every time, there came some new rules out and it got to be very bad for the Jewish people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="22">Q: How large was your <span class="populated place">town</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="24">A: Our <span class="populated place">town</span> had about close to 10,000 population. </sentence><sentence id="25">4,500 of it were Jews, close to 50 percent. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="28">Q: Business and that was fairly integrated? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="30">A: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="32">Q: Now, you told me when the Germans came into in your <span class="populated place">town</span> and bomb fell on your <span class="building">house</span>, what was going on? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="34">A: September the Ist? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="36">Q: Yes, what was happening? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="38">A: We ran out from the <span class="building">house</span>, then we had to get another place to live. </sentence><sentence id="39">I think we moved in with our grandmother for a little while in a <span class="interior space">room</span> just to stay until things straightened a little bit out. </sentence><sentence id="40">Then when they moved us in and we stayed there for a while, and I got sick in 1940, I had the typhus, and I was lucky they put me away in a separate <span class="interior space">room</span> and nobody found out about it, and I survived somehow the typhus. </sentence><sentence id="41">Then I worked for the <span class="building">Jewish Community Center</span> at <span class="building">home</span>, because the Germans, when they made the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span>, made like the <span class="spatial object">Judenaut</span> which was a self -- you know the Jews governed themselves and I worked in the <span class="building">office</span> over there for them, until I sent away to , to the slave  some little things we could trade for food with the farmers from the outside and I even had a paper that I could go outside of the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span>, because I worked in the <span class="building">office</span> and I worked in the <span class="building">labor department</span>, in that section. </sentence><sentence id="42">I could see what started going on and I was very, very upset with all those things, and I figured that I couldn't stay over there too long, and I decided to get out and when I went to to the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, this was before they took all the Jewish people out from our <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="43">The fellow that took me out from there was an SS man by the name of . </sentence><sentence id="44">He said we have to go to , because there's a big <span class="building">ammunition factory</span> and we'll have to send a lot  difference. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="53">Q: Did you see that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="55">A: Oh, sure, absolutely. </sentence><sentence id="56">I remember the name. </sentence><sentence id="57">He was a Ukrainian, not really an SS, by the name of Schmitky, they used to call him. </sentence><sentence id="58">He was a very, very cruel man. </sentence><sentence id="59">He just came out. </sentence><sentence id="60">I remember right near our <span class="building">house</span> there was a fellow, his name was Littman, Phil Littman was his name, and I remember he shot him right in front of our <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="61">We were sitting inside. </sentence><sentence id="62">We were afraid even to go out. </sentence><sentence id="63">So those things were going on daily. </sentence><sentence id="64">It was a daily occurrence. </sentence><sentence id="65">It wasn't new. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="77">Q: Did your father keep up any this organizing <span class="interior space">underground</span>, the Zionism? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="79">A: I couldn't say because I don't remember and I don't think so. </sentence><sentence id="80">It's true that they got together and they talked about certain things, but very little could be done, because there was no help from the outside. </sentence><sentence id="81">In the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span> without help from the outside, it was very hard to organize anything, especially in a small <span class="populated place">town</span> like ours. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="85">Q: Did you observe <span class="spatial object">shobot</span>, holidays, anything? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="87">A: We used to observe it in the way we could. </sentence><sentence id="88">I remember my mother used to light candles every Friday, but as far as the food was concerned, we didn't have the food that we had before the war. </sentence><sentence id="89">If you had a little piece of bread and some potatoes it was enough just to survive. </sentence><sentence id="90">I used to help a little bit because I worked in the <span class="spatial object">Judenaut</span> and I had maybe my portion a little bit more so I usually used to bring it <span class="building">home</span> instead of eating so I can help out the family a little bit. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="95">Q: Tell me a little about the <span class="spatial object">Judenaut</span>, how you got that job? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="97">A: The way I got the job was the fellow who was running the <span class="spatial object">Judenaut</span>, was a very good friend of my father's, and that's how I got the job. </sentence><sentence id="98">It wasn't easy to get a job like this, because usually when you work for the <span class="building">Judenaut</span> and you're over there and all the food and everything came in, you always had a little bit more that you can have a little piece of bread more to eat, but I usually didn't eat it myself. </sentence><sentence id="99">I brought it <span class="building">home</span>, because I knew the rest of the family needed it more than I did, because they didn't have any other means to get their food from. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="103">Q: What other privileges did you get from working there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="105">A: The privileges that I had was that I wasn't called to work every day, that I was at <span class="building">home</span>, and I worked in the <span class="building">office</span>, and I had special papers that even I could walk outside of the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span>, if I had to go out for something. </sentence><sentence id="106">If you get out from the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span>, because you mix with the Gentile people outside, you could help yourself a little bit more. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="107">Q: Were you able to help your family by virtue of your position other than the food? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="108">A: No, not much. </sentence><sentence id="109">I had a younger brother, which I send him out to work one time, which they worked at , and it was named , the <span class="building">firm</span>. </sentence><sentence id="110">But  people we want to go, because you know there is always somebody who is a little better off or have other people, and we were watching out that the people in the position to help other people they should stay in place to help them, instead of sending them out of <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="114">Q: Can you give me any more ideas how they choose these 200 people versus another 200? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="116">A: Usually we try to take them according to alphabetical order, so we really, I don't think we made choices you know this person is going to go and this person is not going to go. </sentence><sentence id="117">I mentioned that there were certain people who were privileged. </sentence><sentence id="118">If he had some in his family, you know, he didn't send them out to a certain job that was very hard. </sentence><sentence id="119">He picked them out to go to a job that was a little easier. </sentence><sentence id="120">I imagine everybody did the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="121">If I could help some of my friends, I helped them. </sentence><sentence id="122">If I could help somebody else. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="130">Q: Were there women in the <span class="building">Judenaut</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="132">A: No, not too many that I can remember. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="134">Q: Were you aware of any sort of manipulation of the <span class="spatial object">Judenaut</span> toward other people because of their special power? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="136">A: I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="137">There might have been in the higher echelon, but I wasn't in the higher echelon to be able to tell you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="140">Q: The <span class="building">Judenaut</span> also took care of food and everything else? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="142">A: That's right. </sentence><sentence id="143">They used to dispense the food. </sentence><sentence id="144">They used to get it, and then divide it. </sentence><sentence id="145">The people used to have little <span class="spatial object">carts</span> that you used to come to collect your food, once a week or twice a week. </sentence><sentence id="146">We also had <span class="interior space">soup kitchens</span> that we set up in order to help the people that didn't have a place to cook or couldn't help themselves. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="152">Q: Anything else about the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span> that you can think of? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="154">A: The <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span> was very, very bad, and lot of people when they had people who hardly had anything, if they heard about a good job that was outside, that the Germans took you away, they wanted to go because the Germans never told you that they were going to take you to a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> or somewhere else. </sentence><sentence id="155">They said we have here, we need some people to send out the job. </sentence><sentence id="156">We're going to take you and you're going to be living over there and you're going to be all right. </sentence><sentence id="157">So, a lot of people even went by themselves because they figured they would be better off than being in the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span> because the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span> was very bad. </sentence><sentence id="158">You didn't have enough to eat and there was a lot of starvation and sickness going on. </sentence><sentence id="159">We didn't know really until later on what was going on in the <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>, because even I, myself, didn't believe until I got to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> that they're really gassing and burning people until I saw it myself. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="160">Q: So, you were already in ? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="161">A: Yes, in 1942 I was in , and I worked over there in the <span class="interior space">building section</span>. </sentence><sentence id="162">It was a very, very big place. </sentence><sentence id="163">We lived right in the <span class="building">factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="164">It was like a whole <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="165">It was one of the largest <span class="building">ammunition factories</span> in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="166">That's where I got to know my wife over there in 1942 because women and men were in the same <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="167">We lived in separate <span class="building">barracks</span>, but we were in the same <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="168">The <span class="populated place">camp</span> was really watched by a Ukrainian. </sentence><sentence id="169">The Germans were in charge, but Ukrainians were watching our <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="170">It was pretty tough over there, but we had a little bit more to eat. </sentence><sentence id="171">We worked but we mixed with other nationalities. </sentence><sentence id="172">The Polish people worked in the same <span class="building">factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="173">At night time we used to come <span class="building">home</span> and still see our friends and everybody else. </sentence><sentence id="174">We tried to help each other as much as we can. </sentence><sentence id="175">Let's say, if somebody could bring a little piece out from the outside and he could share it somebody else, he usually shared it with somebody else. </sentence><sentence id="176">We found out after the war that the fellow that was in charge of our <span class="populated place">camp</span> over there, he was a German by the name of Brant, that thanks to him, that <span class="populated place">labor camp</span> was a little bit better, that we didn't suffer as much as in other <span class="populated place">camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="177">He was caught after the war in the and he was telling the things that he was doing for us. </sentence><sentence id="178">I know when they took us away to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, he went to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> and told them that , we were very  a liking to me. </sentence><sentence id="179">I learned a little bit of trade over there. </sentence><sentence id="180">By the end of 1944 I think it was in November, when the <span class="country">United States</span> and the Russians started progressing more on <span class="country">Germany</span>, and the Germans used to have their <span class="building">shops</span> on the <span class="dlf">front lines</span> in <span class="spatial object">trains</span>, and they bunked a lot of those <span class="spatial object">trains</span>, they brought a lot of our men to the <span class="building">train factory</span> to be fixed. </sentence><sentence id="181">The soldiers that were in those <span class="spatial object">trains</span>, came with them. </sentence><sentence id="182">They usually waited until the <span class="spatial object">trains</span> were fixed, so they put on another shift. </sentence><sentence id="183">Before they put on another shift, the SS man came in. </sentence><sentence id="184">His name was Fox. </sentence><sentence id="185">He said, each one he assigned us a <span class="spatial object">train</span>, a pullman to go out and check on those pullman. </sentence><sentence id="186">I went out to mine because I didn't know the <span class="spatial object">train</span>, but I knew how to write and read and I made a plan of the <span class="spatial object">train</span> and I showed him where the damage was and what we're going to fix. </sentence><sentence id="187">When he came on and asked everybody what to do, he came to me and after I showed him those, he says you're going to run the second shift. </sentence><sentence id="188">I couldn't tell the men. </sentence><sentence id="189">I took the bull by the horn. </sentence><sentence id="190">I figured listen I had to take a chance because I had different nationals working under me in the second shift. </sentence><sentence id="191">We went out to work, and we did the job so fast that we got a little bit tobacco extra and I never smoked. </sentence><sentence id="192">Usually everything I got, I shared it with the people. </sentence><sentence id="193">They knew that I didn't know the trade, but they couldn't tell the men that I don't know it either as long as I was put in charge, I was put in charge over the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="194">That's where I learned my trade. </sentence><sentence id="195">When I came to the <span class="country">United States</span>, that's the trade I went into, and I built up a <span class="building">shop</span> in <span class="populated place">Washington DC</span> and thank God I was very successful, and that's how I made a living in the <span class="country">United States</span> when I came over here. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="231">Q: I want to learn a little bit more detail about some of these <span class="populated place">camps</span>, these <span class="populated place">labor camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="232">Your interaction with the other people, with the guards, what your daily life was like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="235">A: In <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> we didn't have any interaction with the guards. </sentence><sentence id="236">You're very, very scared of them. </sentence><sentence id="237">I'm going to tell you an incident which happened to me. </sentence><sentence id="238">I worked in the <span class="building">sheet metal shop</span>, and I used to make things out of little pieces of copper that I used to find, other things, some rings. </sentence><sentence id="239">I used to exchange them for little pieces of bread. </sentence><sentence id="240">I was called one day, and this was about the end of November 1944, and the men took my number and usually every Sunday the persecutions were going on, because we didn't work. </sentence><sentence id="241">Anybody did something that they didn't like, they used to hang them and then send them away to the <span class="building">crematoriums</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="249">Q: This is which <span class="populated place">camp</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="251">A: <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="252">And I already knew what was going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="253">I figured my gosh how can I get out of it. </sentence><sentence id="254">I knew what was going to happen to me on Sunday because I was caught with materials that , which means they are materials they use during  weeks in order to have it for you as a present and I would like you to have it. </sentence><sentence id="255">It went away, I never heard any thing more about it. </sentence><sentence id="256">They never called me. </sentence><sentence id="257">The commander got to know me very well because we went out through the <span class="dlf">gate</span> a lot of times. </sentence><sentence id="258">He used to knock me on the shoulders when we went out. </sentence><sentence id="259">That's how I survived from going to the <span class="building">crematoriums</span> one time. </sentence><sentence id="260">We had to think sometimes. </sentence><sentence id="261">When the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span> was liquidated, my whole family went to <span class="populated place">Treblinka</span>, and they all perished in the <span class="building">crematorium</span> in <span class="populated place">Treblinka</span>. </sentence><sentence id="262">That's what I found out at , a couple weeks later after I was there. </sentence><sentence id="263"> 0 the clothes and they gave us other clothes. </sentence><sentence id="264">But, we had selections every Sunday. </sentence><sentence id="265">They looked us through, and if somebody didn't look so good, they took them out and they send them away to the <span class="building">crematoriums</span>. </sentence><sentence id="266">They brought in other people to replace them. </sentence><sentence id="267">The food we got in the morning, you had to get up about 4:00 in the morning and we stayed outside. </sentence><sentence id="268">They called it Appeal, that they counted us, every morning, and if somebody was missing, we had to stay outside, cold or rain didn't make any difference until the men were found. </sentence><sentence id="269">Because sometimes somebody died during the night and never even came out, or something happened, but we had to wait. </sentence><sentence id="270">And if they didn't count us, we didn't couldn't go to work until everything was counted. </sentence><sentence id="271">Then we had about five miles, maybe four miles that we would have to walk from the <span class="populated place">camp</span> to the <span class="building">factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="272">The music was playing near the <span class="dlf">gate</span> where we went out, and the music was playing at night when we came <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="273">We got a little piece of bread, about six of us got one pound of bread. </sentence><sentence id="274">The bread was made out, you could feel the straw inside that you could hardly eat it, but we had to eat it because you had to survive on something. </sentence><sentence id="275">We got a little bit, it was like tea. </sentence><sentence id="276">They said it was a special tea that was made that we drank a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="277">Then in the middle of the day you got a little bit of soup which was mostly water. </sentence><sentence id="278">Then at night, when we came <span class="building">home</span>, either we got another little piece of soup or we got another little piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="279">This was our food for a whole day. </sentence><sentence id="280">Things were very, very bad, because a lot of people, we didn't have enough food, they used to get diarrhea and they used to get sick. </sentence><sentence id="281">The minute you got sick a little bit, you were taken out, and we alot of times when we went out to work and maybe 2,000 people, and the men says I only want 1,800 back and by the time we got back, we had <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> behind us that they killed off the rest of them. </sentence><sentence id="282">We just loaded on the <span class="spatial object">truck</span> the ones that couldn't keep up with --you know, because we walked from the <span class="building">factory</span> to the thing. </sentence><sentence id="283">The ones that couldn't keep up with it, they killed them on the <span class="dlf">road</span>, and they put them on the <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> and then they took them away to the <span class="building">crematoriums</span>. </sentence><sentence id="284">But we couldn't help ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="285">We couldn't even escape because on the outside there was nobody to help us. </sentence><sentence id="286">I had a friend that escaped from the <span class="spatial object">trains</span> when they took us on the <span class="spatial object">trains</span> and got into the <span class="env feature">woods</span>, and when he came back, he was taken to <span class="populated place">Treblinka</span> at that time. </sentence><sentence id="287">His name was . </sentence><sentence id="288">I'll never forget. </sentence><sentence id="289">He came back, he said listen don't go on those <span class="spatial object">trains</span> because they burn you over there and we thought that the man was crazy. </sentence><sentence id="290">We didn't believe him. </sentence><sentence id="291">We said how can they tell living people and burn them especially you know in our days? </sentence><sentence id="292">And another thing that we couldn't understand it's as if the world would know that those things would go on, we are taught that somebody outside must know because if they would know what was going on in here, they couldn't sit outside and not do anything about it. </sentence><sentence id="293">But, we never got any help from the outside. </sentence><sentence id="294">When he was on the outside and was in the <span class="env feature">woods</span>, he said he couldn't stay over there because they wanted to kill him because , so he  1 this thing couldn't last on forever. </sentence><sentence id="295">But, it was very easy to commit suicide. </sentence><sentence id="296">All you had to do was through yourself on the <span class="dlf">wires</span>, because the <span class="dlf">wires</span> were electric. </sentence><sentence id="297">They had 600 volts in them. </sentence><sentence id="298">And a lot of people did it. </sentence><sentence id="299">But, if we found out that somebody was very despondent and we felt that he was going to do something, we tried to talk to him and tell him listen, the <span class="region">outside world</span> cannot sit like t his and watch what's going on here and not do anything. </sentence><sentence id="300">It looks like the war is already coming to an end. </sentence><sentence id="301">We knew little things what were going on because we didn't have any <span class="spatial object">radios</span>. </sentence><sentence id="302">We didn't have any papers, and nobody was telling us anything because even the Germans that worked with us in the <span class="building">factory</span> were afraid to talk to us, because if they noticed that they talk to us too much, they took him away. </sentence><sentence id="303">They took them away, too. </sentence><sentence id="304">So, we tried to help each other as much as we could in order to survive. </sentence><sentence id="305">And thank God some of us survived. </sentence><sentence id="306">When they took us out on the Death March --. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="363">Q: Wait a minute, we haven't talked about the Death March yet so we need to set that up. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="684">A: Those images come back to me all the time. </sentence><sentence id="685">There's plenty of nights that I talk to people about them. </sentence><sentence id="686">I usually don't talk about those things during the day, and I told I have to be busy in order to forget those things, but I wake up in the middle of the night still seeing all those monstrosities and everything else. </sentence><sentence id="687">I can't talk about them a lot of times, but I can see them and I feel them. </sentence><sentence id="688">I wake up in a sweat and it's very hard for me to get back to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="689">If we get together with our friends that went through, that's all we talk about. </sentence><sentence id="690">We can't talk about anything else. </sentence><sentence id="691">Thank God we have three children. </sentence><sentence id="692">We have seven grandchildren and I ask my kids, I said when you were younger when they were very little and they saw my number when they were two years, two and half, they asked me what is that number I used to tell them some bad people did it to me. </sentence><sentence id="693">But later on they never asked us any questions because they realized they heard us talk to our friends all the time, and they knew that something very bad happened to us during that time. </sentence><sentence id="694">Even now, they tell us that's why we didn't want to ask you about it. </sentence><sentence id="695">We knew what you went through but we didn't want to ask you about it. </sentence><sentence id="696">Even now, after 50 years, it's very, very hard to talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="697">But then we figured we have to establish a new life when we came over here. </sentence><sentence id="698">We worked very hard. </sentence><sentence id="699">I worked seven days a week, 20 hours, as many hours as it took in order to build up what I did, and thank God it's a wonderful <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="700">I wouldn't like to live anywhere else, and I appreciate everything that the <span class="country">United States</span> did for me. </sentence><sentence id="701">And I'm paying taxes every year too, and I don't mind. </sentence><sentence id="702">They've been very good to me here and since I came to the <span class="country">United States</span>, I've worked mostly for the government. </sentence><sentence id="703">I did a lot of work -- I have clearance with the F.B.I., with the <span class="spatial object">C.I.A.</span>, and I never forget when I came over to this <span class="country">country</span> and I worked at and I worked at the and in the middle of the day, one of the soldiers came over and took me up to and I got very scared. </sentence><sentence id="704">I thought I was in <span class="country">Germany</span> again. </sentence><sentence id="705">They were going to send me away somewhere else, and I found out the reason I was taken off of the job was because I didn't have my citizenship papers. </sentence><sentence id="706">I was not a citizen and it was a job in those days was very secret and that I can't work over there  1 in the <span class="building">White House</span> when Nixon was making the tapes. </sentence><sentence id="707">We worked around the clock for 24 hours in order to get the air conditioning and ventilation in the <span class="interior space">basement</span>. </sentence><sentence id="708">I'm thankful for everything. </sentence><sentence id="709">I have a very nice family and I hope that we stay well that I can do more what I want to do to help other people which is very, very important. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="737">Q: Is there anything else you want to add about those years? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="739">A: I don't want to go through the <span class="env feature">monstrosities</span> to tell you what's going on too much. </sentence><sentence id="740">I get very, you know, I'm but if you have any special questions you want to ask me that you want me to say about I'll be glad to answer. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="743">Q: You have to appreciate that someone, sometime might look at this tape and say monstrosities, maybe they're going to want to know more what that means? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="745">A: The only thing I can say that not all people are bad. </sentence><sentence id="746">They are some good people with the bad ones too. </sentence><sentence id="747">Even there were in <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>, and I worked with a German that was running the <span class="building">factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="748">It's true that he lost three sons in the war and he didn't like Hitler too much either, but he always every day, he knew what was going on, brought something in, like an apple sometime, a little piece of bread, but he told me don't take it until I go out from here, because if they catch me I'll be in trouble, and he put it away at a certain place and then I left, before I left I used to go out and get it and I used to come <span class="building">home</span>, you know, back to the <span class="building">barracks</span>, I used to share it with my friends. </sentence><sentence id="749">The fellow when were in the fellow that was in charge of our <span class="building">barrack</span> was a German by the name of Walter, and I found out that he killed his parents and they put him in <span class="building">jail</span> and then they put him in charge of us. </sentence><sentence id="750">I also found out later that it was a homosexual which I didn't even know what a homosexual really was when I was in <span class="populated place">camp</span> in those days, but he also had a girlfriend in the <span class="building">factory</span> and he spoke German and she spoke only Polish and when he found out he took me to carry the letters from the <span class="building">factory</span> back to <span class="populated place">camp</span> from him to her because he couldn't go out from <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="751">We went to <span class="building">work</span>, but he stayed over the whole day and took care of it, so usually when I came <span class="building">home</span> at night he had this special soup for me which I shared with my friends and this means almost difference between life and death, this soup. </sentence><sentence id="752">And also, in the winter time it was very cold over there, but because we worked in the <span class="building">train factory</span> an the <span class="spatial object">trains</span> were running on coal, so we made up that each man that came back took a little piece of coal and put it in his pocket, very little piece, maybe a centimeter and half by centimeter and half, and when we came back to the <span class="building">barracks</span>, we had a little <span class="spatial object">bellie stove</span>, a little <span class="spatial object">iron stove</span> and the fellow that was running, that Walter, the German that was running the <span class="populated place">camp</span> didn't mind and everybody threw the little piece of coal in that little <span class="spatial object">stove</span> and we had it a little bit warmer at night. </sentence><sentence id="753">We were one of the lucky ones maybe. </sentence><sentence id="754">You had to help yourself a little. </sentence><sentence id="755">You couldn't take too much of that coal back, but a little piece, nobody noticed when you went through the <span class="dlf">gate</span> and coming in with it and that's how we kept warm at night in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="756">I imagine that we're also lucky that they took us instead of  2 survived there because usually they came in they picked them to do certain jobs, to take the clothes away when we came off they took the clothes away from the people then they sorted the clothes, then they took the people, you know. </sentence><sentence id="757">If you were picked to do a job you couldn't help it. </sentence><sentence id="758">You took the people from the <span class="interior space">gas chambers</span> and put them in the <span class="building">crematoriums</span> and it was people like us. </sentence><sentence id="759">You know, they picked them out and that's what you did. </sentence><sentence id="760">So, they use you as long as you could do it and if you got tired of doing it, they put you in the <span class="building">crematorium</span> and picked somebody else to do it. </sentence><sentence id="761">So, it wasn't something like just -- in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> that I was in they used to hang people every Sunday and everybody that did something bad, they used to hang them on Sunday. </sentence><sentence id="762">They used to pick up people from the <span class="spatial object">rolls</span> after they stayed on that appeal in the morning and we used to hang them. </sentence><sentence id="763">They didn't do it themselves. </sentence><sentence id="764">Used to go out and put the thing on their neck, but you couldn't help it. </sentence><sentence id="765">Luckily I wasn't picked, but maybe if I would be picked I would have to do the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="766">It was one of those things. </sentence><sentence id="767">Another thing in those <span class="populated place">camps</span>, in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> Sunday when we didn't go to <span class="building">work</span> even if it was cold, we had to stay outside the hole day. </sentence><sentence id="768">They wouldn't let us go into the <span class="building">barracks</span> and sit inside because we were going to make it dirty. </sentence><sentence id="769">The <span class="interior space">floors</span> are going to be dirty. </sentence><sentence id="770">We had to make our <span class="spatial object">bed</span> as much as we could every morning and then you were sick you were afraid to go to the <span class="building">infirmary</span> because you knew what was going to happen to you. </sentence><sentence id="771">I'll never forget I cut myself once in my arm here, right here, and I was afraid to go, and I don't know what I did but I put a piece of rope on one side and on the other side and it just healed up and I used to go to <span class="building">work</span>, and I used to be sick. </sentence><sentence id="772">I used to get a sore throat and a fever. </sentence><sentence id="773">I used to go to <span class="building">work</span>. </sentence><sentence id="774">I never stayed in the <span class="building">barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="775">I figured if I stay I know what's going to happen to me, so this way I just went through and when we went <span class="building">home</span>, walking, we used to hold tight, used to hold each other in to the ends and my friends if I couldn't go my friends were dragging me in until we got in there. </sentence><sentence id="776">I used to take my friends until we got back to <span class="populated place">camp</span>, and that's how I survived. </sentence><sentence id="777">We helped each other. </sentence><sentence id="778">If not we wouldn't be here. </sentence><sentence id="779">Even when I escaped, I'll never forget I can't even remember they said I was in the <span class="env feature">woods</span> it was so bad, but we survived somehow. </sentence><sentence id="780">It's amazing what a human being can stand when it happens. </sentence><sentence id="781">There was no place for us to escape because there was no body that helped a Jew on the outside. </sentence><sentence id="782">Maybe in another <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="783">Maybe in <span class="country">Holland</span> or <span class="country">Belgium</span> or <span class="country">France</span> but not in <span class="country">Poland</span> because most of the <span class="building">crematoriums</span> were built in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="784">Even from the <span class="country">countries</span>, they brought them into <span class="country">Poland</span>, like <span class="populated place">Birkenau</span>, <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, <span class="populated place">Maidonek</span>. </sentence><sentence id="785"><span class="populated place">Maidonek</span>, is a <span class="populated place">camp</span> that still the Germans didn't have time to destroy it and it's still, they can start up a ration over there in two days if they had to. </sentence><sentence id="786">The <span class="building">crematoriums</span> and everything is over there. </sentence><sentence id="787">That's why I took the march of the living kids who went to <span class="populated place">Maidonek</span>. </sentence><sentence id="788">It's not only the Jews that got killed during the war. </sentence><sentence id="789">A lot of the Russian prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="790">When I was in there was a camp of Russian  3 I have an American that was in the
