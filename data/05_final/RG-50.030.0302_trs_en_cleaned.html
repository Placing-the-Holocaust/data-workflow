<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="55">Q: Did you have any brothers or sisters? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="57">A: No brothers, no sisters. </sentence><sentence id="58">I had a lot of cousins who I saw quite a bit. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="61">Q: What about <span class="building">school</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="63">A: Oh, I don't remember much about <span class="building">school</span> except that I loved my teachers. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="65">Q: Was it a <span class="building">public school</span> or a ? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="67">A: I don't remember that there were any other Jews in that <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="68">It was a <span class="populated place">suburb</span> of <span class="populated place">Manue</span> (ph) where we lived, and I know there were no other Jews in that <span class="populated place">town</span> from the things that my parents have said to me. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="69">Q: And did that cause any confusion? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="70">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="71">My parents were both and I was brought up with no consciousness of being Jewish at all. </sentence><sentence id="72">One of my sets of cousins was terribly terribly Catholic. </sentence><sentence id="73">And, I remember thinking it's kind of a silly waste of time to have to spend so much time praying and going to <span class="building">church</span> and all that, because it's their business. </sentence><sentence id="74">And my other cousins who weren't Jewish were really not practicing Jews in the same way that we were. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="80">Q: Was there any conscious -- political consciousness about 2 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="82"> "As No, my parents were both -- I guess they both felt -- especially my dad, that they belong to the Russian Italian Embessy. </sentence><sentence id="83">I guess that my mother didn't. </sentence><sentence id="84">My mother was really very high politicalized person, but she was much broader, my father was not. </sentence><sentence id="85">And my father belonged to that category of Jews who had aligned themselves with the Russian Communist Party to a great extent. </sentence><sentence id="86">And really thought of themselves as Russians not as Jews. </sentence><sentence id="87">And felt that they had been totally accepted in the world of Russians on . </sentence><sentence id="88">That is what he felt. </sentence><sentence id="89">And so one of my uncles had gone to <span class="country">Pakistan</span> and came back and was disappointed in it. </sentence><sentence id="90">I never met him really from the time I was a child until the time I was an adult, I was never really able to talk to him about his feelings or his experiences in <span class="country">Pakistan</span>. </sentence><sentence id="91">Now my other uncle had run a communist army and went out and fought in the army and stayed in <span class="country">Russia</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="102">Q: The reason I am asking this is I am trying to get a sense of how the weren't practicing at all. </sentence><sentence id="103">What really -- how you identified with being Jewish? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="106">A: I didn't. </sentence><sentence id="107">I didn't until I was in my teens. </sentence><sentence id="108">Until way way after the war. </sentence><sentence id="109">As far as I could see there were the Germans and they were the enemy. </sentence><sentence id="110">And then there were all the French speaking people. </sentence><sentence id="111">And they were the good guys that included the French and the Belgiums. </sentence><sentence id="112">And then of course, the Flemish (ph) Belgiums. </sentence><sentence id="113">And, I wasn't really too conscious of the Dutch. </sentence><sentence id="114">But I was conscious of the British as being the good guy which was a little bit confusing later on. </sentence><sentence id="115">Because, I knew that <span class="populated place">Wellington</span> was the bad guy. </sentence><sentence id="116">My historical concepts got very very mixed up. </sentence><sentence id="117">But at that time the British were good and the French were super good and the Germans were super bad. </sentence><sentence id="118">And so I really put down all the horrors of war to the conflict between the good guys and the bad guys. </sentence><sentence id="119">And I wasn't really conscious of the bad things that they were doing to the Jews because they were equally bad things to people that I knew and saw around me. </sentence><sentence id="120">Now by the time we got to the South of <span class="country">France</span> and I got myself situated or I didn't, my history did. </sentence><sentence id="121">I got me situated in a <span class="populated place">village</span> where there were many many Jews living as well, even though I still considered myself French. </sentence><sentence id="122">I began to get a sense of the bad things that were being done to the Jews and -- but I still wasn't clear that I was a Jew at all. </sentence><sentence id="123">I just thought that these were poor people who were being treated shamelessly, and so it was kind of difficult. </sentence><sentence id="124">But later on -- oh, maybe about seven or eight or ten years ago, but no more than that, I met somebody in <span class="populated place">New York City</span>. </sentence><sentence id="125">Quite by accident, who had been the daughter of one of the villagers in one of the smaller <span class="populated place">villages</span> that we lived in. </sentence><sentence id="126">And she and her husband had been running a <span class="building">restaurant</span> in <span class="populated place">New York City</span> and distributing leaphlets to their <span class="building">restaurant</span> in front of the <span class="spatial object">tickets booth</span> on <span class="dlf">42nd Street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="127">And, I  was teading a French book and that got us into a conversation which finally ended up by telling her where I was from and she said "Oh my goodness, she was from there. </sentence><sentence id="128">When did I live there?" </sentence><sentence id="129">Very suspiciously she asked me this and I told her and she looked at me and she said "Oh, were you the <span class="country">Belgiums</span> or the Jews?" </sentence><sentence id="130">So which really brought home to me the fact that I wasn't the only one that considered myself not a part of this <span class="building">Jewish community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="131">Because there were many -- I don't know, there were quite a few maybe 20, 30, Jewish people who were living there, you know, under <span class="populated place">village</span> arrest. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="158">Q: You wete aware that you were Jews but you weren't aware of the double risk? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="160">A: Absolutely not. </sentence><sentence id="161">I didn't realize that anybody was at a double risk. </sentence><sentence id="162">And I was a small child and quite innocent. </sentence><sentence id="163">My knowledge of war came from literature. </sentence><sentence id="164">And in literature there is no such thing as this. </sentence><sentence id="165">At least not the literature that you read when you ate six or seven years old. </sentence><sentence id="166">There ate good guys and there are bad guys, and that is basically it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="174">Q: Let's go back to <span class="country">Belgium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="175">I want you to tell me a little about what you were, your family knew about Hitler or Naziism (ph) before <span class="country">Belgium</span> ? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="178">A: I knew nothing. </sentence><sentence id="179">My father, I really don't know. </sentence><sentence id="180">My father obviously knew everything that my mother did because she would have shared it with him. </sentence><sentence id="181">My mother was a clinical scientist and she said that when I was born, she cried and cried and cried and cried because it was 1933 and she could see what was coming. </sentence><sentence id="182">So she was very aware. </sentence><sentence id="183">And I know that when I was a child there had been many many conversations about immigrating. </sentence><sentence id="184">And my father kept saying no, we will be okay and my mother kept saying, no we got to go. </sentence><sentence id="185">At one point they -- my mother and I, went to <span class="country">Romania</span> (ph) where my maternal grandparents were living and we went to where my maternal grandmother was living. </sentence><sentence id="186">You see my maternal grandparents and my maternal grandmother were living and to try to get them out. </sentence><sentence id="187">At one point my maternal grandparents did leave <span class="country">Romania</span> (ph) and they went to visit their son who at this time, that's the man who had gone to live on _____ at one point. </sentence><sentence id="188">And he was now living in <span class="country">Argentina</span> with his wife and two children. </sentence><sentence id="189">I guess maybe that he didn't even have two children at that time. </sentence><sentence id="190">Yeah, but anyway they went to visit him and they decided they really wanted to go <span class="building">home</span>, they didn't feel comfortable. </sentence><sentence id="191">They felt that maybe they were too old to take on this culture. </sentence><sentence id="192">My mother and father argued with them that a Spanish culture was something very foreign to them. </sentence><sentence id="193">French or <span class="country">Belgium</span> culture would be something they would be much more familiar with, at least through their education, etcetera etcetera and tried to convince them to stay in <span class="country">Belgium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="194">They declined this as well and went on back. </sentence><sentence id="195">And then in 1937 my mother and I went to <span class="country">Romania</span> (ph) and <span class="country">Russia</span>, and tried to get my grandparents to leave, to no avail. </sentence><sentence id="196">So that is how much my patents knew, a great deal, a great great deal. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="216">Q: What do you remember about this when it happened, how things started changing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="218"> Pats Well, we didn't stay. </sentence><sentence id="219">But how it happened was very sudden, it happened overnight. </sentence><sentence id="220">It happened in one or two days. </sentence><sentence id="221">And I went to <span class="building">school</span> one day and the school teacher told us  that they were passing out flowers in a <span class="interior space">corner</span> and we should take these flowers and take the petals off of them and put them in <span class="spatial object">baskets</span>. </sentence><sentence id="222">Because, the next day our armys would come on through on their way to fight the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="223">And so we did this to the <span class="env feature">flowers</span> and a great deal of hooplah and horay horay, we ate going to be saved. </sentence><sentence id="224">The next day we were excused from <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="225">And, my <span class="building">parents house</span> was on a main <span class="dlf">toad</span> which was a <span class="dlf">two-lane highway</span> but was still a main <span class="dlf">road</span>. </sentence><sentence id="226">And, the troops came marching down the main <span class="dlf">road</span> where everybody who lived anywhere near was out on the <span class="dlf">streets</span>. </sentence><sentence id="227">And people had bread and they had cheese and they had wine and lots and lots and lots of wine which they gave to the soldiers wishing them well and wishing them luck and children would throw petals on the soldiers marching by. </sentence><sentence id="228">It was very glorious and very very glorious and three days later they came back or four days later or something, you know. </sentence><sentence id="229">The wat was won, the Germans had walked all over them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="242">Q: How was the mood? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="244">A: Well, they went from total elation to total defeat, I mean not good. </sentence><sentence id="245">There is a very very powerful poem written by -- I believe it is . </sentence><sentence id="246">It just basically sets the tone for this you know, it says: The month of May was the month of roses and the month of lilies, and the month of June had a dagger in its heart. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="250">Q: Were the people in your <span class="populated place">town</span> trying to deal with this in any certain way? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="252">A: I don't think -- I may be wrong. </sentence><sentence id="253">But I really don't think, apart from the political groups, that people in <span class="region">Northern France</span> and <span class="country">Belgium</span> and maybe more <span class="country">France</span> than that to, were really so aware of the Nazis as being different from the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="254">Don't forget that the French and the Germans had these conflicts for centuries. </sentence><sentence id="255">And the most recent one was in 1914 and it was a question of land grabbing and wanting more power and this had already been done through the <span class="building">Eastern Army</span> that was what <span class="country">Poland</span> was all about. </sentence><sentence id="256">And that's what parts of were all about and so I think, although I have no reason to say that, other than what I have read since. </sentence><sentence id="257">But people were probably more conscious with the fact that this was another devastating war that was going to take place. </sentence><sentence id="258">But, I don't think that anybody thought of it as strictly political war or even any political overtones. </sentence><sentence id="259">I think that came quite a bit later. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="269">Q: Now, while you were in <span class="country">Belgium</span>, did you come in contact with German troops? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="271"> Pats No, not at all. </sentence><sentence id="272">While I was in <span class="country">Belgium</span> and when my father went to work one day, oh -- within a week or so of the occupation and his boss said to him that he felt that my dad should take his family and leave. </sentence><sentence id="273">That he wasn't a <span class="country">Belgium</span> number one, and that he was a Jew, number two, and that he was at great, great risk. </sentence><sentence id="274">So he gave my father what amounted to six month salary and he said "God Bless You," and when he gave my dad a letter of introduction to his sister <span class="building">factory</span> in __ and we left. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="279">Q: Let me just ask you one question while we are on that. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="280">A: Sure. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="281">Q: So even the short time and we are talking a few weeks -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="283">A: No, we are talking -- yeah maybe two. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="285">Q: Were your activities restricted? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="287">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="289">Q: Was there any sense -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="291">A: No that is what I was going to tell you. </sentence><sentence id="292">Yes, things changed terribly from the day of the petal throwing to the day that we left which was somewhere between seven and ten days later. </sentence><sentence id="293">I mean we ate talking about a very short period of time. </sentence><sentence id="294">What happened is that the routine my life had followed until that day became nonexistent. </sentence><sentence id="295">Nobody seemed to care whether I was fed or not. </sentence><sentence id="296">I had a maid, my parents had a maid who was usually about 17 years old or so that took care of me. </sentence><sentence id="297">So she was mote ot less like a mother's helper more than anything else. </sentence><sentence id="298">Anyway, this young girl had gotten quite sick with and she had gone to live with her parents and I think she died. </sentence><sentence id="299">I didn't know very well what had happened to her but I know she was a nurse so she wasn't taking care of me. </sentence><sentence id="300">So for the first time there was nobody but my mom to take care of me. </sentence><sentence id="301">My parents and my neighbors were crouched over a <span class="spatial object">radio</span> most of the time. </sentence><sentence id="302">Certainly in the evening from five or six o'clock on there was this crowd of people a holding on to this <span class="spatial object">radio</span>. </sentence><sentence id="303">I could go on and do whatever I wanted to. </sentence><sentence id="304">I could go to <span class="spatial object">bed</span> whenever I wanted to. </sentence><sentence id="305">I remember staying out and watching it getting dark and I've never seen it get dark outside before. </sentence><sentence id="306">I continued to go to <span class="building">school</span>, nobody at <span class="building">school</span> seemed to care about what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="307">It was a terrific change for several days and after that we left and we went up and took my mothers <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> and I can't remember if we took my dad's <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> as well, I think we did. </sentence><sentence id="308">And we took a <span class="spatial object">suitcase</span> and we took my mothers -- my mother had an old battered fur coat which her mother had maybe given her ten years before or so. </sentence><sentence id="309">It was pretty battered up and we took that. </sentence><sentence id="310">And so we were traveling very light and we were using the fur coat pretty much as a blanket or a <span class="spatial object">mattress</span> or whatever we needed to use it for. </sentence><sentence id="311">And, we left. </sentence><sentence id="312">During the ____ out of <span class="country">Belgium</span> and I guess the ____ also rode into <span class="country">France</span> and ____ I was bringing movies to sort of back up some of my stories as the French movie which was made oh, maybe in the 1940s or early 1950s called "Forbidden Games" I don't know if you're familiar with that. </sentence><sentence id="313">Anyway, it is a magnificent movie but one of the things that it shows it is about a girl whose parents are in one of these <span class="dlf">lines</span> and she escapes dying after she runs after her little dog. </sentence><sentence id="314">But it shows very, very clearly this thousands if not hundreds of thousands of people in a <span class="dlf">line</span> just moving down a <span class="dlf">road</span>. </sentence><sentence id="315">And some of them are on foot and some of them are on <span class="spatial object">bicycles</span> and of course some of them are in <span class="spatial object">cars</span>. </sentence><sentence id="316">But of course there is no gasoline as the ones in <span class="spatial object">cars</span> go so far. </sentence><sentence id="317">And the, the ones in <span class="spatial object">cars</span> get abandoned and the <span class="dlf">streets</span> the <span class="dlf">roads</span> are ____ with <span class="spatial object">cars</span>. </sentence><sentence id="318">And maybe every two or three minutes begins and so people dodge for cover and they dive into the <span class="dlf">ditches</span> and the sides of the <span class="dlf">roads</span>. </sentence><sentence id="319">And sometimes the people get up and sometimes they don't because a  certain amount of are successful and people are just down dead. </sentence><sentence id="320">So it is just an unbelievable sight you know. </sentence><sentence id="321">And this went on for a long time, it went on for about two days, I guess. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="353">Q: Who wete all these people ze </sentence></p></dialogue>

<span class="spatial object">stone bench</span> built inside to the side of the <span class="interior space">cell</span> and the <span class="dlf">door</span> or whatever and I think that in my father's <span class="interior space">cell</span> there was nine men with a place for three men to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="805">So they took turns, you know. </sentence><sentence id="806">And my dad tells me that one of the men who was a political -- I'm sorry who was a political man, a wonderful, wonderful story teller. </sentence><sentence id="807">And I know that one of the other men was a political prisoner who -- a Jew, a French Jew who joined the <span class="building">French underground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="808">He's a psychiatrist who been caught and sent to which was the terrible <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> in <span class="country">Spain</span>. </sentence><sentence id="809">And he had been taken out of <span class="populated

stayed there until the end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="811">At which point my parents found him quite accidentally in <span class="populated place">Montreal</span> (ph) and he came to stay with us for a couple of months. </sentence><sentence id="812">And he was still practicing psychiatry, he was almost ninety years old. </sentence><sentence id="813">Years ago, child psychiatry at that. </sentence><sentence id="814">Obviously, something is wrong somewhere there, I think. </sentence><sentence id="815">Well, I don't think should be practicing child psychiatry -- anyway, there was this highway man, and this psychiatrist and my father with a PhD in chemistry and I'm sure that there were some ordinary and I mean interesting criminals there as well. </sentence><sentence id="816">And I know that there was one Spanish Jew, because my father kept in touch with him for many, many years. </sentence><sentence id="817">He was a middle class person. </sentence><sentence id="818">So -- well, the <span class="building">women's jail</span> was far less interesting in the people that were there. </sentence><sentence id="819">There was the great majority of them were petty thieves and

didn't, I didn't stay with her at all. </sentence><sentence id="823">I was in a <span class="building">jail</span>, a <span class="building">precinct jail</span>. </sentence><sentence id="824">When these people came by their name was Hartock (ph) and they had been given my name by the joint. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="825">And they had no children and they wanted to take care of me and look after me. </sentence><sentence id="826">They wanted to take cate of me and they were a Swiss-German family, and they had a dog and they were very nice. </sentence><sentence id="827">They loved their dog and like I say, they had no children. </sentence><sentence id="828">And, I had just been through several years with no food on the <span class="spatial object">table</span> and I was very perturbed by that situation. </sentence><sentence id="829">I was very perturbed by the fact that they were Germans and I tried to set fire to their <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="830">And I drowned their <span class="building">house</span> and I tried to kill the dog. </sentence><sentence id="831">I was just doing the best after the war you have to understand, I mean we had things so good after all these things. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="832">And they were wonderful, they put up with me. </sentence><sentence id="833">They weren't very understanding because they put me in a <span class="building">private school</span> and they put me in a <span class="building">Swiss-Deutsch school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="834">You know, instead of letting me go to the <span class="building">local school</span> and learn some Spanish. </sentence><sentence id="835">So things did not go too well. </sentence><sentence id="836">I stayed with them for two or three months until my parents got out of <span class="building">jail</span> and my mother got out of <span class="building">jail</span>. </sentence><sentence id="837"> 3 End of

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1050">A: They put everybody that they could into <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>, in <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1051">Most the <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span> that they put people in were either too full or too far away. </sentence><sentence id="1052">So what they did, and I think a lot of people don't realize that, is they invented <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1053">And the places, the two places they sent us afterwards, I forget, was an invented <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1054">They didn't have the horror of a place like . </sentence><sentence id="1055">Plus there are these three levels of <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1056">There were the ones that we never experienced were the <span class="populated place">death camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1057">Then there were the ones that I never experienced which was the and I guess to some degree the <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span> in <span class="country">Germany</span> and <span class="country">Poland</span> were like that too. </sentence><sentence id="1058">They weren't <span class="populated place">death camps</span> because you weren't killed there, but you died there. </sentence><sentence id="1059">You died of starvation and mostly you died of disease. </sentence><sentence id="1060">Because you can deal with starvation to some extent, better than to deal with disease. </sentence><sentence id="1061">And then there was the third kind which were like the ones that we were in. </sentence><sentence id="1062">Where if you could manage somehow to get a little bit of freedom and to deal with the people in the <span class="populated place">town</span>, you manage to survive. </sentence><sentence id="1063">And then you were put under <span class="populated place">village</span> arrest sometimes and <span class="building">house</span> arrest other times. </sentence><sentence id="1064">If you were put under <span class="populated place">village</span> arrest, that was really good. </sentence><sentence id="1065">If you were put under house arrest, that was pretty bad. </sentence><sentence id="1066">Now since most of the people found their way to these <span class="populated place">camps</span> -- for Eastern European Jews, who  7 had moved to the <span class="region">South of France</span> warmed there way, but still didn't speak French -- we did. </sentence><sentence id="1067">We were accepted by everybody, everywhere that we went as being French speakers. </sentence><sentence id="1068">I told you about that woman that I met who asked me, was I for Jews or Belgians. </sentence><sentence id="1069">We were for Belgians, we were one of them. </sentence><sentence id="1070">And so it was very different and I could go to <span class="building">school</span> and make friends with my teachers and make friends with my <span class="building">school</span> mates. </sentence><sentence id="1071">We read the books and we get benefits of going to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1072">So my life was normal and then just totally disrupted. </sentence><sentence id="1073">Was totally different, but at least there was a <span class="building">base</span>, a connection in my life. </sentence><sentence id="1074">I never felt unconnected. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1100">Q: you talk about being a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>, I'm trying to understand about how it was set up? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1104">Q: Also, so I don't interrupt you again, what's the difference for you between <span class="building">house</span> and <span class="populated place">village</span> arrest? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1106">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="1107"><span class="building">House</span> arrest under which I found myself in for a very short time, you had to stay in your <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1108">You were really -- and the <span class="populated place">villages</span> were very small. </sentence><sentence id="1109">We are talking about a <span class="populated place">village</span> here where a large <span class="populated place">village</span> is maybe a 150 people. </sentence><sentence id="1110">I mean 500 people is a large <span class="populated place">village</span> and a 150 is pretty normal. </sentence><sentence id="1111">You're talking about a <span class="populated place">village</span> where -- which is very, very primitive. </sentence><sentence id="1112">I mean some people have privies and not have to go out and use the <span class="dlf">fields</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1113">You're talking about people where some people have and some people have to stand behind the <span class="spatial object">plow</span> themselves plowing the <span class="dlf">field</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1114">You know when we get into the <span class="populated place">town</span> that I went to in 1953, I was just 20. </sentence><sentence id="1115">And they had just put in <span class="env feature">running water</span> the year before and they were talking about now electricity. </sentence><sentence id="1116">And you're talking about a <span class="populated place">town</span> -- I mean it was 15 kilometers on one side, the fourth largest <span class="populated place">city</span> in the <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1117">You're talking about very, very primitive stuff here. </sentence><sentence id="1118">So when your under house arrest in a place like that, you're going to go crazy. </sentence><sentence id="1119">That is like being in <span class="building">jail</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1120">And the people who would oversee this <span class="building">house</span> arrest were Germans because there were German patrols, very few of them. </sentence><sentence id="1121">Which, had been installed in the <span class="populated place">villages</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1122">I keep saying <span class="populated place">towns</span>, but <span class="populated place">villages</span> is such a strange word to use in the <span class="country">United States</span>, but I always mean <span class="populated place">village</span> when I say <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1123">These people were the ones that were supervising us, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1124">And I don't know what the penalty was for breaking the law, but I imagine that it would be very severe. </sentence><sentence id="1125">Like instant removal to a real <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1126">Now I say here <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> but there weren't <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>, they were holding places. </sentence><sentence id="1127">That is what they were, holding <span class="spatial object">tanks</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
