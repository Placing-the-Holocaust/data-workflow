<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4">Q: Good morning. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6">A: Good morning, Joan. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="8">Q: Can you tell us your name and the name that you were born with, because I know it is different than your name now, and when you were born and where? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="10">A: I was born September 17, 1916, in <span class="populated place">Hannover</span>, <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="11">My name at that time was Bernard Fuchs, and I was born and raised in <span class="populated place">Hannover</span>; and until 1936, I went through the <span class="building">schools</span> and read the Nuremberg law, and it became too hard for us. </sentence><sentence id="12">I had to leave the <span class="building">university</span> because no Jews could study further. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="16">Q: Let's go back a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="17">Tell me about your family -- about your mother and your father and sister. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="20">A: My father and mother both came from <span class="populated place">Ledz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="21">They had left <span class="country">Poland</span> around when the war broke out, 1914 -- no before that -- 1913, they went to <span class="populated place">Elsass-Lothringen</span>, which is part of <span class="country">France</span> now and was at that time also. </sentence><sentence id="22">And there they lived until 1915 when they went to live in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="23">Father was a custom tailor, and he built up his own <span class="interior space">studio</span> and built up a wonderful clientele. </sentence><sentence id="24">He was really the number-one custom tailor in <span class="populated place">Hannover</span>. </sentence><sentence id="25">And my mother, may she rest in peace, died very young. </sentence><sentence id="26">She died already 1928, when I was 12 years old and is buried in <span class="populated place">Hannover</span>. </sentence><sentence id="27">My father remarried in 1932 and had another son in 1933 and -- when I had to leave the <span class="building">university</span>, I went on hash'alah" to be processed to go at that time <span class="country">Palestine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="28">But my father got sick. </sentence><sentence id="29">He had a very serious operation, and he asked me to stay back and take care of his wife and son. </sentence><sentence id="30">So, this way, that is why I did not go to <span class="country">Palestine</span> at that time. </sentence><sentence id="31">Then in 1938, there was a big Aktion" by the Germans where they took all foreigners, that means stateless or not, of German nationality -- Jews -- and collected them all in a <span class="building">concert hall</span> in <span class="populated place">Hannover</span>, and -- where we stayed for a day and a night. </sentence><sentence id="32">And then they took us in <span class="spatial object">cattle trains</span> to the <span class="dlf">Polish border</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="46">Q: I'd like to go back. </sentence><sentence id="47">It must have been very difficult when your mother passed away at such a young age for you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="50">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="52">Q: And when your father remarried, I gather you didn't stay at <span class="building">home</span> after that happened? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="54">"Tt is unclear what the interviewee said, however, it sounds as if he said "hash'alah." </sentence><sentence id="55">The figurative meaning of "hash'alah" is "on loan" (Hebrew). </sentence></p><p><sentence id="56"> ? </sentence><sentence id="57">Any nonmilitary campaign with political, racial, or eugenic ends (German). </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="58">A: No, I left <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="59">And -- I could not stay at that time. </sentence><sentence id="60">I just couldn't live with her. </sentence><sentence id="61">It became impossible. </sentence><sentence id="62">So, I had left when I was 14. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="68">Q: And you lived alone? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="70">A: I lived alone, yes. </sentence><sentence id="71">I lived with friends, with their parents. </sentence><sentence id="72">I rented a <span class="interior space">room</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="73">And I earned money, and at that time I paid the rent there and lived until the Aktion started. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="78">Q: But you remained close with your father and sister? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="80">A: Well, I had to, yes. </sentence><sentence id="81">My sister got engaged to be married with a -- not a Jewish man -- but we liked him. </sentence><sentence id="82">He was a very nice man. </sentence><sentence id="83">He was a <span class="building">dress manufacturer</span>, special designed dresses. </sentence><sentence id="84">And so how far back do you want me to go now? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="85">A: You can certainly talk about this, sure. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="87">Q: And when the Aktion started, as I mentioned, we were sent to <span class="country">Poland</span>, and when we came to the <span class="dlf">Polish border</span>, on one side we had the SS with the bayonets pointed at us, and on the other side we had the Polish with bayonets pointed at us, and we were in <span class="region">no-man's land</span> for 48 hours before some intervention the Poles opened the <span class="dlf">border</span> and let us into a very small <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="88">The name is <span class="populated place">Zbaszyn</span>. </sentence><sentence id="89">There -- I was always an organizer -- so when we went there, there was no <span class="building">housing</span> because it was a small <span class="populated place">village</span> and here we were about 2,000 people. </sentence><sentence id="90">So we organized. </sentence><sentence id="91">I took a few young people and we put handkerchiefs around our arms, our sleeves, and then we went and cleaned out pig sties where the cattle was and also some <span class="building">housing</span> which were empty. </sentence><sentence id="92">So, there we took care of the old people and the sick people and the children; some children were born right there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="99">And we were in <span class="populated place">Zbaszyn</span> until six weeks before the war broke out. </sentence><sentence id="100">In the meantime, a lot of people who had family in <span class="country">Poland</span> were released and they went to their people, and so my father also went back to <span class="populated place">Lodz</span> because he had two brothers living there with their families and I stayed until the last 100 were liquidated in <span class="populated place">Zbaszyn</span> because it was just about six weeks before the war started. </sentence><sentence id="101">Then I went to <span class="populated place">Krakow</span> with -- myself with some people that I had befriended and then later to <span class="populated place">Czestochowa</span>. </sentence><sentence id="102">In <span class="populated place">Czestochowa</span>, I stayed until I think it was September 1940. </sentence><sentence id="103">The <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> in <span class="populated place">Lodz</span> had already been closed the first of May. </sentence><sentence id="104">So, one evening a <span class="spatial object">car</span> came with a man named David Gertler, and he came in where I lived in <span class="populated place">Czestochowa</span>, because I had corresponded with my sister in <span class="populated place">Lodz</span>, so she knows where I was. </sentence><sentence id="105">And she had sent this man with an SS man in a private <span class="spatial object">car</span> to pick me up in <span class="populated place">Czestochowa</span> and took me into the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> to be reunited with my sister and father. </sentence><sentence id="106"> I was not too long in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, just a few days, when I got a call from Rumkowski," an Elder of the Jews, for a long interview. </sentence><sentence id="107">And there he said, "I want you to take over the <span class="building">labor department</span> because we have to register every Jew, every child in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> because we have to give them work." </sentence><sentence id="108">For work we will get bread and we can live. </sentence><sentence id="109">So we registered -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="121">Q: Let me ask you something. </sentence><sentence id="122">You're how old at this time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="125">A: At that time I was 24 years old. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="127">Q: What was your sister -- your sister's name is? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="129">A: <span class="building">Dora</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="131">Q: What was she doing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="133">A: She was the executive secretary of the <span class="building">Rumkowski</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="135">Q: Did you know this when you were writing to her? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="137">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="138">I knew it only when I came to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="141">Q: Was it surprising to you that she sent an SS man to get you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="143">A: Yes, only then I realized why she could have done it because of her position. </sentence><sentence id="144">She was able to do that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="147">Q: Did it worry you when these people came to the <span class="dlf">door</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="149">A: At first, yes, at first. </sentence><sentence id="150">But immediately when he told me who he is and what he came for, naturally I was relieved, and naturally I went with them to be reunited with my family. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="153">Q: When you saw your family at first, did your sister explain to you about Rumkowski and tell you things about him so that when you met him you had some idea? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="155">A: No, she just told me of what is going on and what has to be done because Rumkowski was in a position to deal with the <span class="building">Ghettoverwaltung</span>,* to tell them you give us material. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="156">We will manufacture it and in turn you give us food and whatever we need. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="157">&gt; Mordechai Chaim Rumkowski (1877-1944); Chairman of the <span class="building">Judenrat</span> in the <span class="populated place">Lodz ghetto</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="158">* "<span class="building">Ghetto Administration</span>" which also oversaw the activities of the <span class="building">Judenrat</span> (German). </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="159">Q: Let me ask you something in terms of reflecting back a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="160">When you were in <span class="populated place">Hannover</span> and the Nazis took over, you were in some sense fighting the Nazis, right? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="161">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="163">Q: You remember the Maccabees? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="165">A: Correct. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="167">Q: Can you explain what that organization was? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="169">A: It was an underground organization of students who, like me, had to leave the <span class="building">universities</span>, and we decided to make sabotage. </sentence><sentence id="170">We became, like in other words, terrorists and we got hold of explosives and we broke up -- we bombed their <span class="spatial object">trains</span>, any transport of the SS people and stuff like this. </sentence><sentence id="171">So, we really gave them a hard time. </sentence><sentence id="172">And in 1936, I was arrested for the first time by the Gestapo for three weeks, interrogated every day, the same questions asked, but they could not have any proof or couldn't tell anything of what I had done, so they had to let me go. </sentence><sentence id="173">That was in 1936. </sentence><sentence id="174">Then in "38, I mentioned to you already, I was sent to <span class="populated place">Zbaszyn</span> in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="181">Q: So, when you got to <span class="populated place">Lodz</span>, what did you think the Germans were doing in the course of the war to these Jews, since you had already experienced the Nuremberg laws and kicked out of the <span class="building">university</span>, and at least some violence against the Jews? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="183">A: Absolutely, yes. </sentence><sentence id="184">When I came to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, and I was told and I saw with my own eyes, of how the people have to live in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, and naturally I was right up in arms. </sentence><sentence id="185">I could not digest it that easily. </sentence><sentence id="186">And when the Elders of the Jews called on me to head the department, and naturally I was pleased that I got to do something productive for the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, even though people today have said I worked with the Germans and helped them, which is naturally it's nonsense because if we would not have done what we did in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, in 1942, that <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> would have been liquidated completely and no one would have survived. </sentence><sentence id="187">And thanks to Rumkowski, and thanks to his negotiation power he was able to convince the Germans, and actually the <span class="populated place">Lodz ghetto</span> became a model for all the <span class="populated place">ghettos</span> in the other <span class="region">areas</span>. </sentence><sentence id="188">So, three days and three nights we registered all the people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="195">Q: How did you do that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="197">A: Well, I got a staff and I got an <span class="building">office</span> and people came day and night. </sentence><sentence id="198">There were hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people, and we were able to do it in three days and three nights and everybody who registered also got where to go, to what <span class="building">factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="199">So we delegated people directly into the various <span class="building">factories</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="200">Q: So, Rumkowski sees you and tells you to head -- did you head this department by yourself at that point? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="201">A: At that point, yes, I organized it myself. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="203">Q: So, how long did it take you to figure out this organization after he had spoken to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="205">A: Well, I was given people to interview and I interviewed the people and whomever felt they could do the job I would tell them, yes, they were hired. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="207">Q: So how many people were on your staff at that point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="209">A: At that time I couldn't tell you exactly. </sentence><sentence id="210">It was over 20. </sentence><sentence id="211">Between 20 and 30 people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="215">Q: Now, when you registered, did you have cards printed out so you could register people? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="217">A: Yes, we had books and later on we made big index cards. </sentence><sentence id="218">But people themselves, they got a piece of paper with where to go, where to report to, to what <span class="building">factory</span>, and with this they were given i.d. </sentence><sentence id="219">cards and cards to be able to get food, like food stamps, coupons for food. </sentence><sentence id="220">And this entitled them to a soup. </sentence><sentence id="221">There were various soups around the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> where the people who worked the <span class="building">factories</span> were able to get a soup. </sentence><sentence id="222">Some a little bit heavier, some a little bit lighter soups, as you can imagine. </sentence><sentence id="223">And as the time passed, I had, for instance, I took a very sick-looking person out of a <span class="building">factory</span> and delegated him to a <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> while I took a healthy- looking guy from the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> and put him into the <span class="building">factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="224">So, with one signature of mine I made a friend and an enemy, which you can understand. </sentence><sentence id="225">The ones who worked in the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>, they were sitting. </sentence><sentence id="226">They got a little bit more to eat than the others. </sentence><sentence id="227">So, this went on, then, until 1944 -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="239">Q: Now you're moving too fast. </sentence><sentence id="240">When you're registering people, there are clearly some elderly people and there are kids who probably can't work. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="243">A: They still got cards. </sentence><sentence id="244">They still were registered. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="247">Q: And did they go with family members to certain <span class="building">factories</span> or would they stay in an <span class="interior space">apartment</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="249">A: They would register but they would not actually work because they couldn't work. </sentence><sentence id="250">They were unable to work, but if we would have left them without registration, without i.d.cards, they would die for hunger because they wouldn't get any rations. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="254">Q: So, everybody is registered whether they are really working or not. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="255">A: Yes, everybody had to be registered. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="256">Q: And when you came into the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and you're registering there are almost 200,000 people, right? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="258">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="260">Q: What is happening with <span class="building">housing</span> at this point? </sentence><sentence id="261">When you came in was everybody living where they're supposed to be living or are they moving around? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="264">A: Well, they had since the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was closed the first of May. </sentence><sentence id="265">Naturally, all these people coming from the other side of the <span class="populated place">town</span> into the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> had to be housed. </sentence><sentence id="266">So, naturally, there wasn't enough <span class="building">housing</span> available for every family. </sentence><sentence id="267">So you found in most cases that in one <span class="interior space">room</span> lived four families. </sentence><sentence id="268">In every corner a different family, OK, and the conditions naturally were unbearable to live, really, because there was no running water. </sentence><sentence id="269">There were no <span class="spatial object">toilets</span> in the <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="270">People didn't have <span class="interior space">bathrooms</span>. </sentence><sentence id="271">They would have to go to <span class="building">outhouses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="272">And they would have to go and pump the water from a <span class="spatial object">pump</span> and bring it up into the <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="273">So, the conditions naturally as you can imagine was anything but human. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="284">Q: And were there a number of <span class="spatial object">pumps</span> in different parts of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="286">A: No, mostly in every <span class="building">house</span> they had some water supply, but it was like I said: no <span class="interior space">bathroom</span> and not every <span class="building">house</span> had running water. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="288">Q: Were you living with your father and your sister? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="290">A: Yes, in the beginning. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="292">Q: I gather that your father's second wife and child had left? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="294">A: No, she had left in 1939 to <span class="country">England</span>. </sentence><sentence id="295">She was a nurse by profession and she got a job in <span class="country">England</span> as a nurse, so she took off with her son and went to <span class="country">England</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="298">Q: And had your father wanted to go and they didn't allow him to, or you don't know? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="300">A: She didn't get any papers for him. </sentence><sentence id="301">She got papers just for herself and her son, and father was very active in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> also being a custom tailor. </sentence><sentence id="302">He was always working and had also quite a few tailors working together and they made for these people, even for the people in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="303">He had to make their suits for them, right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="304">Q: Once this big registration happened, with all these people, and all of the people are going to their particular <span class="building">factories</span> or <span class="building">work places</span>, what is then your job? </sentence><sentence id="305">What are your responsibilities once that happened? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="306">A: Well -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="308">Q: What would be a day? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="310">A: They were always going movements on. </sentence><sentence id="311">People had died from hunger. </sentence><sentence id="312">They had to be replaced. </sentence><sentence id="313">OK, so, there was always a lot of switching of personnel because you can imagine so many people and so many various <span class="building">factories</span>, so there was always something going on where the department of labor had to act accordingly, right. </sentence><sentence id="314">So, there was always something going on that kept us busy. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="320">Q: Were you meeting with Rumkowski regularly? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="322">A: Not regularly but often. </sentence><sentence id="323">He came to my <span class="building">office</span> or I was called upon for meetings. </sentence><sentence id="324">And -- oh, yes, frequently I saw <span class="building">Rumkowski</span>, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="328">Q: What was your relationship like? </sentence><sentence id="329">What kinds of things would you discuss? </sentence><sentence id="330">Would it only be business or were you also discussing the situation? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="334">A: Well, if we were socially somewhere together, then yes, I would talk with him a little bit about various subjects and incidents which occurred which I wanted to know more details about. </sentence><sentence id="335">And also, about my background, what he wanted to know. </sentence><sentence id="336">But otherwise, he was very busy and there wasn't much time for socializing, except when we had concerts. </sentence><sentence id="337">We had our own orchestra, and so it was really a <span class="populated place">city</span> by itself in itself. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="342">Q: Was this a hard job for you? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="712">A: Well, I would say that some of them who were affected by the newcomers, as you want to call them, because they had to share a <span class="interior space">room</span> with them or whatever, so naturally they might take objection to it. </sentence><sentence id="713">But in general, everybody tried to help, actually, the other. </sentence><sentence id="714"> 5 </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1186">A: I think that my sister had many sleepless nights because she saw and knew more than anybody else what was going on inside and outside the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1187">And one time I remember they took Rumkowski outside the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and he didn't come back until the next day, so we had feared for the worst. </sentence><sentence id="1188">But he came back and nobody every spoke of what had happened. </sentence><sentence id="1189">Nobody even tried to guess of why he was taken away and why he was brought back. </sentence><sentence id="1190">In my eyes, he was not the despot, the demigod, as people made him or said he was, because as I mention to anybody I talk if not Rumkowski, no matter what he did, the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> would have liquidated in 1942, completely, without any resistance, without anybody I believe, without me being alive today. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1196">Q: Do you think Dora knew what had happened when he left and didn't come back overnight, your sister? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1198">A: She might have. </sentence><sentence id="1199">She never answered the question because that's another thing that people wanted to know, of what transpired. </sentence><sentence id="1200">She would completely ignore the question, so I don't know if she knew or she didn't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1204">Q: Do you think she ever wanted to resign? </sentence><sentence id="1205">Did she ever talk to you because she was so close to all of this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1208">A: No, no. </sentence><sentence id="1209">She was so much involved that she never spoke with me about whether to resign or not to resign. </sentence><sentence id="1210">She had three girls working with her in the <span class="building">executive office</span> and she worked there very, very hard, I know, long hours, and I'm sure it was nerve-racking for her, but she was quite a character. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1214">Q: Can you describe her? </sentence><sentence id="1215"> 4 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1218">A: How shall I describe her? </sentence><sentence id="1219">Very bright, extremely intelligent, quick to the draw, down to <span class="env feature">earth</span>, and a tremendous inside view of what is happening -- all the surroundings of her. </sentence><sentence id="1220">She was quite a woman. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1224">Q: So you were close to each other? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1232">Q: Was she married in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> or was she single? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1234">A: No, they married after the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1235">She married the brother of the second in command of Eric Yakobovitch. </sentence><sentence id="1236">He was the vice president, if I can say so, and he was in charge of all the <span class="building">factories</span> and he was a second in command. </sentence><sentence id="1237">So, when Rumkowski was unable to do something, he was the one to enforce everything. </sentence><sentence id="1238">He was the one to do it, and his brother married my sister after the war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1244">Q: Did she ever say what it was like to work with Rumkowski? </sentence><sentence id="1245">Was he easy to work with or difficult to work with? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1248">A: We knew it was difficult to work for him. </sentence><sentence id="1249">She didn't have to answer that because everybody knew it was a horrible job for anybody because as I said, he really took everything out of you especially when you were that close like she was to him. </sentence><sentence id="1250">He was demanding. </sentence><sentence id="1251">He was demanding, and he wanted you to do something you better do it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1256">Q: Was he like this before? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1258">A: I didn't know him before, but I know that he was a very charitable man and was always going around fundraising for his <span class="building">orphanage</span> which was very close to him. </sentence><sentence id="1259">I was told, because I did not know him, naturally, from before. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1262">Q: It seems to me that the picture of any human being is very complicated, so someone damning a person or completely praising someone may not be quite appropriate. </sentence><sentence id="1263">Do you think there was anything negative -- I mean you've said very powerful things about him in terms of what you think he was able to do that wouldn't have happened without him. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1266">Do you think anything negatively about him? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1267">A: Well, one thing is he lost his temper very easily... and then watch out. </sentence><sentence id="1268">That's what I can say about him, and you had to do what he wanted. </sentence><sentence id="1269">And very, very seldom did I do against  5 what he said. </sentence><sentence id="1270">If he said A and I wanted B, I went B. I was a hothead too, you know, but it never came really to a fight or something with him. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1275">Q: So, you controlled yourself in spite of your rage? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1277">A: I did, I did. </sentence><sentence id="1278">Today I can say, yes, I controlled myself, but he was redheaded -- a hot guy. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1281">Q: But he also had power, so that -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1283">A: Tremendous power. </sentence><sentence id="1284">He had absolute control of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1285">He was the man. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1289">Q: So, that if he, if you went against him, he could get you deported? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1291">A: Oh, absolutely, absolutely. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1293">Q: That's a bit frightening to be around. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1295">A: Well, you lived with either or. </sentence><sentence id="1296">You could have had the same thing from the Germans because if they didn't like something they could have done the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="1297">So it was not an easy situation all around. </sentence><sentence id="1298">All right? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1303">Q: Do you think that these workers who had demonstrated these early mass demonstrations, many of them were sent in the early deportations? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1305">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1307">Q: Possibly because they had gone on strike? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1309">A: Probably. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1311">Q: Had -- and probably Rumkowski wanted them out because they were trouble in terms of what he was trying to do. </sentence><sentence id="1312">Do you think they might have been the core of resistance or is that just a stupid idea? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1315">A: Well, as I said, they tried to better themselves. </sentence><sentence id="1316">They tried to get more food and they did not realize by the same token you have today's strikes which absolutely nonsense because what do they achieve? </sentence><sentence id="1317">At that time it was even more ridiculous but they didn't realize that. </sentence><sentence id="1318">They just tried and mobilize themselves and tried to better their condition. </sentence><sentence id="1319">But naturally it was in vain because what could they do? </sentence><sentence id="1320">What could Rumkowski have done? </sentence><sentence id="1321">Just because they demonstrated, he could not go to the Germans and say I want more food for my people, all right, and whatever we had we had to work for. </sentence><sentence id="1322">So even  6 when I was interviewed by Ross (ph), at his interview with me, he said how do I feel today that I cooperated with the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1323">I didn't cooperate with the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1324">Just because we manufactured something the Germans could use, well, that was our livelihood. </sentence><sentence id="1325">That was our bread. </sentence><sentence id="1326">And a lot of people don't understand that. </sentence><sentence id="1327">Okay, we made munitions parts. </sentence><sentence id="1328">Okay we made something the German army could use, but did we have another choice? </sentence><sentence id="1329">It was our work and our labor which saved us from complete starvation. </sentence><sentence id="1330">What little we got but we got it because we worked for it, so there was no cooperation, you know, with the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1331">So that is a misunderstanding which still goes around in a lot of people. </sentence><sentence id="1332">But they don't think. </sentence><sentence id="1333">They just go with the masses. </sentence><sentence id="1334">Why? </sentence><sentence id="1335">Can you imagine that after the all documentation you see in public television and whatever, the Holocaust - - the American army when they went into these <span class="populated place">camps</span> and made all these films of what they found and still people today can say denying that there was such a thing, that it is all propaganda. </sentence><sentence id="1336">For what propaganda? </sentence><sentence id="1337">Who won the war? </sentence><sentence id="1338">The Germans and the Japanese. </sentence><sentence id="1339">They didn't lose the war, they won it. </sentence><sentence id="1340">The Marshall Plan lift them up until they are one of the biggest <span class="country">nations</span> of the world. </sentence><sentence id="1341">Am I right or wrong? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1369">Q: Do you think that was a bad idea? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1371">A: I don't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1373">Q: Can you talk about the last few months when you think about 30,000 or 40,000 people left in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> before the last deportations or are there more than that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1375">A: Well, it all depends on what timeframe are we talking. </sentence><sentence id="1376">We're talking 1944. </sentence><sentence id="1377">We're talking about the timeframe between January or February "44 to September, October. </sentence><sentence id="1378">There might have been about 60,000 or 70,000 people left, and all the <span class="spatial object">transports</span> took place at that timeframe. </sentence><sentence id="1379">We were taking into the <span class="building">hospital</span> and we stayed there to be transported out of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1380">A few days before Rumkowski and Rosenblat (ph), you know, the police chief and his brother and a lot of other dignitaries went with the <span class="spatial object">transport</span> to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1381">We however, went, as I mentioned, to <span class="populated place">Sachsenhausen</span> and then wound up in <span class="populated place">Koenigswusterhausen</span> in that <span class="building">factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1382">And only about 800 people were left to liquidate the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and they came out smelling like a rose because they found all these treasures which were left behind in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1383">So, they came out fairly well-off and today they are all set. </sentence><sentence id="1384">More power to them because better them than the Germans. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1395">Q: So there's a group that's left to liquidate, to tidy up everything? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1413">Q: All of you were together? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1415">A: We were separated. </sentence><sentence id="1416">We went to <span class="populated place">Sachsenhausen</span> and they went to <span class="populated place">Ravensbriick</span>, and then very late, it must have been, we were liberated on the 27th of April in "45 so that must have been in the beginning of "45 where a <span class="spatial object">transport</span> of women were sent where we were into another <span class="building">barrack</span>, separated from us. </sentence><sentence id="1417">We had no contact and -- except when we went to labor, but I was in the <span class="building">factory</span>, so, but they worked outside with some men also. </sentence><sentence id="1418">So in the evening they were separated again. </sentence><sentence id="1419">And Eric Yakobovitch's son, who lives now in <span class="region">Florida</span>, he was at that time five years old or six years old and he came with his mother also. </sentence><sentence id="1420">But Irene and my sister, they did not come with that <span class="spatial object">transport</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1421">They were left in <span class="populated place">Ravensbrtick</span> and they were liberated by the Russians, as we were also, in April. </sentence><sentence id="1422">And just only maybe 50 or 60 women and children came where we were. </sentence><sentence id="1423">The rest were left, yes, and we were liberated the 27th of April 1945 at 4:00 in the morning the Russians came. </sentence><sentence id="1424">Before, I must tell you, a very bad thing happened. </sentence><sentence id="1425">We had also <span class="dlf">air raid trenches</span>, and every night the sirens, you know, they came during the night we were working and at day time they were bombing. </sentence><sentence id="1426">So every time there was an air raid we had assigned places in these <span class="dlf">trenches</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1427">The first few alarms I went with my father and we went to the place where we were supposed to be, but then I said, "Papa, we are not going anymore." </sentence><sentence id="1428">I was lying on the <span class="interior space">floor</span> under the <span class="spatial object">bunks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1429">On this end of the <span class="building">barrack</span> my father was on the other end of the <span class="building">barrack</span> and every time a bomb or grenade hit we called each other to make sure that we were okay because we had 66 shrapnel in our <span class="building">barrack</span>, and where we were supposed to be there were four young brothers. </sentence><sentence id="1430">They came originally from <span class="populated place">Pabianice</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1431">They were in our spot where we were and a grenade hit them full blast and all four were wiped out. </sentence><sentence id="1432">It would have happened to us if we would have been there. </sentence><sentence id="1433">That's fate. </sentence><sentence id="1434">That's fate and that's kismet. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1455">Q: Where was <span class="populated place">David</span>? </sentence><sentence id="1456"> 8 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1459">A: David, he was taken -- oh, yeah, one day towards the end I was sent to the outside commando and when we came back that late afternoon, 70 men had been taken away from the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, amongst them my father-in-law, may he rest in peace and my brother-in- law, may he rest in peace. </sentence><sentence id="1460">They were taken together with the others. </sentence><sentence id="1461">They were sent on a march by foot. </sentence><sentence id="1462">They were supposed to go up to the <span class="env feature">North Sea</span>, put on a <span class="spatial object">boat</span> and as a final solution being bombed out and drowned. </sentence><sentence id="1463">And my father-in-law, he was shot, after the war had ended already, the third of May. </sentence><sentence id="1464">He couldn't walk anymore and they shot him. </sentence><sentence id="1465">My brother-in-law was able to escape at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1466">So, that was the last few days. </sentence><sentence id="1467">And I had my violin. </sentence><sentence id="1468">That's all I took. </sentence><sentence id="1469">Of course I had a few hidden items there. </sentence><sentence id="1470">And I went with my father after the fourth or the fifth day after we were liberated because I said "Let's not go out because they're still shooting." </sentence><sentence id="1471">And I went with the Russian commando to organize bread and meat and wurst and whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1472">I warned people, "Don't overeat, take it easy," and sure enough a few people overate and got sick and blew themselves up. </sentence><sentence id="1473">And I went with father and we went across a <span class="dlf">field</span> and there was a <span class="spatial object">trunk</span> and it was covered with blood and I could open it and I opened it up and there were money, German money, the <span class="country">Reichsmark</span>, it must have been at least a million or more and I said to my father, "Papa, if this is here full of blood it's not worth anything because I feel that the Reichsmark will be nothing worth after the war and there will be new money." </sentence><sentence id="1474">If I would have known that until 1948 these Reichsmarks were good and valid, I would have been a millionaire at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1475">I could have bought whole <span class="dlf">blocks</span> of <span class="building">houses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1476">I didn't even touch it. </sentence><sentence id="1477">I didn't even touch one piece of paper money and I walked off with my fiddle. </sentence><sentence id="1478">I went over to the <span class="env feature">Elbe River</span> and there was a Russian commander and I wanted to go across the <span class="env feature">river</span> because the Americans were on the other side. </sentence><sentence id="1479">That's where I wanted to be. </sentence><sentence id="1480">I didn't want to be with the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="1481">So, I went to the commandant and asked him if I could go with the first <span class="spatial object">transport</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1482">They were French, French prisoners of war. </sentence><sentence id="1483">They were allowed to cross the <span class="env feature">Elbe River</span> the next morning and I went to the commandant and asked I would like to go with them. </sentence><sentence id="1484">So, I go back to my <span class="populated place">hometown</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1485">So he said, "You are a German, so you have to wait until the Germans can go." </sentence><sentence id="1486">So we smuggled, my father and I smuggled ourselves into the group of French people and we made it to the <span class="spatial object">ferry boat</span> and made it across the <span class="env feature">river</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1487">We went to the Americans. </sentence><sentence id="1488">I went to the commander there and I introduced ourselves -- what we are and where we are coming from -- and so he asked me a few questions, how is "father" in Hebrew, how is "mother" in Hebrew and, "What kind of brakhah"* do you say over this?" </sentence><sentence id="1489">And so I answered him so he knew that, yes, and since then the big love affair between them and us and they wanted to give us everything. </sentence><sentence id="1490">I had to help him. </sentence><sentence id="1491">I was as, as a, an interpreter for a few days until we could freely travel until everything was clear and before we would get the first papers to travel. </sentence><sentence id="1492">So, once I was very eager to go <span class="building">home</span> to my <span class="populated place">hometown</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1493">So the commander gave me a <span class="spatial object">jeep</span>, papers I could go everywhere to get gas. </sentence><sentence id="1494">They called it petrol at that time, and papers that I could travel and that I have uy blessing (Hebrew.) </sentence><sentence id="1495"> 9 legitimately this <span class="spatial object">jeep</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1496">And so, I started driving and everywhere I asked for my wife, whether somebody has seen my wife. </sentence><sentence id="1497">And nobody knew. </sentence><sentence id="1498">Nobody said anything. </sentence><sentence id="1499">Then I finally came to <span class="populated place">Hannover</span>, to my <span class="populated place">hometown</span>, and I started working right away in the <span class="building">town hall</span> and registered all the people who were coming from the various <span class="populated place">camps</span> and I repatriated people like Poles to <span class="country">Poland</span> and Czechs to Czech and I took them all with various <span class="dlf">passes</span> to the various <span class="populated place">border towns</span> and I left them there and I took the <span class="spatial object">buses</span> back <span class="building">home</span> because they were all from the <span class="building">post office</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1500">In <span class="country">Germany</span> all the <span

of my wife. </sentence><sentence id="1502">Then one girl, showed it to her, which she saw the picture of the <span class="spatial object">dolly</span> said Irene was bombed out. </sentence><sentence id="1503">She's not alive anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1504">And later on Irene told me that she was told that I was bombed out. </sentence><sentence id="1505">So, it took us ten months after the
