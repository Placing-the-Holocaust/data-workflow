<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1">Q: Will you just begin by telling me your name during the war and date of birth and where you were born? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3">A: Okay, well my name during the war was -- I had several names, but the name I was born to was Annaliza and I was born in <span class="populated place">Antwerp</span> <span class="country">Belgium</span> in December 1936. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5">Q: So you were very young at the time before the war. </sentence><sentence id="6">You probably don't have too much memory about what was happening prior to the war? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9">A: No, only very sporadic memories of my father and memories that perhaps are based on stories more than memories but I do think I have very clear pictures of going to the <span class="dlf">park</span> with my dad and playing with him and doing things that normally you would expect a boy to do with a father rather than a little girl and I thought that people usually ask me why I chose a profession that I chose and although my father was a very orthodox Jewish man and certainly would have never admitted to that feeling I think that I was his first born and I think he considered me in some ways his son. </sentence><sentence id="10">I remember the feeling of going to the <span class="dlf">park</span> and playing with him and him being perhaps more involved with a child, particularly a man of his generation than you'd expect him to be particularly with a girl. </sentence><sentence id="11">That's what I remember. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="15">Q: You had a comfortable family life? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="17">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="18">I remember having two dear little friends who lived with us in the same <span class="building">house</span>, and my grandfather and just pictures mostly not -- I remember I had a little friend who's exactly my age a few months older and his sister who was two years younger and we lived in the same <span class="building">house</span> and we were constantly fighting cats and dogs. </sentence><sentence id="19">We couldn't be without one another. </sentence><sentence id="20">So, we almost really always be together and I also remember that I didn't like dolls and I used to get dolls and I used to give them to my little girlfriend. </sentence><sentence id="21">She loved the dolls. </sentence><sentence id="22">That's what I remember. </sentence><sentence id="23">I remember being very comfortable. </sentence><sentence id="24">I'm sure we were not comfortable I mean financially but I had a very nice feeling about the family. </sentence><sentence id="25">I mean just my grandfather was a very sweet old man. </sentence><sentence id="26">He used to tell me stories. </sentence><sentence id="27">That's basically all I remember. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="39">Q: Now what kind of <span class="building">business</span> was your father in? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="41">A: I'm not sure. </sentence><sentence id="42">I think he started out delivering milk and learning how to be a diamond cutter or something of the sort. </sentence><sentence id="43">He was very, very religious. </sentence><sentence id="44">I remember that. </sentence><sentence id="45">He was always going to <span class="building">synagogue</span>, coming from <span class="building">synagogue</span> and praying an awful lot. </sentence><sentence id="46">In my head it seemed like too much. </sentence><sentence id="47">It seemed like not a very tense life. </sentence><sentence id="48">He was going to work and coming <span class="building">home</span> and we observed the Sabbath. </sentence><sentence id="49">We would always go for walks in the <span class="dlf">park</span> and things of that sort. </sentence><sentence id="50">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="51">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="52"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="65">Q: Did you have non-Jewish friends as well, or were you mostly in a <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="67">A: I was strictly <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span> before the war and to my knowledge, I don't think my parents knew anyone that wasn't Jewish except in an official capacity. </sentence><sentence id="68">I don't know, postman, policeman, -- no social interaction with non-Jews at all. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="71">Q: Your neighbors were Jewish as well? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="73">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="74">The ones I knew. </sentence><sentence id="75">I mean I was a kid so I don't remember everybody who lived there but I would say the majority were Jewish. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="79">Q: Now, your mother spoke of a lot anti-semitism in <span class="country">Belgium</span> before the war. </sentence><sentence id="80">Do you have any images of that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="83">A: The only one is a story that my mom told me and that sort of became an indication of my early rebellion and that was at some point during these --right either at the beginning of the war or the pre-war period my grandfather was beaten up on the way back from <span class="building">synagogue</span> or threatened or harassed and he I think people were pulling at his beard and he hid his beard in his coat. </sentence><sentence id="84">When he came <span class="building">home</span>, he looked really terrible and very upset and he had told me that this was a Friday night that Friday night when men used to go to the <span class="building">synagogue</span> they had a couple of angels who were watching over them and walking with them to and from <span class="building">synagogue</span>. </sentence><sentence id="85">So, when he came back beaten and so on, I asked him Grandfather where were your angels then. </sentence><sentence id="86">So, that picture remained with me, his frightened look and the statement that I made then, I don't remember having made it, but it fits with the way I think. </sentence><sentence id="87">So, and several people that I have met, in fact recently, very recently just about three months ago when I was last in <span class="country">Belgium</span> said you are this little girl who said that. </sentence><sentence id="88">They remember that statement. </sentence><sentence id="89">That's the only evidence I have of anti-semitism that touched us directly but before I really don't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="97">Q: Do you remember what your grandfather's response was to that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="99">A: I don't think he said anything. </sentence><sentence id="100">He didn't say anything. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="103">Q: Did you ever have to wear the <span class="spatial object">Star of David</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="105">A: Yes, I did. </sentence><sentence id="106">Both my mother and I wore it I think after the men, -- the husband of this neighbor and my dad were taken I think to go to a <span class="populated place">work camp</span>, and we had to wear the star. </sentence><sentence id="107">One picture I have of that is that she used to always carry me over her should to hide her star so that we would travel in the <span class="spatial object">trolley</span> or something and she would carry me so that her star and mine were essentially hidden to avoid being harassed in the <span class="dlf">streets</span>. </sentence><sentence id="108">She'd always do that, carry me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="113">Q: Do you remember, and I assume we'll be getting into things that I think you probably have a very clear memory of -- do you remember when <span class="country">Belgium</span> was occupied by <span class="country">Germany</span>? </sentence><sentence id="114">Do you remember seeing troops or hearing noise? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="117"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="118">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="119"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="120">A: I remember having to leave in the middle of the night and walking through <span class="env feature">woods</span> and being petrified and having German shepherds, hearing German shepherds barking in the distance and dragging and running through <span class="env feature">woods</span>. </sentence><sentence id="121">I remember that, so I remember the German voices and the dogs, particularly the dogs and until maybe ten years ago I had to run if I saw any dog or heard a dog. </sentence><sentence id="122">So, I've overcome that too, but I really was very shaken by a dog. </sentence><sentence id="123">I couldn't go in a <span class="interior space">room</span> -- and particularly a <span class="spatial object">German shepherd</span>, I would just freeze. </sentence><sentence id="124">I would completely decompensate so I remember that. </sentence><sentence id="125">I don't remember the <span class="dlf">streets</span> of <span class="country">Belgium</span> per se. </sentence><sentence id="126">I remember the terror of what appeared -- I saw my mother being frightened and I became completely petrified. </sentence><sentence id="127">I remember that march through the <span class="env feature">woods</span> and ending up in some abandoned <span class="building">home</span> somewhere and being there with a lot, a lot of people. </sentence><sentence id="128">I don't remember who these people were except for those friends that we were living with basically. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="138">Q: So you were running to hide from the Germans? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="140">A: Yes, we were running to try and escape because at some point after the two husbands had gone to work, during that period some people came into the <span class="building">house</span> and they weren't really Nazis, but they pretended to be Gestapo and they beat up everyone in the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="141">My mother and my grandfather and me and they were really beating us and I remember screaming and my mother screaming. </sentence><sentence id="142">They finally left. </sentence><sentence id="143">They ransacked the place and they were looking for money and so on. </sentence><sentence id="144">They got in on the pretense of being Gestapo and -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="150">Q: These were just Belgium police? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="152">A: Yes, they were just <span class="building">Belgium police</span> or Belgium hoodlums, not necessarily in any kind of official capacity. </sentence><sentence id="153">They might have just done that. </sentence><sentence id="154">This was a good time to do that. </sentence><sentence id="155">I mean it was perfectly acceptable. </sentence><sentence id="156">So, at that time my mother I think and her friend decided to leave and try to join the husbands and I think that this is when we went to <span class="country">France</span> with the idea of trying to get to <span class="country">Switzerland</span> because <span class="country">Switzerland</span> was a safe place. </sentence><sentence id="157">If I remember when we got to the <span class="dlf">rondeveax</span> essentially of where we were supposed to meet our fathers and someone to take us across the <span class="dlf">border</span>, someone had betrayed and so that's when my parents went to the <span class="populated place">camps</span>, the <span class="populated place">French camps</span> &gt;&gt; Was one of the <span class="populated place">camps</span> that they went to. </sentence><sentence id="158">I'm not exactly sure how we got out of there and they went to another <span class="populated place">camp</span> and that period my friends and I went to that <span class="building">home</span> that we were hidden in. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="166">Q: I just want to backtrack a second so I don't get confused. </sentence><sentence id="167">Now you had mentioned that your father and his friend your neighbor were sent to a <span class="populated place">work camp</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="170">A: In <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="172">Q: This was before you went out into hiding into the <span class="env feature">woods</span>? </sentence><sentence id="173">I'm trying to get the sequence here. </sentence><sentence id="174">If you remember, through researching any dates, maybe that would help me too. </sentence><sentence id="175">I mean that I know that you -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="180"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="181">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="182"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="183">A: I think the first time we left, because we left twice. </sentence><sentence id="184">The first time we might have gone all of us together to in <span class="country">France</span>, and that must have been "40, "41 somewhere around there. </sentence><sentence id="185">And then we came back to <span class="country">Belgium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="186">I think subsequently the men went to work again to that place in <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="191">Q: Which was called? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="193">A: or something like that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="195">Q: This was near I think? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="197">A: Yes, in the north of <span class="country">France</span> somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="198">And during the period that they were away that's when we had the incident of people breaking into our <span class="building">home</span> and then we left I think that's when we went through the <span class="env feature">woods</span> and were supposed to meet up with the fathers and then supposed to meet up with someone who was going to take us across the <span class="dlf">border</span> to <span class="country">Switzerland</span>, but we didn't make it. </sentence><sentence id="199">So, and we got caught that time. </sentence><sentence id="200">The first time we were simply sent back <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="201">The second time we got caught by the French police who then put us into these sort of <span class="populated place">transient camps</span> which are really deportation but I certainly didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="202">I don't know how much my parents knew of what these places were going to lead to. </sentence><sentence id="203">I'm not sure they really knew. </sentence><sentence id="204">At some point they heard that people who left there never got back. </sentence><sentence id="205">I mean that through the grapevine that sort of information started to filter through and so they found that out and that's when I was in the <span class="building">children's home</span> they were at a <span class="populated place">camp</span> and that's when they decided to run out of the <span class="populated place">camp</span> before they were sent to <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="215">Q: Now, as I understand it, the second <span class="populated place">camp</span> they went to was ? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="217">A: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="219">Q: Were you in that at all with them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="221">A: No, I think that when they were transferred to they had made some arrangements to take the children away and try to hide them, and that's when we were, my friends and I in that <span class="populated place">camp</span> in that <span class="building">home</span> near : </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="223">Q: Tell me a little bit about the <span class="building">home</span>, who was there, what was it like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="225">A: Well, the children ranged from about four of five years of age, somewhere around there until they looked very big to me, but actually they were 16. </sentence><sentence id="226">I think the oldest were 16 to 17. </sentence><sentence id="227">There was a mixture. </sentence><sentence id="228">They were all refugee children. </sentence><sentence id="229">Many of them were not Jewish and many were actually refugees from the Spanish civil war because this place was very close to <span class="country">Spain</span>. </sentence><sentence id="230">It's in the part of <span class="country">France</span> that borders on <span class="country">Spain</span> almost so the <span class="populated place">catholic archdiocese</span> of that <span class="region">area</span> had taken in some children from that war and kept all of them together in that <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="237">Q: So, this was a <span class="building">catholic home</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="254">A: Well, things that stand out hunger, real, real hunger. </sentence><sentence id="255">Nothing to eat, but that didn't bother me because I really didn't like to eat but I remember my little girlfriend, food was her thing. </sentence><sentence id="256">She was this plump little thing and you could always shut her up by giving her food. </sentence><sentence id="257">So, I used to run to the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> at night and steal whatever I could find and feed her because she was crying all night. </sentence><sentence id="258">She was crying because she was hungry, and I was crying because I wanted my mother. </sentence><sentence id="259">So, we were quite a pair. </sentence><sentence id="260">So, hunger -- and I knew there was nothing to eat and whatever there was I couldn't swallow. </sentence><sentence id="261">I just couldn't swallow any food there. </sentence><sentence id="262">The other thing I remember is lice and the worst incident which may look ridiculous now but was when you had lice they shaved your head, and I was very proud of my hair. </sentence><sentence id="263">I had really beautiful long hair and when I found out that I had lice and I could tell, because I was really itching. </sentence><sentence id="264">I hid in the <span class="building">outhouse</span>. </sentence><sentence id="265">There was no indoor plumbing. </sentence><sentence id="266">There was <span class="interior space">indoor</span> cold water to wash but no <span class="spatial object">toilet</span>. </sentence><sentence id="267">I hid in the <span class="building">outhouse</span> for a couple of days and nobody could get me out of there because I knew as soon as they found out they would shave my head. </sentence><sentence id="268">So, but they eventually did. </sentence><sentence id="269">I had to get out. </sentence><sentence id="270">They shaved my head, and it was absolutely horrible, just horrible. </sentence><sentence id="271">Now, it looks kind of silly but and it wasn't just lice it was scabies, you know the things that crawl under your skin, so we were not really in very good shape. </sentence><sentence id="272">And there was always a feeling of fear and just terrible -- feeling terrible. </sentence><sentence id="273">First of all, not understanding at all why you were there what was happening, missing your family and just the terror basically. </sentence><sentence id="274">I think I acted irrationally on many occasions where I would just run out of the <span class="dlf">window</span> in the middle of the night in the nightgown and just try to run away and being caught. </sentence><sentence id="275">You know, brought back to this, so we had songs but I don't know if they made them up or the older children probably did which referred to us having to wake up at 7:00 in the morning and having to wash with cold water and the son reflected that there was no food only some kind of vegetable, something like a sweet potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="276">That's why when people serve me sweet potato at Thanksgiving I say thanks but no thanks. </sentence><sentence id="277">I can't even look at the stuff. </sentence><sentence id="278">I don't know if it's the same, but it's so similar that it's enough to turn me off. </sentence><sentence id="279">That's all we had. </sentence><sentence id="280">SO, there was a song that reflected the realities of the time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="308">Q: What was a normal day like in this <span class="building">home</span>? </sentence><sentence id="309">What did you do? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="365">Q: How many kids were there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="367">A: I really don't know. </sentence><sentence id="368">I'd say 100 or so, not more than that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="371">Q: Were the people who took care of you nice? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="407">A: Well, the circumstances are a little bit muddled but apparently my parents send someone to pick us up from there because they were escaping to <span class="populated place">Nice</span> to the part of <span class="country">France</span> that was occupied by the Italians as to the Germans. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="409">Q: How did your parents get out of ? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="411">A: From what they told me is that they were told that they were going to be sent somewhere else and they sort of smelled a rat and they asked for one day off to come in and say goodbye to their children or visit their children and then of course they ran away to <span class="populated place">Nice</span> during that supposed trip, but they didn't come to pick us up because they were afraid. </sentence><sentence id="412">So, they apparently sent some lady to pick us up, but my friend whom I spoke to yesterday, said that this person was afraid to travel with three children, so she gave us the money and left and told us how to get there. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="473">Q: Did you have total freedom as Jews at this time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="475">A: Officially no because the official party line of the Italian Nazi government with Mussolini was also that Jews had to be deported and rounded up, but the orders were not quite as effective and there was very little discipline in the Italian army, and those people who were in the army just couldn't care less whether we were Jews or something else. </sentence><sentence id="476">They simply couldn't care less so we were supposed to officially hide that we were Jews, but they knew fully well we were and I think we were fairly free to go and do as we pleased. </sentence><sentence id="477">I'm not sure, I think that the order of deportation sort of depended on your nationality and so my parents at the time might have become <span class="country">Czechoslovakian</span> or something like that and giving me a different name and that name I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="478">If you had Czechoslovakian papers it really didn't matter at the time whether you were Jewish or not. </sentence><sentence id="479">For a short period of time the authorities respected the nationality versus your ethnic background. </sentence><sentence id="480">That didn't last, but for a short period of time it was that way and the soldiers who were supposed to execute the orders couldn't care less. </sentence><sentence id="481">I mean they just did not round up people. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="493">Q: Do you remember about how long you were there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="495">A: I would say also about ten months or so approximately and then when <span class="country">Italy</span> capitulated and the Germans came marching in through the part of <span class="country">France</span> that had previously been occupied by the Italians. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1235">A: In terms of who I am today, I would have liked all this activity around survivors of the war whatever events took part in their own lives to happen earlier because even as I tell these things and some of these things bring tears to my eyes so that i know that I still feel them, but they're not -- I think I'm now perhaps able and it hasn't been that long -- able to associate my reactions to trauma and whatever from the past. </sentence><sentence id="1236">So, it's hard for me to say now. </sentence><sentence id="1237">The worst part of it was the fear, you know the absolute terror that I can still invoke certain times thinking back particularly --the salient points were in that <span class="building">home</span> where I just didn't know where anybody was. </sentence><sentence id="1238">And then when my dad was taken. </sentence><sentence id="1239">These were just terrible, terrible moments. </sentence><sentence id="1240">I know that until he died, my father -- I had many, many nightmares about anticipating his death that they were just really terrible and I was acting irrationally during many years in relation to him in terms of being so afraid that he would die that I could not even enjoy when I was near him. </sentence><sentence id="1241">He wasn't a well man, although he pulled together and rebuilt a life for himself and helped his brothers build their own lives, so he did a tremendous job. </sentence><sentence id="1242">I couldn't even appreciate any of this. </sentence><sentence id="1243">I was just always afraid of losing him so that was sort of something that marred my life for a long time. </sentence><sentence id="1244">In fact, I think I was liberated from that feeling only when he died. </sentence><sentence id="1245">When he finally died, I sort of gained some peace which seems sort of crazy, but that's what happened. </sentence><sentence id="1246">When he died, I said okay that's over. </sentence><sentence id="1247">He's really gone and he's not coming back. </sentence><sentence id="1248">That's it. </sentence><sentence id="1249">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1250">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1251"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 9 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1270">Q: Are you at all religious today? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1272">A: No, I'm not, but I observe the traditions because I think they're pretty and perhaps only recently I have trouble with dogma in general. </sentence><sentence id="1273">I have trouble with authority, but there is sort of a deeper philosophy which guides the lives of those who are truly religious and I really don't refer to people who are shut off from the outside world like or that type of think. </sentence><sentence id="1274">I'm thinking of my brother who is really an exceptional human being in that he lives his religion. </sentence><sentence id="1275">This is who he is in terms of his interaction with his wife and his children, his family. </sentence><sentence id="1276">He lives in <span class="populated place">Jerusalem</span> because that's the only place where he can be the full Jew in his view, but he's politically left wing so -- and when I see him, there's a deep meaning to the rituals that is not the superficial type of thing that many people see and rebel against which is the things that I rebel against. </sentence><sentence id="1277">You can't go here, things that look totally idiotic to me. </sentence><sentence id="1278">It's a lot easier to take an <span class="spatial object">elevator</span> let's say for a person my mother's age and condition than to walk <span class="interior space">upstairs</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1279">That kind of thing, but when you go deeper and you make it part of an entire frame work and what it means, then I'm beginning to appreciate it although I think I live my life in a certain way in that sense, in terms of how I relate to my mother and to my family and I'm really a very good friend. </sentence><sentence id="1280">People know that I'm really a loyal friend, that you couldn't have a more loyal friend. </sentence><sentence id="1281">But I have no inclination to do the ritual, but I do like to go to <span class="building">synagogue</span> on high holidays only because I identify with the group, because I like to be identified with the Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="1282">I'm proud of them. </sentence><sentence id="1283">But not in terms of observing the things that I consider interfering with the conduct of modern life. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1296">Q: The obvious reason I asked that was clearly during the war years you appeared to be a little bit resentful of it and sort of embraced the security of the <span class="building">catholic church</span> and all these other things and I think people certain people after the Holocaust felt stronger about their Judaism, some felt irrelevant. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1300">Q: Or they had been abandoned by it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1302">A: I think those that felt abandoned by it I felt abandoned by it, but as I said the story about my grandfather and the angels, I was maybe four years old when I asked him that, which I mean this is a logical question to ask. </sentence><sentence id="1303">Where are your angels, and there's no logical answer to that. </sentence><sentence id="1304">So, then of course there was no time to practice the religion after that whole incident because we weren't supposed to be Jews anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1305">That's one of the things I resented when my dad came back. </sentence><sentence id="1306">I embraced catholicism only because it represented a safe haven and not because of anything that had to do with Jesus or anything like that, didn't appeal to me very much. </sentence><sentence id="1307">What appealed to me really was the ritual and not the content. </sentence><sentence id="1308">What appeals to me in Judaism really is more the content and not the ritual. </sentence><sentence id="1309">The ethics behind it and so I think I'm a very Jewish person and I don't hide that anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="1310">Perhaps if I were in a place where nobody observed anything I would do it just to express my Judaism to the rest of the world that way, but I don't feel that I have to do that. </sentence><sentence id="1311">But as I said, I do identify with the group, so --my mother says that after the war my little girlfriend, the one that I had spent all this time with in the <span class="building">home</span> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1312">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1313"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0 and so on and we stayed friends for a while after. </sentence><sentence id="1314">She became religious and I wasn't, but a certain point in time we were going to <span class="building">synagogue</span> for the high holidays and our mothers would try and make us pray and we would just giggle. </sentence><sentence id="1315">I mean that's all we'd do, we'd giggle. </sentence><sentence id="1316">We could just not do pray or do anything. </sentence><sentence id="1317">Then when I went to study, I left <span class="building">home</span> and I went to <span class="country">Switzerland</span> and the very first Rosh Hoshana Eve I went to <span class="building">synagogue</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1318">I didn't even go inside. </sentence><sentence id="1319">I stayed outside the entire time, but I was there. </sentence><sentence id="1320">You know, I just felt that I had to express that I was part of that group but I wasn't going to pray because the prayers meant nothing to me. </sentence><sentence id="1321">The prayers are sometimes very pretty if you look at them in terms of poetry, but I really don't believe in God. </sentence><sentence id="1322">I really don't believe in that at all. </sentence><sentence id="1323">So, my religion would be expressed in terms of how people should relate to one another and nothing to do with some superior being. </sentence><sentence id="1324">I'm a scientist and I don't believe in that at all. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1352">A: Well, the only thing is that you can overcome anything. </sentence><sentence id="1353">You at some point have to take responsibility for your own life, no matter how bad. </sentence><sentence id="1354">If you do that, you won't be alone. </sentence><sentence id="1355">If you persist in living in the past and saying that you can't do anything and nothing is going to work out because you went through this terrible thing, then you will remain stagnate and people will shy away from you and you'll just be a very lonely person. </sentence><sentence id="1356">I like to be with people. </sentence><sentence id="1357">I don't like to be alone. </sentence><sentence id="1358">That's all I have to say. </sentence></p></dialogue>
