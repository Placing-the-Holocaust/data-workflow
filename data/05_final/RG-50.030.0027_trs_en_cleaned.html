<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="6">My name is Isaac Bitton. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="9">Q: Where and when were you born? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="11"> A I was born in <span class="populated place">Lisbon</span>, <span class="country">Portugal</span>, March 31st, 1926. </sentence><sentence id="12">I was born in the <span class="building">hospital</span> at <span class="populated place">Hiletia</span> in <span class="populated place">Lisbon</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="15">Q: Tell me about your family and about what it was like growing up in your family. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="17">A: My...my mother was born and raised in <span class="populated place">Farouh</span> in the south of <span class="country">Portugal</span>. </sentence><sentence id="18">And...uh...most of the Jewish people that came to <span class="country">Portugal</span> towards the end of the 1700s and beginning of the 1800s...uh...settled down in <span class="populated place">Farouh</span>. </sentence><sentence id="19">And there was a very large <span class="populated place">community</span> lodged and relatives over 126 families within approximately 100 years. </sentence><sentence id="20">By the 1900s they all disappeared so that <span class="country">Portugal</span>...uh...<span class="populated place">Farouh</span> today is...there is no Jewish life. </sentence><sentence id="21">But my mother was born there. </sentence><sentence id="22">She moved to <span class="populated place">Lisbon</span> with my grandparents which originally came from...uh...uh... <span class="country">Morocco</span>, <span class="region">Spanish Morocco</span> and <span class="region">French Morocco</span>. </sentence><sentence id="23">Therefore, my name Bitton which is a French, actually a French broken name. </sentence><sentence id="24">Uh...And of course my mother was married in <span class="populated place">Lisbon</span> and...uh...we were five brothers and five sisters, 5 boys and 5 girls and...uh...I attended...the uh...the...uh...the <span class="building">schools</span> in...in <span class="populated place">Lisbon</span>...and...uh...the <span class="building">Jewish school</span>...was a <span class="building">private Jewish school</span>...uh...where we were taught Hebrew so we could...uh...we could read...uh...the prayer books. </sentence><sentence id="25">Because my family came from a reasonable religious...uh...family. </sentence><sentence id="26">Not orthodox, but...uh...religious. </sentence><sentence id="27">And we all had to learn Hebrew and...uh...we did so. </sentence><sentence id="28">At <span class="building">home</span> my...my grandparents, primarily my grandmother spoke some Spanish and...uh...Lidino actually, and some of the Portuguese. </sentence><sentence id="29">And...uh...basically, I...1 grew up amongst the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span> which was very, very small at that time. </sentence><sentence id="30">There was not much activity amongst the Jew youth. </sentence><sentence id="31">There was actually not too many youth in...in <span class="populated place">Lisbon</span>, <span class="country">Portugal</span>. </sentence><sentence id="32">And...uh...my oldest brother had actually begun to have some girl friends, not Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="33">My father was very upset about it and...uh...as I used to go to <span class="building">school</span> to learn Hebrew by...uh...a lady that also was a Moroccan...uh...Jewish teacher, she had in her...uh...<span class="interior space">living room</span> several pictures of...uh...of...uh...of <span class="country">Israel</span>, of _ <span class="country">Israel</span> at the time from the <span class="dlf">wailing wall</span> and others. </sentence><sentence id="34">And...uh...1 was always impressed by those pictures. </sentence><sentence id="35">Always! </sentence><sentence id="36">And that created in me a great desire at the time to...to go to <span class="country">Israel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="37">Already from a little, early childhood. </sentence><sentence id="38">And suddenly when the opportunity knocked in 1943, then I went to <span class="country">Israel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="39">But in the meantime, my Aunt Esther ____ Bitton, my father's sister, used to work at...uh...there was a <span class="interior space">Portuguese soup kitchen</span> primarily at the time used for the poor...the poor Jews of <span class="populated place">Lisbon</span>. </sentence><sentence id="40">And during the second world war, obviously this <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> became very very influential in assisting the refugees to have one hot meal a day. </sentence><sentence id="41">And it was there that I really began to...uh...hang around a lot of time simply because I was...uh...I was very  impressed by the various languages spoken. </sentence><sentence id="42">Uh...At the time I spoke Portuguese and a little bit of Spanish, but when you begin to hear Yiddish...lot of...lots of Yiddish...uh...lots of German...uh...Hungarian, Czech. </sentence><sentence id="43">I remember families from <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="44">Uh...I was always very impressed by...by these languages and...and uh...and I used to help...used to help buy...uh...the sitting....the sitting arrangement. </sentence><sentence id="45">There were probably within the dozen <span class="spatial object">tables</span>...uh...each <span class="spatial object">table</span> would care approximately hundred...10... 10...uh..._people so the <span class="interior space">dining room</span> for the refugees was within...uh...150 persons sitting capacity. </sentence><sentence id="46">And there was another small <span class="interior space">dining room</span> which was for the Portuguese...uh...the <span class="populated place">Portuguese community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="47">And next to the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>, <span class="interior space">soup kitchen</span> was a <span class="building">Jewish hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="48">I was born in a <span class="building">Jewish hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="49">So was my entire family. </sentence><sentence id="50">It was a very small <span class="building">hospital</span>, but nevertheless they took care of...uh...of the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="51">So...uh...and...uh...it was during this period in history that...uh...one day while I was at the <span class="interior space">soup kitchen</span> I hear...one family walks in...several children, father and mother...very well dressed, not dressed like a refugee as such...uh...with crumbly clothing, but really very nice and neat...uh...and L.. asked the gentleman. </sentence><sentence id="52">I said...I fact I told him, "Excuse me. </sentence><sentence id="53">This...this is for the refugees...this <span class="interior space">dining room</span>." </sentence><sentence id="54">And he said...uh..-uh... ... in Portuguese...he said, "But we too are refugees." </sentence><sentence id="55">And...uh...1 couldn't quite understand it. </sentence><sentence id="56">I was a teenager at the time, but still...uh...[ asked him, "Why is that you are refugee. </sentence><sentence id="57">You...you are Portuguese. </sentence><sentence id="58">How can you be a refugee." </sentence><sentence id="59">And...uh...he asked me to sit down. </sentence><sentence id="60">And it was then that I...I met the very famous...uh...humanitarian, Dr. - _ who told me that he was the ex-consul of <span class="country">Portugal</span> in <span class="populated place">Bordeaux</span>, <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="61">And he went on to tell me that he had been expelled by the Portuguese government simply because he had refused...he...he was asked to refuse to give...uh...uh...visas to the...to the Jewish refugees. </sentence><sentence id="62">And...uh...as a result, of course, he was removed from his position. </sentence><sentence id="63">He was disbarred because he was a lawyer by trade also, and removed from the <span class="building">diplomatic corps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="64">And...uh..I met him in <span class="populated place">Lisbon</span> at the <span class="interior space">soup kitchen</span> within...I do not remember exactly if he was 4 or a half a dozen. </sentence><sentence id="65">We spoke briefly. </sentence><sentence id="66">He was there in <span class="dlf">line</span> standing with...uh...family to get his hot meal and...and to date I couldn't...I...I never got out of my mind simply that the..the men of his stature...of his caliber...uh...that had ...had really helped saved lives, was punished in such manner by being removed from...from his...doing his job. </sentence><sentence id="67">And...uh...1 was very impressed and these image always stayed with me. </sentence><sentence id="68">Uh...L...L..I don't believe I can really tell you a great deal more about Dr. because I met him such a short few times. </sentence><sentence id="69">But I remember portions of the family. </sentence><sentence id="70">And...uh...uh...I remember the...the refugees primarily more so that were there in most cases because they were the fortunate ones that had received visas by Dr. in <span class="populated place">Bordeaux</span>, <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="71">Uh...I remember a family by the name of Deutsch, father, mother and two children who...they set up a <span class="building">shop</span> in the most busy <span class="dlf">street</span> in <span class="populated place">Lisbon</span> which is called the <span class="dlf">Sheadu</span>. </sentence><sentence id="72">In fact, it was burned out recently. </sentence><sentence id="73">Was on the portions of the <span class="populated place">city</span> that was burned...ancient part of the <span class="populated place">Lisbon</span>. </sentence><sentence id="74">And...uh... Mr.Deutsch used to put...uh...a <span class="spatial object">table</span> about maybe 3 by 3 and used to sell razor blades and other little things. </sentence><sentence id="75">And I help him bring them to the <span class="region">areas</span>. </sentence><sentence id="76">I used to help also to bring the refugees to some...some new <span class="building">residences</span> since they were not quite familiar with <span class="populated place">Lisbon</span> and I was quite familiar with <span class="populated place">Lisbon</span>. </sentence><sentence id="77">Uh...There was another family...uh...by the name of Goostave Zumich...Zumich. </sentence><sentence id="78">He was from <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="79">Uh...Uh...He was a <span class="building">shoemaker</span>, and he set up shop...uh...at the <span class="interior space">soup kitchen</span>, one of the <span class="dlf">corners</span>. </sentence><sentence id="80">And there he  would repair the shoes from the refugees. </sentence><sentence id="81">And...uh...l remember Mr. Brown who was also a German Jew who...uh...was the liaison between the refugees and the Jewish...uh...Portuguese community. </sentence><sentence id="82">He was in charge of... uh...uh...helping them to...uh...go and...uh...he was the one that would ask me at times, why...why don't you show this person where such and such a <span class="dlf">street</span> is and so forth and so on. </sentence><sentence id="83">And...uh...1 remember a family by the name of, I believe Grallman, who...uh...uh...whose lady had...uh...uh... a very small little girl, a child, but she became quite ill. </sentence><sentence id="84">She was hospitalized in <span class="populated place">Lisbon</span>....uh... for I believe was mental stress. </sentence><sentence id="85">And my Aunt Esther, God bless her soul, took care of her daughter for a given period of time and for as long as she was hospitalized prior to moving to <span class="country">Israel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="86">Later on, since we traveled on the same <span class="spatial object">ship</span> to <span class="country">Israel</span>...uh...the family asked me to join their own family in <span class="populated place">Nahariyya</span> in a little <span class="dlf">farm</span>, which I did. </sentence><sentence id="87">That's how come I arrived in <span class="populated place">Nahariyya</span>. </sentence><sentence id="88">It was through the <span class="building">Grallman family</span>. </sentence><sentence id="89">And...uh...basically...uh...sometimes when I remember of the...uh...the...uh...the incidences...you know, you are a young man and...uh...up to that point in time in history, life in <span class="country">Portugal</span> as such and <span class="populated place">Lisbon</span> was quite uneventful for a young man. </sentence><sentence id="90">And...uh...suddenly when all these refugees start to come in...uh...it was very exciting. </sentence><sentence id="91">I could not understand what they were saying in most cases, but they would...uh...they would come to this <span class="interior space">soup kitchen</span> a little before noon. </sentence><sentence id="92">If it was an hour before, and they would...in groups...you could sit them right in the...uh... the ___ and in <span class="populated place">Lisbon</span> is still today a <span class="dlf">street</span> that has no end, you know. </sentence><sentence id="93">It...is two little <span class="dlf">corners</span> like. </sentence><sentence id="94">You must turn around to come out. </sentence><sentence id="95">And...uh...they would walk around there, talking about problems, families, the anxiety, what happened to other members of the family because they did not know. </sentence><sentence id="96">They hadn't heard from them. </sentence><sentence id="97">Uh...And...uh...this to me was all very exciting and...uh...as a matter of fact, it reinforced in me even more so my wants to...to go to <span class="country">Israel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="98">And...uh...it was at some point in time that we met...uh... members of...uh...the...uh...Sofnut that came from <span class="populated place">Lisbon</span> to ...uh...uh...help the refugees to immigrate to <span class="country">Israel</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>

(clearing throat), there was a time during the war that in the north of <span class="country">Portugal</span>, they had found <span class="populated place">wolfrum</span>. </sentence><sentence id="211">And that's some type of a metal. </sentence><sentence id="212">I do not know that much about it. </sentence><sentence id="213">But it's sometime of a metal that you must mix...uh... with other metals...uh...specifically for <span class="building">armory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="214">And, of course...uh...that became very, very exciting all over <span class="country">Portugal</span>. </sentence><sentence id="215">And many people just left the <span class="populated place">town</span> and went to the <span class="region">north</span> to try to work on the <span class="dlf">wolfrum mines</span>. </sentence><sentence id="216">And, of course, being an adventurer myself...uh...me and a few friends, we decided that it was the time for us to go and dig <span class="env feature">wolfrum</span> too. </sentence><sentence id="217">So...uh...we...we went there, but we were very...most unsuccessful. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="226">No sooner than we were there, we turned around and came back to <span class="populated place">Lisbon</span> because, of course, we had no...no...no means...no...no money. </sentence><sentence id="227">And...uh...however little money we had...uh...didn't last that long, and I came back, of course...uh...very, very broken-hearted that I did not make a million escudos on the <span class="dlf">wolfrum mines</span>. </sentence><sentence id="228">But...uh...that was an exciting thing. </sentence><sentence id="229">And as much as life generally speaking in <span class="populated place">Lisbon</span> at the time for as far as I can remember...uh...other than going to <span class="building">school</span> at the time, L...uh...being a member of a large family and my father, at the time...uh....God bless his soul, was working for the <span class="building">Portuguese printing department</span> of the Portuguese government. </sentence><sentence id="230">And he certainly did not earn that much money either. </sentence><sentence id="231">So...uh...it was up to us...the growing up children to help the family. </sentence><sentence id="232">So, other than <span class="building">school</span>, we would pick up whatever job we could, me and my brothers. </sentence><sentence id="233">And...uh... I was involved in the dismantling, believe it or not, of <span class="dlf">World War I mines</span> and...uh...we had a little wrench. </sentence><sentence id="234">There must have been a million bolts and nuts in these <span class="dlf">mines</span>, and we spent all day unknotting these...these things. </sentence><sentence id="235">Uh...Another job that I took was...uh...working on <span class="spatial object">ships</span> by derusting the ballast of the <span class="spatial object">ships</span>. </sentence><sentence id="236">You know, if you're familiar with the <span class="spatial object">ship</span> ballasts, they're little <span class="dlf">oval holes</span> at the bottom of the <span class="spatial object">ship</span>, and you go in with a little swimming suit and you go with your feet and your head and your...your arms and you stay there all day with a little hammer, and all you do is knock down the rust that accumulates in these little <span class="interior space">cubicles</span>, You know, they're very small <span class="interior space">cubicles</span>. </sentence><sentence id="237">Uh... That was another part of a job. </sentence><sentence id="238">And I did other minuscule jobs and working on...uh...helping to manufacture of...uh...<span class="spatial object">bicycle</span>, painting, etc. </sentence><sentence id="239">And...uh...by and large, the...uh...there was an exciting period in <span class="populated place">Lisbon</span>. </sentence><sentence id="240">I remember the...uh...uh...there would be a...practically every day in the <span class="building">newspapers</span> some story about someone being killed. </sentence><sentence id="241">A spy or...or some activity...foreign activities...uh...in <span class="populated place">Lisbon</span>. </sentence><sentence id="242">And there is another thing that I used to do with my friends. </sentence><sentence id="243">We used to go to the <span class="building">German Consulate</span>. </sentence><sentence id="244">And they had always literature. </sentence><sentence id="245">Tons of literature! </sentence><sentence id="246">They would give away propaganda about <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="247">So we, of course, very diligently used to take as much as we could, and the moment we were out we used to toss it out in the <span class="spatial object">garbage</span>. </sentence><sentence id="248">So...uh...this was one of the things that we did...uh...for some obvious reasons...uh...actually. </sentence><sentence id="249">Another one function that I had...uh...was a neighbor of ours had a little shoe...uh...<span class="building">horse shoe shop</span>. </sentence><sentence id="250">He was a big, big man and...uh...he couldn't read or write. </sentence><sentence id="251">And...uh...he always...whenever I came back from <span class="building">school</span>, it was my function to come to him and read to him the newspaper and what was happening in the world. </sentence><sentence id="252">Because I used to like to read a lot. </sentence><sentence id="253">And...uh...and somehow or another we...we became very good friends, you know. </sentence><sentence id="254">And here was this big fellow. </sentence><sentence id="255">He couldn't read. </sentence><sentence id="256">I could never understand why he couldn't read either. </sentence><sentence id="257">But he was an older gentleman. </sentence><sentence id="258">And he was still doing the horse shoes...uh... in his <span class="building">shop</span>. </sentence><sentence id="259">Blacksmith? </sentence><sentence id="260">I  don't know how you call exactly, but...uh... So, by and large...uh...other than our going every...we had to go every night to the <span class="building">temple</span> because my father...uh...my father insisted that we go to the <span class="building">temple</span> every day...every night. </sentence><sentence id="261">You cannot come <span class="building">home</span> unless you've been to the <span class="building">temple</span> to the services. </sentence><sentence id="262">And...uh...every Friday night obviously...Saturdays, we used to go to <span class="building">temple</span>. </sentence><sentence id="263">So we conducted a reasonably...uh... 1 would say a moderate Jewish life. </sentence><sentence id="264">And...uh...our <span class="building">house</span> was...was, of course...uh...kosher. </sentence><sentence id="265">My father was quite kosher. </sentence><sentence id="266">And ...uh...we had a very large family, as I said...uh...uh... five boys and five girls. </sentence><sentence id="267">Although two of them were born...I...one girl... my youngest sister, Rachel, was born after I left <span class="country">Portugal</span>. </sentence><sentence id="268">And I did not meet her until 17... when she was 17. </sentence><sentence id="269">And my brother, Jacob, was...uh... few months old when I left for...for __, <span class="country">Israel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="270">So... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="316">Q: Did you feel...how did you feel being a Jew in <span class="country">Portugal</span> once the war...once the war had broken out? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="318">A: My only memories in this case is...uh...I didn't feel any...uh...truthfully...from the part of the Portuguese, I had no...no feelings that there were anti-Semitic or anti-Jewish or anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="319">Never had that feeling while I was in <span class="populated place">Lisbon</span>. </sentence><sentence id="320">That's the truth. </sentence><sentence id="321">Uh...But..-uh...by being in...uh...on a...almost on a daily basis, mixed with the Jewish refugees for a given period of time, that in itself inspired in me more so the desire really to go to <span class="country">Israel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="322">Number one, to go to <span class="country">Palestine</span> and to join the British Army, and go and fight the Nazis, which I did as a matter of fact. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="328">Q: Tell us about that. </sentence><sentence id="329">You started to say...you had started to tell us about the <span class="building">Sofnut</span>. </sentence><sentence id="330">Tell us about the refugees and _Sofnut. </sentence><sentence id="331">What happened? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="336">A: Certainly. </sentence><sentence id="337">Well, once we...uh..we...uh...we left <span class="country">Portugal</span>, our first stop was... </sentence></p></dialogue>

</sentence><sentence id="1111">And I just had arrived barely in <span class="populated place">Kavathim</span>... was a big, big <span class="dlf">circle</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1112">And all

and he then became...he received the highest medal from the Israeli army because he was the one who really went to the middle of the <span class="dlf">road</span> and just stopped that <span
