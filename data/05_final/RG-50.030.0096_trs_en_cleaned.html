<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="9">Q: Tell us a little bit about your childhood. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="11">A: My father at that time had these <span class="spatial object">vending machines</span> that were in the <span class="spatial object">subways</span> and <span class="spatial object">elevators</span>. </sentence><sentence id="12">It was quite a nice <span class="building">business</span>. </sentence><sentence id="13">But when World War II came along, they couldn't get sugar. </sentence><sentence id="14">So he had to let the business go, and we moved to <span class="populated place">Detroit</span>. </sentence><sentence id="15">In <span class="populated place">Detroit</span> my dad became a businessman and opened up a <span class="spatial object">laundry</span>. </sentence><sentence id="16">From there on I spent the rest of my life so far in that particular <span class="populated place">Detroit</span>, <span class="region">Michigan</span>. </sentence><sentence id="17">Now, during the childhood the things I can remember, the things that stick out, is that as a child my mother had my brother and I sitting on her lap on a <span class="interior space">windowsill</span> on <span class="dlf">Fifth Avenue</span> watching the parade coming back from the first world war. </sentence><sentence id="18">I also had the pleasure of riding in one of the last horse-and-buggy <span class="spatial object">street cars</span> of <span class="populated place">New York</span>. </sentence><sentence id="19">Then the next thing of memory is when I was 12 years old I started taking piano lessons, and when I was 14 I started playing square dances professionally with a fiddle player, violin player. </sentence><sentence id="20">Square dance people prefer to call themselves fiddle players. </sentence><sentence id="21">Then I went to the <span class="building">public school system</span> in <span class="populated place">Detroit</span> and graduated from <span class="building">high school</span> after I dropped out of <span class="building">school</span> when I was in eleventh grade. </sentence><sentence id="22">When I dropped out, I got interested in music again and went into <span class="building">Vaudeville</span> for a period of about three, four months. </sentence><sentence id="23">And when I came back, I had a good friend who talked me into going back to <span class="building">school</span>, which I did. </sentence><sentence id="24">And he enrolled me into the <span class="building">Castech</span> (phonetic), which is one of the <span class="building">schools</span> that was set aside for advanced students. </sentence><sentence id="25">I was fortunate because my friend happened to be the director of the <span class="building">Board of Education</span> at that time. </sentence><sentence id="26">And I went through the <span class="building">school</span> system of <span class="populated place">Detroit</span>, <span class="region">Michigan</span>. </sentence><sentence id="27">Went to <span class="building">Castech</span>. </sentence><sentence id="28">Then went to <span class="building">Wayne University</span> in <span class="populated place">Detroit</span> and continued my education into the <span class="dlf">medical field</span>. </sentence><sentence id="29">Premedics was at <span class="building">Wayne University</span>. </sentence><sentence id="30">Medics was at <span class="building">Wayne University</span>. </sentence><sentence id="31">I graduated from <span class="populated place">Wayne</span> as a doctor and immediately after spending a short period of internship became a member in the United States Army as a first lieutenant. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="53">Q: What year did you graduate from <span class="building">medical school</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="55">A: 1942. </sentence><sentence id="56">And then I had my internship, and I started residency. </sentence><sentence id="57">And from the residency I was drafted and ended up in the Army. </sentence><sentence id="58">Went in training at a <span class="building">field hospital</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="63">Q: When was that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="65">A: That was in "43. </sentence><sentence id="66">And for the purpose of training for a majority of -- for a major. </sentence><sentence id="67">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="68">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="69"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="75">Q: Did you specialize in anything at that point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="77">A: At that time I was in surgery. </sentence><sentence id="78">I was a resident in <span class="building">surgery</span>, and I continued that. </sentence><sentence id="79">When I was in the Army, I was placed in the <span class="building">hospital</span> as a surgeon for the <span class="building">170 VAC hospital</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="83">Q: Where was that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="85">A: At that time it was just being organized. </sentence><sentence id="86">We were the youngest group of enlisted men. </sentence><sentence id="87">The doctors were quite young. </sentence><sentence id="88">It was more like an experimental <span class="building">hospital</span> for the Army because they used to always hire -- not hire -- but place people of 35 or older in <span class="building">hospitals</span> and save the young fellows for the infantry and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="89">So we were quite a young group in general. </sentence><sentence id="90">From there we went overseas in March. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="97">Q: March of "43? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="99">A: Of 1943. </sentence><sentence id="100">And ended up in <span class="populated place">Belfast</span>, <span class="country">Ireland</span>, our first stop. </sentence><sentence id="101">We were training our enlisted men for hospital duty in the <span class="building">hospital</span> and were getting acquainted with the materials that we had to use when we were on the <span class="dlf">battlefield</span>. </sentence><sentence id="102">The training would be every day. </sentence><sentence id="103">The enlisted men would have classes and would actually practice on each other to develop their techniques. </sentence><sentence id="104">From there we moved to <span class="populated place">Denby</span> (phonetic), which was in <span class="region">North Ireland</span> -- <span class="region">North England</span>. </sentence><sentence id="105">And <span class="populated place">Denby</span>, <span class="country">England</span> -- we were there again training waiting for the invasion to occur. </sentence><sentence id="106">The invasion came, of course, on the 4th of June I think it is. </sentence><sentence id="107">The exact date I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="108">But we were scheduled to go behind the <span class="building">Army</span> and over to <span class="country">France</span> in July, the first of July. </sentence><sentence id="109">And that's when we went across the <span class="env feature">English Channel</span> and into the <span class="region">French territory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="110">From there we were placed at first with the first Army, who was at the <span class="dlf">beachhead</span> wiping up the remains of pockets -- the remaining pockets of Germans that were left behind. </sentence><sentence id="111">It was the policy at that time for the Army to move forward as fast as it can and not try to destroy all the Germans as we go but bypass them and let the infantry come in and finish up the work that we started. </sentence><sentence id="112">That's when we first started seeing patients in the <span class="building">hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="113">From there we followed to the third Army with Patton, and this was in <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="114">The first place was a <span class="dlf">beachhead</span>. </sentence><sentence id="115">The second place was the base of the <span class="region">Brest peninsula</span>, and the third place we went to -- and this was in a matter of less than a month or so -- was <span class="populated place">Crosan</span> (ph.), </sentence><sentence id="116">which was a little bit north of <span class="populated place">Brest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="117">As I said, we were with Patton, and we were transferred to the <span class="building">9th Amny</span> at that time. </sentence><sentence id="118">And then we finally came back and went back to Patton, and we followed them clear -- one of the <span class="building">hospital units</span> that followed him clear across Europe until the end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="119">We were in all the major battles at <span class="populated place">Brest</span> and <span class="populated place">Grodan</span> (ph.). </sentence><sentence id="120">And then we got involved in the <span class="populated place">Bastogne</span>, which was where the battle of the Bulge was. </sentence><sentence id="121">We were the only <span class="building">hospital</span> functioning in the <span class="region">Bulge</span> proper at the time, to our knowledge. </sentence><sentence id="122">We didn't know of any other <span class="building">hospital</span> at that time. </sentence><sentence id="123">In fact, our <span class="building">hospital</span> was listed as being missing because the communication was so bad during the Bulge. </sentence><sentence id="124">During that time we worked as much as 12 hours every day anyway, but I can remember that I saw 28 -- did 28 operations in those 12 hours we were so busy. </sentence><sentence id="125">As for the surgeons in the <span class="interior space">unit</span>, we spent most of the time in the <span class="building">hospital</span> doing surgery. </sentence><sentence id="126">Very little time to explore too much around the <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="127">And we were This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="128">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="129"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection always kept busy because we were behind Mr. Blood and Guts, Patton, and he moved fast. </sentence><sentence id="130">From there we went on and ended up in <span class="populated place">Regensburg</span> when the peace came, when it was declared, armistice was declared. </sentence><sentence id="131">And it moved back to <span class="populated place">Wurzburg</span> where we at that time started to disband the <span class="building">hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="132">I came back to the <span class="country">States</span> in 19 -- in fact, I arrived back in the <span class="country">States</span> New Year's of 1946. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="169">Q: Let's just back up a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="170">Let's trace some of the things that you commented on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="173">A: That's right. </sentence><sentence id="174">During that trip across the <span class="region">continent of Europe</span>, we came very close to a <span class="populated place">city</span> called <span class="populated place">Weimar</span> (phonetic) I think was the name. </sentence><sentence id="175">And I was sent on a mission by the colonel to <span class="populated place">Weimar</span>. </sentence><sentence id="176">And in the course of conversation with a police officer in a <span class="building">police station</span>, he told me that the Germans had just left <span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span>, a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> that was based in <span class="country">Germany</span> in one of the most -- one of the larger ones and most famous for the various things that they did and the cruelty that left a mark on people for life. </sentence><sentence id="177">He gave me directions as to how to go to <span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span>. </sentence><sentence id="178">He told me it was a five-mile route, and he showed me the <span class="dlf">road</span>. </sentence><sentence id="179">I got in a <span class="spatial object">Jeep</span> with my driver. </sentence><sentence id="180">We went out to see what we could see. </sentence><sentence id="181">I'll tell you the story of that. </sentence><sentence id="182">It was riding through a <span class="region">countryside</span> which was green and very interesting in itself, and we came upon the <span class="dlf">gates</span> of <span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="193">Q: How long a ride was it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="195">A: It was five miles. </sentence><sentence id="196">So I would say probably about 20 minutes. </sentence><sentence id="197">Not too much of a ride from <span class="populated place">Weimar</span>. </sentence><sentence id="198">In fact, it couldn't be too much of a ride because part of the story -- the prisoners would be paraded down the same <span class="dlf">road</span> into <span class="populated place">Weimar</span> on weekends and paraded through the <span class="populated place">city</span> where people would throw garbage and everything else on them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="203">Q: Did you have any particular thoughts on that ride out? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="205">A: At the time riding out I didn't know what I was going to see. </sentence><sentence id="206">We had heard all sort of rumors of the various <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="207">We had taken care of our own soldiers who happened to be captured at the Bulge and came back to the <span class="building">unit</span> after we overran the Germans, and the average -- of our own soldiers -- the average weight they would lose would be 38 pounds in a matter of two and a half months. </sentence><sentence id="208">And they would tell us the stories that they had, and we thought that was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="209">But we found out that it wasn't nearly as bad as what happened in <span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span>. </sentence><sentence id="210">When I walked into the <span class="dlf">gates</span> of <span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span>, there weren't any other soldiers in <span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span> at that time, and I felt that I was probably the first one through the <span class="dlf">gates</span>. </sentence><sentence id="211">The odd part about it -- the prisoners were walking around. </sentence><sentence id="212">The <span class="dlf">gates</span> were wide open. </sentence><sentence id="213">The prisoners were walking around in groups and talking, but I couldn't understand why there was no American soldiers or anybody who would guard the <span class="dlf">gates</span> or anything. </sentence><sentence id="214">They were wide open. </sentence><sentence id="215">Later on I found out that what had happened is that the SS troopers who were running the <span class="populated place">camp</span> fled from the <span class="populated place">camp</span> on April 11th, and the <span class="interior space">underground</span> which was in existence in <span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span>, in and about <span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span>, took over the <span class="populated place">camp</span> with the help of the prisoners and started straightening out the <span class="populated place">camp</span> before the American soldiers even arrived, which was a day or two later. </sentence><sentence id="216">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="217">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="218"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="233">Q: What did you see at the <span class="dlf">gates</span> when you pulled up? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="235">A: When we pulled up, there was a big emblem on the top of the <span class="dlf">gate</span> which stated -- and the words might be not exactly right -- but it said, "You enter through the <span class="dlf">gates</span>, and you leave by the way of the <span class="spatial object">furnace</span>" or <span class="dlf">chimney</span>. " </sentence><sentence id="236"><span class="dlf">Chimney</span>" is the word they used. </sentence><sentence id="237">That was there in German in a great big emblem. </sentence><sentence id="238">It was very prominently in a spot where you couldn't help from seeing the emblem. </sentence><sentence id="239">Then when you walked into the <span class="dlf">gate</span> in front of me -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="245">Q: The <span class="dlf">gate</span> was open? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="247">A: The <span class="dlf">gate</span> was open, and prisoners were walking in and out freely. </sentence><sentence id="248">No resistance. </sentence><sentence id="249">Nobody checking them or anything like that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="253">Q: Now, how long was that after the liberation of the <span class="populated place">camp</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="255">A: How long after the -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="257">Q: Liberation of the <span class="populated place">camp</span> did you go in? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="259">A: The SS troopers left on April 11th. </sentence><sentence id="260">This must have been either the 13th or the 12th -- the 13th -- that I was there. </sentence><sentence id="261">I can't remember the exact date because when we were working like we did, we didn't even know what date it was sometimes. </sentence><sentence id="262">In the <span class="building">hospital</span> we didn't keep track. </sentence><sentence id="263">But it was that time. </sentence><sentence id="264">I have it on the <span class="spatial object">chart</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="271">Q: Did your driver stay with you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="273">A: The driver was with me. </sentence><sentence id="274">It's customary that -- I was a captain at that time, and it's customary that officers didn't drive a <span class="spatial object">vehicle</span>. </sentence><sentence id="275">We had always a driver to drive us, and he also entered the <span class="populated place">camp</span> with me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="279">Q: You walked in on foot? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="281">A: We drove up there in the <span class="spatial object">Jeep</span> and left it outside of the first <span class="dlf">gate</span> or right inside of the first <span class="dlf">gate</span> and walked from there on. </sentence><sentence id="282">Right in front of us was three <span class="building">barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="283">Quite large. </sentence><sentence id="284">Went up about three to four <span class="interior space">floors</span> in height. </sentence><sentence id="285">And they were stationed one next to each other. </sentence><sentence id="286">And I remember walking up to the -- the first two you couldn't get in. </sentence><sentence id="287">They were locked. </sentence><sentence id="288">The <span class="dlf">doors</span> were locked. </sentence><sentence id="289">There was nobody walking with me. </sentence><sentence id="290">Nobody to stop me or prevent me from doing anything I wanted to do. </sentence><sentence id="291">And my purpose was to see as much as I could and try to see what this was all about. </sentence><sentence id="292">But the third <span class="building">barracks</span> was open, and I have taken pictures of that, which we'll probably show later on. </sentence><sentence id="293">And I had the opportunity to talk to the prisoners in the <span class="building">barracks</span>, and some of the stories that I'll tell you are from what the prisoners have told me. </sentence><sentence id="294">We had a pretty good idea before I went in there from our stories that we got out of our own soldiers and the prisoners that we took about things that were happening in these <span class="populated place">camps</span>, but This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="295">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="296"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection until you actually see them, it's hard to believe. </sentence><sentence id="297">In fact, when I came out of the Army, I didn't talk to anybody or even take all the things I had put in my <span class="spatial object">locker</span> and so forth that I'd brought back with me for over 46 years until now because it's nothing that you like to talk about. </sentence><sentence id="298">Besides that when you start telling the story, the people -- they look at you, and they say, oh -- they have the look that we really can't believe that. </sentence><sentence id="299">Well, the same ideas went through our head when we were looking at it. </sentence><sentence id="300">How can you believe this? </sentence><sentence id="301">After I got through visiting the first <span class="populated place">camp</span> and talking to the men, they would -- when the <span class="populated place">camp</span> became crowded -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="325">Q: Let's back up a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="326">You were looking into the <span class="building">barracks</span>, and what did you see? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="329">A: Well, there were these little <span class="spatial object">bunks</span> that they had. </sentence><sentence id="330">They were about six-by-four's. </sentence><sentence id="331">And they were originally made -- and part of this comes from the prisoners themselves -- they were originally made for four people to sleep in. </sentence><sentence id="332">And there were three <span class="interior space">decks</span> going up of these <span class="spatial object">bunks</span> the length of the <span class="building">barracks</span> on both sides of the <span class="building">barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="333">And when the <span class="populated place">camp</span> got crowded, they'd double up. </sentence><sentence id="334">And sometimes they had as many as twelve men in a place that would sleep three. </sentence><sentence id="335">And the sanitary conditions were terrible, and the stories that the prisoners told is how these people would get sick and have dysentery or so and would not be able even to go to the corner of the <span class="building">building</span> or so -- wherever they could go -- and they couldn't even get out of <span class="spatial object">bed</span>. </sentence><sentence id="336">So whatever they had to do they did, and from the top it just drained right down to the prisoners below. </sentence><sentence id="337">My impression at that time after I left that was that these <span class="building">barracks</span> were probably the very last <span class="building">barracks</span> the prisoner would be put in before they would be put to death in the <span class="spatial object">furnaces</span> or other means. </sentence><sentence id="338">Many of them died from disease. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="349">Q: Were there people in the <span class="building">barracks</span> -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="351">A: There were many people in the <span class="building">barracks</span> that I spoke to. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="353">Q: What -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="355">A: There were at least five or six in one of my camera shots. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="357">Q: How did you speak to them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="359">A: The prisoners that were in the <span class="building">barracks</span> wouldn't give you an idea of what happened to the other two <span class="building">barracks</span> because they were the most recent prisoners, and they looked like they were still well fed. </sentence><sentence id="360">They were entirely different than what was remaining in the other two <span class="building">barracks</span>, which we couldn't get in. </sentence><sentence id="361">But we know about them because we got the story back that they had to close those <span class="dlf">doors</span> because they couldn't leave these people walk around. </sentence><sentence id="362">They were infected with all sort of diseases, dysentery, and many of them were in the last stages. </sentence><sentence id="363">You couldn't do anything for them anyway. </sentence><sentence id="364">So they locked the <span class="dlf">doors</span> on them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="371">Q: How did you communicate to the prisoners you talked to? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="373">A: Well, that's the interesting part. </sentence><sentence id="374">It's amazing how many Germans were able to speak English. </sentence><sentence id="375">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="376">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="377"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Then you find out that in <span class="country">Germany</span> part of the <span class="building">school system</span> teaches the children when they're in the third, fourth grade -- they start them on three languages -- German, French and English. </sentence><sentence id="378">And this is part of their <span class="building">educational system</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="386">Q: How large was the <span class="building">barracks</span> when you went in? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="388">A: I'm sorry? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="390">Q: How large was the <span class="building">barracks</span> when you went into them? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="400">Q: What was the response of the prisoners to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="402">A: It seemed they were unusually quiet. </sentence><sentence id="403">They didn't react in a normal way, and I got the feeling they were afraid that tomorrow the Americans would be driven out and the Germans would be coming back. </sentence><sentence id="404">So they sort of didn't speak too much. </sentence><sentence id="405">You practically had to force them to give you answers sometimes by talking to them and sort of getting answers from them. </sentence><sentence id="406">But that was the feeling I had because they didn't -- even when I walked through the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, they didn't even bother to look up to see who was coming. </sentence><sentence id="407">So that the feeling I had is that they all had -- frankly, one of them said that, "We don't know how long you're going to be here." </sentence><sentence id="408">They were afraid that the Germans might return, and that was the impression I received. </sentence><sentence id="409">But the funniest thing -- not the funniest but one of the most memorable parts of that particular time that I walked through these <span class="building">barracks</span>, walked around the <span class="building">barracks</span> -- I was walking in back of the <span class="building">barracks</span> just to see what was back there. </sentence><sentence id="410">And as I walked by, a little <span class="dlf">window</span> that probably was about one foot square or thereabouts -- I heard a voice, and I turned around and I saw a living skeleton talk to me, was talking to me, and he said, "Thank God the Americans have come." </sentence><sentence id="411">And that was a funny feeling. </sentence><sentence id="412">Did you ever talk to a skeleton that talked back?And that's what I was doing. </sentence><sentence id="413">Later on I saw mounds of these living -- I mean these skeletons that the Germans left behind them. </sentence><sentence id="414">That brings back the story that when the prisoners -- when the SS troopers left, the <span class="interior space">underground</span> took over, as I said, and they cleaned up a lot of the things. </sentence><sentence id="415">So that didn't exist very long. </sentence><sentence id="416">When I left those <span class="building">barracks</span>, I went up to the <span class="building">administration building</span>, which was closer to the front of the <span class="populated place">camp</span> itself, <span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span>, and then talked to several of the prisoners there and one in particular who had a <span class="spatial object">specimen bowl</span> that we usually use in <span class="building">labs</span> -- <span class="spatial object">glass specimen bowl</span> that was about -- oh, I'd say about ten inches high and about four inches wide. </sentence><sentence id="417">And in there was three sections of skin that had tattoos on them in this <span class="spatial object">vase</span> which was saturated in a liquid of preservative. </sentence><sentence id="418">And the prisoner told me -- and he held it up for me to take a picture of -- he told me when the prisoners would first come into the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, they would be lined up. </sentence><sentence id="419">And the Commander's wife would walk down the <span class="dlf">line</span>, and wherever she saw anybody with a tattoo she would point to them, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="420">It is not the primary source,

the last they saw of the prisoner. </sentence><sentence id="422">And this is the stories from the prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="423">And it just happens that what they were doing -- they would get the skin off the people, and they were making <span class="spatial object">lampshades</span> out of them. </sentence><sentence id="424">These <span class="spatial object">lampshades</span> were in the <span class="building">building</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="425">I didn't have a chance to get into the <span class="building">building</span> at the time, but my nurse did with other nurses. </sentence><sentence id="426">And they had witnessed about four or five <span class="spatial object">lampshades</span> that were made out of -- the top of it was made out of the skin of men with tattoos on them for them to give. </sentence><sentence id="427">One in particular was made for <span class="populated place">Goehring</span> -- and this is from my nurse that she had seen. </sentence><sentence id="428">It was made for <span class="populated place">Goehring</span>, and they said this was made only of the fliers that were downed in the war that they had taken these tattoos from. </sentence><sentence id="429">That was one of the things that sort of makes you feel very empty inside to think that people would be that barbaric. </sentence><sentence id="430">The Jews

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="521">A: <span class="dlf">Barbed wire</span> where they used to put the prisoners in when they first came off the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="522">They'd march them in there, and then they'd pass them in through the <span class="building">building</span> and give them their clothes they were supposed to where and orient them. </sentence><sentence id="523">And that was right across the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="524">Then down from there the <span class="dlf">road</span> continued on, and there was another section that led to another <span class="region">area</span> which probably was the <span class="building">barracks</span> for doctors or the officers and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="525">At least that's what I interpreted that to be. </sentence><sentence id="526">We had nobody to guide us. </sentence><sentence id="527">We just went through there, as I said. </sentence><sentence id="528">And on the other side of that was <span class="dlf">barbed wires</span>, and then the <span class="dlf">entrance</span> from the back was guarded by two <span class="building">guardhouses</span> on each side of the <span class="dlf">road</span> so that -- separating it from the <span class="populated place">camp</span> proper. </sentence><sentence id="529">Later I found out that the <span class="populated place">camp</span> was sectioned into three different sections. </sentence><sentence id="530">They had the small <span class="populated place">camp</span>, the large <span class="populated place">camp</span>, and then they had the <span class="populated place">tent camp</span> they called it. </sentence><sentence id="531">And that was put up later on for the Polish people when <span class="country">Germany</span> started sending the Polish people into the <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="532">Then the <span class="building">administrating building</span>, as I said, was the one we went through. </sentence><sentence id="533">And the SS troopers had their <span class="building">barracks</span> there on the right side. </sentence><sentence id="534">And they had the <span class="building">ammunition factories</span>, which I didn't see. </sentence><sentence id="535">I think they were back in the <span class="env feature">woods</span> somewhere. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="553">A: Like walking through a different world. </sentence><sentence id="554">Not used to the tragedies that occurred there. </sentence><sentence id="555">The pictures of the -- they had these dummies at the <span class="dlf">entrance</span> showing how they were whipped or clubbed -- actually, it was a <span class="building">club</span>. </sentence><sentence id="556">They had another one hanging from a <span class="dlf">limb</span>, which represented hanging from the <span class="env feature">trees</span>. </sentence><sentence id="557">And then they had, of course, the <span class="spatial object">furnaces</span>. </sentence><sentence id="558">You could see those. </sentence><sentence id="559">Great big <span class="spatial object">stacks</span>, <span class="spatial object">white stacks</span>, back there that you could see the <span class="spatial object">furnaces</span>. </sentence><sentence id="560">Now I'm trying just to think if there's anything that I can think of -- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="797">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="798">I'm trying to think of -- I saw -- in one case I saw -- one of the prisoners was digging on the <span class="env feature">ground</span> with a little tiny <span class="spatial object">ax</span> or so, and I couldn't understand what he was digging a <span class="dlf">hole</span> for. </sentence><sentence id="799">And I asked -- the prisoner came by, and he said, oh, he's burying his food. </sentence><sentence id="800">He said they bury the food, and then they felt that we wouldn't be there long. </sentence><sentence id="801">They wanted to have some food after we left. </sentence><sentence id="802">And this came right from the soldier. </sentence><sentence id="803">So he must have had a fact because I couldn't understand why he was doing it at the time. </sentence><sentence id="804">But I think one of the methods of destroying the prisoners was a planned diet that gradually resulted in malnutrition, and the people really just died from lack of food over a period of several months, which gave -- the Jewish prisoners when they first came in were assigned to the <span class="building">factories</span> to work or to the -- they had a <span class="dlf">stone mine</span> there that they were digging from. </sentence><sentence id="805"><span class="env feature">Stones</span> and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="806">They were getting labor done cheap by putting these Jews and prisoners to work in their <span class="building">ammunition factories</span> and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="807">But along with that I think was this constant planned reduction diet, which ended up in these people dying or getting weak enough so they couldn't work, and then they were put into these -- and this is my own impression I had when I left the <span class="populated place">camp</span> -- they were eventually put into one of these three <span class="building">buildings</span> there just to be there and die and be burned through the <span class="spatial object">furnaces</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="819">Q: What were some of the other conversations you had with the prisoners while you were there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="821">A: That's about all. </sentence><sentence id="822">They wouldn't talk, most of them. </sentence><sentence id="823">They didn't go out of their way to talk. </sentence><sentence id="824">If This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="825">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="826"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 2 you talked to them, they would respond. </sentence><sentence id="827">That's how I got the answers I did. </sentence><sentence id="828">One other thing is they mentioned that when they would beat these soldiers -- or these prisoners -- or hung them up, they would strip them down nude. </sentence><sentence id="829">If you look at the bodies that you'll see in these <span class="spatial object">piles</span>, you would see the black and blue marks of bruises on what was left of the skin and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="830">And I mentioned about the expressions. </sentence><sentence id="831">And also that the bodies -- if you look at them, you think they all reached the same stage before they died because they all looked so similar in the amount of malnutrition that you see. </sentence><sentence id="832">And I've seen many people in the <span class="building">hospital</span> that would take them quite a while to reach that stage of malnutrition. </sentence><sentence id="833">So they weren't killed instantly. </sentence><sentence id="834">They were dragged on until they were weak enough that they couldn't do anything. </sentence><sentence id="835">And then they'd get diseases, and many of them would commit suicide by themselves, and many of them would die from diseases and malnutrition. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="853">Q: Did you know anything about any of the medical experiments that were performed in <span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="855">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="856">They were using medical experiments, and the medical experiments they were using was, one, to study the effect of amputations and how to handle them. </sentence><sentence id="857">And I'll tell you a little bit about that in a minute. </sentence><sentence id="858">The other thing was giving them poisons in trying the strengths of the different poisons on people. </sentence><sentence id="859">And the other thing was using toxins that would irritate the skin like some of our gases do that we were using -- not we were using but the armies use sometimes in wars. </sentence><sentence id="860">Those are the three or four elements that they were -- some of them. </sentence><sentence id="861">And I also understand they were experimenting a lot on birth control. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="871">A: Sterilization. </sentence><sentence id="872">You see, the impression I received -- and this, again, was borne out later on -- they at first wanted the Jews to leave <span class="country">Germany</span>, and they did everything to encourage them to leave. </sentence><sentence id="873">And then eventually in "41 I think -- 11th of "41 or thereabouts -- Hitler decided to lull -- take the final solution. </sentence><sentence id="874">And that was his order. </sentence><sentence id="875">And then <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> was one of the places that used gas. </sentence><sentence id="876">They used cianide gas or carbon monoxide. </sentence></p></dialogue>
