<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="58">Q: What language did your family speak at <span class="building">home</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="60">A: We s -- our mother language was Jewish, but we spoke several languages. </sentence><sentence id="61">Is -- my father was perfect in German, in fact he was teaching German and so we spoke Jewish, we knew German, Czech. </sentence><sentence id="62">And then when the Hungarian occupied us, I really had to make a crash course, learning very quickly Hungarian, which I did for just to survive, because if I went to hide, I had to know the language. </sentence><sentence id="63">And being I was so young and I had -- I really had an aptitude to learn quickly languages and I learned it within a few months. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="68">Q: What kind of <span class="building">school</span> did you attend, did you attend <span class="building">secular school</span> or <span class="building">Jewish school</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="86">Q: Was there a significant Jewish population in <span class="populated place">Yasinna</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="88">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="89">It was a small <span class="populated place">town</span>, it was about, I would say -- we -- we were -- it was only about 12,000 occupants and approximately I would say that 50 percent were Jewish. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="92">Q: Was there harmony between Jews and non-Jews in the <span class="populated place">town</span>, would you say, before the war began? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="94">A: Th-Th-The Czechs were very liberal and we had no anti-Semitism as far as the Czechs were concerned, but the Ukrainians were anti-Semitic, however they had absolutely no power, because they were not in power. </sentence><sentence id="95">The Czech government was in power, so there was, I would say there was pretty much what you would say, harmony. </sentence><sentence id="96">We were not usually great, I mean we did not socialize a lot, but on -- just on friendly basis, to say hello. </sentence><sentence id="97">But it - - somehow it was that Jews were mostly socializing with Jews and it was also, you know, they did not care too much for education, where we are very education minded. </sentence><sentence id="98">So there would have been also a <span class="dlf">gap</span>, as far as on an intellectual level. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="104">Q: Did that change -- did the harmony between Jews and non-Jews change after the Hungarian occupation? </sentence></p></dialogue>

did. </sentence><sentence id="111">So when they -- before -- before their occupation, the Ukrainian took over because the -- the Czechs had left, they -- they -- there was no Czech government any more and th-they -- so we were really in peril, because they were going to kill all the Jews in the <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="112">And -- so we were really very glad when the Hungarians came in because we thought that they are much more civilized and much more organized government, but we found out very soon that this was not the case. </sentence><sentence id="113">My father was born in -- in <span class="country">Poland</span>, but he was only two years when we came -- when he came to <span class="populated place">Yasinna</span> and he had Czech citizenships. </sentence><sentence id="114">They took away our Czech citizenship and eventually, a few months later, when I went to <span class="populated place">Plata frip</span> -- no, before that. </sentence><sentence id="115">As soon as the Hungarian came in -- I was 14 y -- not even quite 14, but -- but close to 14 and I was still in <span class="building">school</span>, of course and I didn't even finish the eighth grade, because I was -- in the eighth grade it was like -- like here a <span class="building">high school</span>, because our level of education was always very, very high. </sentence><sentence id="116">Let's say if you had <span class="building">high school</span> in -- in <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>, then it would be here -- like here two years of <span class="building">college</span>. </sentence><sentence id="117">Because we -- this is how they taught, because we didn't have like <span class="building">college</span> and right by us -- right after <span class="building">college</span>, you -- after <span class="building">high school</span>, you could go into <span class="building">medical school</span> or to <span class="building">law school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="118">Like my brothers. </sentence><sentence id="119">They studied, one studied law, one studied a dentistry, but it was right after they finished <span class="building">high school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="120">They didn't have to go first four years of <span class="building">college</span> and then four years to become a dentist or four years of <span class="building">college</span> and three years to become a lawyer. </sentence><sentence id="121">From as soon as we graduated <span class="building">high school</span>, you could go in right straight to <span class="building">law school</span> or to <span class="building">medical school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="122">But then we -- I was -- all the Jewish children were thrown out of <span class="building">school</span> as soon as the Hungarian came in and we were sent out, they sent me -- we could not return to <span class="building">classes</span> the next day, so -- so of course we had nothing to do. </sentence><sentence id="123">So one day I went This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="124">It is not the primary source, and it has not

station</span>, but my mother motioned to me I shouldn't come near, because she didn't want me to be arrested too. </sentence><sentence id="127">And there was already my brother's friend, who was a lawyer and he came over to me an-and he told me -- he bent down with me and he told me I sh -- because I wanted to go right away with my mother, I was very attached to my mother. </sentence><sentence id="128">Told me if I'll be on the outside, I'll be able to -- to help more and -- and I -- by then I had a married sister, so I really had this -- who to stay. </sentence><sentence id="129">And --

husband got cancer and -- and he didn't have very long to live. </sentence><sentence id="2298">My son David, we -- was -- was already danear religious, because we sent my children, all of my children, we sent to <span class="building">religious school</span>, like David went to <span class="building">Yeshiva</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2299">My oldest son Peter went to <span class="building">Yeshiva</span>, but Peter didn't like <span class="building">Yeshiva</span> and -- and didn't remain religious, he didn't keep anything, but we wanted to give our children the choice, that they should be able, if -- if they want to be religious and my husband went also to a <span class="building">Yeshiva</span> when he was young and we wanted them to have the same education and

television, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2310">I wanted him to be able to occupy, you know, not to think always about his sickness. </sentence><sentence id="2311">So David told me what the rabbi said, and he said, "You know, why don't you become religious, maybe this will help Dad." </sentence><sentence id="2312">And they are very, very close to their father and they loved him very much and -- and I loved him very much, but I knew there is no hope. </sentence><sentence id="2313">But I didn't want that my son should ever think for one day that I didn't try to help his father -- to save
