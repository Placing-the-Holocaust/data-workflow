</sentence><sentence id="156">But, as I understand it now, you see, and as J read in the newspaper and so forth, there were always requests of people to come to the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="157">They -- at -- at that time, in order to come to the <span class="country">United States</span>, [indecipherable] you needed a -- what's called a certificate -- zertifickat. </sentence><sentence id="158">And there were only a certain number of <span class="spatial object">zertifikats</span> available per year for people from <span class="country">Germany</span>, because a number of <span class="spatial object">zertifikats</span> had been set in nine [indecipherable] that time, and at that time the -- the -- the -- the -- I mean, the type of population in <span class="country">America</span> was different than it was in 1940 and 1950. </sentence><sentence id="159">So, many people got certificates but they were only dated for two or three years later. </sentence><sentence id="160">And who wanted to wait two or three years? </sentence><sentence id="161">We didn't want to wait two or three years. </sentence><sentence

already in the 20's, but my mother didn't want to go because she had all her family in -- in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="163">So that's why we stayed there.

" October 25, 1998 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="168">Q: I'd like you as an eyewitness, to tell me what was going on in that protest at <span class="building">madis</span> -- <span class="building">Madison Square Garden</span>. </sentence><sentence id="169">If you could describe the scene and what was said, and -- and the feelings that the people had. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="170">A: I don't know any more exactly what went on there. </sentence><sentence id="171">I can only tell you it was a very big meeting. </sentence><sentence id="172">You see, the <span class="building">Madison Square Garden</span> has a very big place and it was filled up to capacity. </sentence><sentence id="173">And there were many people who spoke about it, what happened in -- in -- in -- in <span class="country">Germany</span>, and what could be done and they wanted to -- they wanted to influence the American government to do something about it. </sentence><sentence id="174">In that respect, I mean a little bit to the side, when I was in the <span class="building">yeshiva</span>, there was a young man, he was young at that time, who came every week, every Thursday to the <span class="building">yeshiva</span> and from there he went on to <span class="populated place">Washington</span> to discuss with cabinet ministers to let Jews out. </sentence><sentence id="175">And his name was Michael Trist(ph), and the person he talked to that was discussing, Moshe Sherer, which recently passed away, became the president of the Agudath(ph) [indecipherable] organization. </sentence><sentence id="176">But every week they came out. </sentence><sentence id="177">And some of the <span class="building">yeshivas</span> and some of other organizations made it, but it was a very tough time because the <span class="country">United States</span> was interested -- and it is not against the <span class="country">United States</span>, the <span class="country">United States</span> was interested to win the war. </sentence><sentence id="178">If we win the war, then everything will change. </sentence><sentence id="179">So we cannot bomb the <span class="spatial object">trains</span> to the <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="180">And they heard the person, Jacob Rosenheim, | have his This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="181">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="182"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Jacob Wiener " October 25, 1998 book here, and I heard him speak many times, who le -- sent letters, and I have the copies of the letters which he sent to Roosevelt and other people to do this. </sentence><sentence id="183">Only one person was successful to a certain extent, a limited extent and it was Ruth Gruber, I don't know if you heard of her, who arranged with Secretary Ickes and Morgenstern(ph) and so forth, they arranged that thousand -- that they permit a thousand Jews to go to <span class="populated place">Oswego</span>, one of my family, and we also went to <span class="populated place">Oswego</span>. </sentence><sentence id="184">In -- that's in the -- <span class="populated place">Oswego</span> is near <span class="env feature">Lake Erie</span>, | think, it's in the state of <span class="region">New York</span>. </sentence><sentence id="185">So they did very many things, so the people came over and they were protesting and they were writing and they were talking to in-influential people. </sentence><sentence id="186">But it was not the mood at that time. </sentence><sentence id="187">It was just -- in fact, they never felt that anything bad happened to the Jews, and it could be changed, until Kristallnacht. </sentence><sentence id="188">I think by Kristallnacht it changed, because that was the first time that Roosevelt called his ambassador from <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> away and talked to him about what happened. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="209">Q: When the war was over, and you said you had read articles, not on the front page, about what had happened to the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="210">I would like to get a sense from you of what the Jewish community in the -- in the <span class="country">United States</span>, religious or secular, whatever you can share with me, what was the reaction of the Jewish community and -- and was there much said by the Jewish community? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="261">A: At that time there was already <span class="spatial object">television</span>, I think, 1946 and we tried to see -- look at the -- look at the <span class="spatial object">television</span>, find out what ha -- what was going to happen and we saw other people there. </sentence><sentence id="262">But in my impression, I mean the impression of most people was [indecipherable] that these people were so brainwashed, or crazy, or whatever you call this, you see, saying that I had nothing to do with it because I followed This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="263">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="264"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Jacob Wiener " October 25, 1998 orders. </sentence><sentence id="265">Same thing was when they killed my mother also, they said, we followed orders. </sentence><sentence id="266">But they did not have their own mind, they just said they followed orders. </sentence><sentence id="267">Of course, the world knew by that time that they could have done something because they had power and they had all the authority to do what they wanted to do and they didn't do it. </sentence><sentence id="268">And not only this, the worst thing of it, that they in- intimidated the whole population to do this -- to go in the same way. </sentence><sentence id="269">That no one actually acted freely on his own free will. </sentence></p></dialogue>

majority vote came out about <span class="country">Palestine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="283">That was going on for a long time, because it actually started long before the war. </sentence><sentence id="284">In 1936 with the British, you see, were not too happy and were not too much in favor of -- of it at all. </sentence><sentence id="285">And they even -- many people died
