<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="62">Q: All right, let's move ahead then to right before liberation. </sentence><sentence id="63">You said your mother came and got you from the family. </sentence><sentence id="64">Do you remember that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="68">A: Yes, I remember because by this time I was very attached to the Von der Lindens, specially Mrs. Von der Linden and she was very attached to me, like a son. </sentence><sentence id="69">And my mother showed up. </sentence><sentence id="70">She came and visited me occasionally. </sentence><sentence id="71">But this time she came and she wanted to bring me to my parents" hiding place which was an <span class="interior space">apartment</span> that looked like it was in a vacant <span class="building">building</span>. </sentence><sentence id="72">And I didn't know why she wanted to come and pick me up. </sentence><sentence id="73">I know, I was a little upset and Mrs. Von der Linden, also. </sentence><sentence id="74">But my mother said that she, I could come back after the liberation. </sentence><sentence id="75">So I went with my mother. </sentence><sentence id="76">We took the <span class="spatial object">street car</span>. </sentence><sentence id="77">And at some point, at a stop, there was a <span class="spatial object">German truck</span> came by. </sentence><sentence id="78">It was being pulled by a horse. </sentence><sentence id="79">Apparently it had run out of gas. </sentence><sentence id="80">And there was also a soldier lying on top of the <span class="spatial object">truck</span> with a heavy machine gun. </sentence><sentence id="81">They looked very insecure. </sentence><sentence id="82">They kept looking around and like expecting some, maybe to be shot at which is, was the case. </sentence><sentence id="83">But I didn't know that. </sentence><sentence id="84">My mother said, going to that scene, she said, always remember this. </sentence><sentence id="85">Don't forget. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="104">Q: And you still have remembered it? </sentence><sentence id="105">Very vividly. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="108">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="109">I have not forgotten it. </sentence><sentence id="110">So then we went, I thought we were going to the <span class="interior space">apartment</span> where my parents were hidden, but in fact we went around the <span class="dlf">corner</span> where there was a <span class="building">beauty parlor</span>. </sentence><sentence id="111">And I didn't know this before but one day my mother had been walking on the <span class="dlf">street</span> around the corner and some German soldiers came in the opposite direction on the same  https://collections.ushmm.org </sentence></p><p><sentence id="112"> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Harry Interview Markowicz 6 May 16, 2012 <span class="dlf">sidewalk</span> so she got a little panicky and she went into the <span class="building">beauty parlor</span>. </sentence><sentence id="113">And once she was inside, she was just standing there and the woman who ran this <span class="building">beauty parlor</span> told her come in the back. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="114">There were, in many <span class="building">stores</span> there was a <span class="interior space">living area</span>, behind the <span class="building">store</span>. </sentence><sentence id="115">And above the <span class="building">store</span>. </sentence><sentence id="116">And my mother hesitated to go in the <span class="interior space">back</span>. </sentence><sentence id="117">She was afraid. </sentence><sentence id="118">So the woman said that her husband was Jewish which was the case. </sentence><sentence id="119">And so they became friends and their <span class="interior space">backyards</span> were connected cause they were at right angles to each other and there was a <span class="dlf">wall</span> separating them but they made arrangements to go over the <span class="dlf">wall</span> in case some danger would happen to one or the other. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="120">In several cases, my parents went over the <span class="dlf">wall</span>. </sentence><sentence id="121">I don't remember these peoples" names, went over the <span class="dlf">wall</span>. </sentence><sentence id="122">One time I know it's because the Germans came to pick up the Jewish family living in the <span class="building">house</span> next <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="123">So they didn't know that it was, it wasn't for them, so they went over the <span class="dlf">wall</span>. </sentence><sentence id="124">And as it was getting close to liberation, my parents moved in with this couple and that's where my mother took me also. </sentence><sentence id="125">By this time, or maybe a day or two later you could hear the cannon fire in the distance. </sentence><sentence id="126">And so we knew that liberation was very, very soon to come. </sentence><sentence id="127">I remember once I was standing in the <span class="dlf">entrance</span> of the <span class="building">beauty parlor</span> and I saw, on the <span class="dlf">corner</span>, I saw a group of men wearing khaki, but they weren't soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="128">I didn't know who they were and they were carrying cases, looked like wooden cases and they opened them up and they were distributing rifles to other men that came along. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="129">So I went back in the <span class="building">beauty parlor</span> and I asked what's going on? </sentence><sentence id="130">Who are these people? </sentence><sentence id="131">And they were actually Belgians who were getting ready to join the fight against the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="132">Then again shortly after that, I don't know how many days went by, I think it was maybe one day or so. </sentence><sentence id="133">One morning my mother took me. </sentence><sentence id="134">She said we're going to go to, it was a <span class="dlf">park</span>. </sentence><sentence id="135">I didn't know exactly why we were going there. </sentence><sentence id="136">And she said the English are there. </sentence><sentence id="137">I'm not sure what she said actually but she said the English. </sentence><sentence id="138">She probably did but I'm not sure. </sentence><sentence id="139">I didn't know what that meant. </sentence><sentence id="140">And so we started going and I asked my mother, why isn't my father coming. </sentence><sentence id="141">And she tried to explain that he hadn't been outside, except to go to the <span class="building">beauty parlor</span> for two years and he was not ready to face people. </sentence><sentence id="142">So we were walking along. </sentence><sentence id="143">My mother was kind of in a hurry and we were on one <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="144">And we passed a <span class="building">tent</span> that was burned. </sentence><sentence id="145">And I was fascinated. </sentence><sentence id="146">I don't know if it was, I assume it was a <span class="building">German tent</span>, now looking back at it and probably a Molotov cocktail had been thrown at it. </sentence><sentence id="147">It was burning on top. </sentence><sentence id="148">And I didn't seen any soldiers, just fire. </sentence><sentence id="149">So I stopped to look. </sentence><sentence id="150">My mother said let's go and grabbed me, my hand and continued with a lot of  https://collections.ushmm.org </sentence></p><p><sentence id="151"> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Harry Interview Markowicz 7 May 16, 2012 other people. </sentence><sentence id="152">Everybody was rushing to this <span class="dlf">park</span>. </sentence><sentence id="153">And when we arrived there, there were <span class="spatial object">tanks</span> lined up in all the <span class="dlf">lanes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="154">It was all very strange. </sentence><sentence id="155">There were a lot of, a lot of civilians around the <span class="spatial object">tanks</span> and everybody was happy and cheering and my mother took me towards a <span class="spatial object">tank</span>. </sentence><sentence id="156">There was a soldier standing on it. </sentence><sentence id="157">And we looked at each other. </sentence><sentence id="158">We looked at the soldier, he looked at us. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="159">And then he put out his arms, downwards and my mother lifted me up and he grabbed me and -- (crying) -- he pulled me up. </sentence><sentence id="160">And he held me in his arms. </sentence><sentence id="161">I looked at my mother and she said, give him a kiss cause we didn't have any way of communicating with him. </sentence><sentence id="162">So I did and then I looked back down and she was crying. </sentence><sentence id="163">So I couldn't understand. </sentence><sentence id="164">That was all, this job that my mother was crying and she said it's all right and I remember the soldier kept smiling as if it was ok. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="165">After that, I don't remember all the details but my mother took me back to the Von der Lindens like she had promised to do. </sentence><sentence id="166">But there was another reason. </sentence><sentence id="167">My brother and sister were by then they were living in the <span class="region">Ardennes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="168">And my parents wanted to pick them up which wasn't easy because we had to go there by <span class="spatial object">train</span> or <span class="spatial object">municipal trams</span> maybe. </sentence><sentence id="169">But they weren't running. </sentence><sentence id="170">So and there was no communication so anyway I went back to the <span class="building">Von der Lindens</span> and I didn't really know how long I stayed there. </sentence><sentence id="171">I only figured out a few years ago when I went back to the <span class="building">Von der Lindens</span>. </sentence><sentence id="172">Every <span class="building">house</span> on the <span class="dlf">street</span> had a huge flag of the allies, American, British, French, Belgian. </sentence><sentence id="173">There wasn't a red flag. </sentence><sentence id="174">And these flags, I know how people made them. </sentence><sentence id="175">They were the size of double sheets hanging down in front of the <span class="building">houses</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="176">And then one day I went outside to play, as I usually did, but I quickly noticed that there were no flags on the <span class="building">houses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="177">So I went in and asked Mrs. Von der Linden. </sentence><sentence id="178">She ran a <span class="building">store</span>, sort of a <span class="building">hardware store</span>. </sentence><sentence id="179">And she said that the Germans might be coming back and she seemed very anxious cause I didn't know this at the time. </sentence><sentence id="180">It was many years later that I figure out this was the Battle of the Bulge. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="181">So this is the way I know that I spent much more time with the <span class="building">Von der Lindens</span> after the liberation than I originally thought because the Battle of the Bulge was in December. </sentence><sentence id="182">The liberation was in September. </sentence><sentence id="183">And so I was still with the <span class="building">Von der Lindens</span> at the time of the Battle of the Bulge, several months after the liberation. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="184">Then after probably a short time after that, I'm not sure. </sentence><sentence id="185">My parents had found, rented a <span class="building">house</span> and the <span class="interior space">apartment</span> where they lived was much too small for our family. </sentence><sentence id="186">And so they rented a <span class="building">house</span>, a nice little <span class="building">house</span> and my brother and sister and I were there, but also my cousin Lottie. </sentence><sentence id="187">

Her father was my mother's brother. </sentence><sentence id="189">And her parents had been deported on the last <span class="spatial object">transport</span> from <span class="country">Belgium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="190">Number, it was transport number 26. </sentence><sentence id="191">They also had a son who had the same name as my brother Manfred, or Mani. </sentence><sentence id="192">They were together. </sentence><sentence id="193">At some point they were hidden together by a priest who was well known for having saved a lot of, hundreds of Jewish children. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="194">Father Joseph Andre who has been recognized by <span class="building">Yad Vashem</span> and many other organizations. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="195">He placed the kids in <span class="building">convents</span> or <span class="building">orphanages</span> or in private families. </sentence><sentence id="196">But until he found the places they stayed with him. </sentence><sentence id="197">And both my cousin and my brother were with him when the Germans started watching him, suspecting that he was also involved in the <span class="interior space">underground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="198">So he had to go into hiding himself, the priest. </sentence><sentence id="199">And my brother went to live with a family that was not really -- were friends of the family my sister was staying with in the <span class="region">Ardennes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="200">But my cousin didn't have any place to go and so he went back to his parents" <span class="interior space">apartment</span> and they were denounced. </sentence><sentence id="201">They were seen during an air raid, probably going to the <span class="building">shelter</span> and they were deported. </sentence><sentence id="202">My aunt is the only one that came back. </sentence><sentence id="203">But they had a daughter, Lottie, who was hidden someplace else. </sentence><sentence id="204">So my parents took in Lottie and she was living with us. </sentence><sentence id="205">We still didn't know the fate of my mother's brother and his wife. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="206">One day his wife came to the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="207">I happened to be there alone one afternoon. </sentence><sentence id="208">The <span class="dlf">doorbell</span> rang and I opened the <span class="dlf">door</span> and there was this strange woman. </sentence><sentence id="209">Somebody I didn't know and she also looked strange a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="210">And she didn't say anything for a long time and I didn't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="211">I knew I wasn't supposed to let in strangers in the <span class="building">house</span> and she didn't say anything and finally she, she said I'm your aunt, Tante Dutche and I didn't recognize her. </sentence><sentence id="212">First two years had gone by since we had gone into hiding. </sentence><sentence id="213">But also she had been in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> during that time and on a death march. </sentence><sentence id="214">And so when she told me her name I let her in and my parents came <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="215">That evening, after dinner, my aunt kind of spilled her guts, told the whole story from the beginning to the end and they were all very, very quiet listening to her. </sentence><sentence id="216">And also at some point she pulled up her sleeve and we all kind of looked or leaned over to see what was on her arm. </sentence><sentence id="217">It was her number tattooed on her arm.

id="1113">So I went back to the chairman of the <span class="building">department</span> and said what is this graduate associate thing. </sentence><sentence id="1114">Can I do it? </sentence><sentence id="1115">Cause I don't have a PhD and I'd like to work on it. </sentence><sentence id="1116">He said oh sure, you can do that too. </sentence><sentence id="1117">And so I, and they paid very well too. </sentence><sentence id="1118">So I became a graduate associate and taught French and I got my MA degree there. </sentence><sentence id="1119">Meanwhile, while I was there, I got interested in sign language, completely by chance. </sentence><sentence id="1120">I'll make it very brief. </sentence><sentence id="1121">I had in mind a research project involving linguistic universals which had become popularized or not only got popular but they were introduced by Chomsky, Noam Chomsky. </sentence><sentence id="1122">And but it involved doing a little experiment with artificial languages to discover whether one could learn a language more easily if it had universals. </sentence><sentence id="1123">But everybody already knows a language so that the experiment was not feasible until one day I read in a book called the Biological Foundations of Language that deaf children, before they go to <span class="building">school</span> don't know any language. </sentence><sentence id="1124">So I decided ah ha, that's my, those are going to be my subject. </sentence><sentence id="1125">Just about this time there was a letter published in the <span class="building">Vancouver newspaper</span> in response to an article which I had not seen. </sentence><sentence id="1126">But the writer wrote that so and so, a deaf man has a little deaf girl, he and his wife are deaf. </sentence><sentence id="1127">And have a deaf girl who was two years old and she has a vocabulary of, maybe she was two and a half, of several hundred signs which she combines in two word sentences. </sentence><sentence id="1128">Two sign sentences. </sentence><sentence id="1129">This was exciting because that's what hearing children in whatever language they learn. </sentence><sentence id="1130">So I contacted the writer of the letter. </sentence><sentence id="1131">He was a director of <span class="building">social welfare agency</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1132">And we talked and I also met a deaf man there. </sentence><sentence id="1133">He introduced me to this deaf man he was writing about who I don't remember how we talked, having a long conversation. </sentence><sentence id="1134">And it became clear to me that if you're deaf and you grow up in a <span class="dlf">deaf environment</span>, namely <span class="building">deaf residential schools</span>, that it's very similar to being Jewish. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1207">Q: Why do you say that? </sentence><sentence id="1208"> https://collections.ushmm.org </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1211"> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Harry Interview Markowicz 26 May 16, 2012 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1212">A: Because you are in a minority and you're part of a larger society but you're always a minority. </sentence><sentence id="1213">And the kind of relationships that develop among deaf people are the same kind of relationships you have among Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="1214">For example, a deaf American and a deaf Japanese may have more in common than a deaf American and a hearing American in some ways. </sentence><sentence id="1215">There's a language aspect. </sentence><sentence id="1216">There's a whole lot of, though later in my life I started writing about the community, the deaf community as an ethnic group. </sentence><sentence id="1217">Anyway this became very fascinating for me. </sentence><sentence id="1218">I got hooked. </sentence><sentence id="1219">So I started reading books related to deafness and either the books didn't mention sign language or else they denigrated it by saying it's not a real language because it doesn't have articles. </sentence><sentence id="1220">And it doesn't have a passive voice which is pure nonsense. </sentence><sentence id="1221">There are plenty of languages that don't have articles or a passive voice, not a requirement for that to be a language. </sentence><sentence id="1222">So that immediately got a rise out of me and the director of this institute for the deaf told me about a professor at <span class="building">Gallaudet University</span>, William Stokoe who had worked on sign language. </sentence><sentence id="1223">And suggested I contact him. </sentence><sentence id="1224">So I did. </sentence><sentence id="1225">And immediately Stokoe sent me back books, several books that he had written on sign language. </sentence><sentence id="1226">So I, with my masters papers on sign language. </sentence><sentence id="1227">This was in 1969, 70 at a time when sign language was not really accepted in <span class="country">America</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1228">So I -- it was a cause. </sentence><sentence id="1229">It was not my cause. </sentence><sentence id="1230">I couldn't, I couldn't fight for my cause, whatever that would be but I found that I wanted to take part in this fight for recognition of sign language and I could see eventually that it has to do with deaf civil rights. </sentence><sentence id="1231">So that's what I did, get involved in. </sentence><sentence id="1232">Eventually in what year was that. </sentence><sentence id="1233">In 72 I came to <span class="populated place">Washington</span> to go to <span class="populated place">Georgetown</span> to work on my PhD at the suggestion of Bill Stokoe. </sentence><sentence id="1234">And so I studied at <span class="populated place">Georgetown</span> and then I started working at <span class="building">Gallaudet</span> in William Stokoe's <span class="building">linguistic research lab</span> where he did research on sign language. </sentence><sentence id="1235">And it was funded by various grants, National Science Foundation and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1236">When the money started running out, I was no longer working there. </sentence><sentence id="1237">I worked there three years. </sentence><sentence id="1238">And I had gone to <span class="populated place">Paris</span> during the summer of 75 with several colleagues from <span class="populated place">Gallaudet</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1239">One in particular had a grant from maybe it was National Science, no it was National Endowment for the Humanities, a grant to study the historical foundation of American Sign Language, but its origins are from French sign language. </sentence><sentence id="1240">So I was the French expert. </sentence><sentence id="1241">My task was to go into the <span class="building">library</span> at the <span class="building">school</span> for the <span class="building">Humane school for the deaf</span> in <span class="populated place">Paris</span> and do research there on what was available on French sign language. </sentence><sentence id="1242"> https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Harry Interview Markowicz 27 May 16, 2012 There I met a sociologist who had some interest in deafness. </sentence><sentence id="1243">And then he knew the history of, this history of deafness, the controversy. </sentence><sentence id="1244">But he felt that all, he had been led to believe that with the new kind of hearing aids that were developed that that was not the problem anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1245">And so we got involved and he invited me to stay with him and I told him what I knew that. </sentence><sentence id="1246">So he, next, the next summer there was the world congress of the deaf took place in <span class="populated place">Washington</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1247">It takes place every four years. </sentence><sentence id="1248">He came here and then stayed afterwards with me and saw what we were doing in the <span class="building">linguistic research lab</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1249">And then he asked me if I would like to go back to <span class="country">France</span>, work with him, to get French sign language recognized in <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1250">So I took a year. </sentence><sentence id="1251">He got a grant there. </sentence><sentence id="1252">And went to <span class="populated place">Paris</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1253">That was 76. </sentence><sentence id="1254">Fall of 76. </sentence><sentence id="1255">And the year stretched to five years. </sentence><sentence id="1256">And in the meantime, after the first year I got married to my current wife Arlene who I knew already from <span class="populated
