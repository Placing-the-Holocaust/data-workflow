<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1">Q:Now, we'd like you to tell us your name and where you were born. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3">A:My name is Emanuel Mandel. </sentence><sentence id="4">I was born in <span class="populated place">Riga</span> in the country of <span class="country">Latvia</span> in 1936. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7">Q:1936. </sentence><sentence id="8">And you've said that where you were born is not really important to the story, so would you describe your family and perhaps your earliest memories. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="11">A:I said that it is not important to my story because uh there was an old adage that said you must be born where your mother is, and she was in <span class="populated place">Riga</span> at the time because my father had a position in <span class="country">Latvia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="12">As a matter of fact, he was about to leave <span class="country">Latvia</span> to go to <span class="country">Hungary</span> and they were just waiting for me to arrive, and when I was, I'm told, perhaps three months old or so, I left <span class="populated place">Riga</span> and never to return. </sentence><sentence id="13">I've never been there since. </sentence><sentence id="14">I would say that my earliest recollections are probably three or four years later. </sentence><sentence id="15">Uh, and none of them are in <span class="country">Latvia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="16">They are later on in <span class="country">Hungary</span> and places further. </sentence><sentence id="17">As we moved, as the war came, other recollections come up in other <span class="country">countries</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="25">Q:Well, let's start at your earliest recollections, and describe your family. </sentence><sentence id="26">What, who, who made up your family and where did you live? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="29">A:My family consisted at the time of, a small family, I'm an only child. </sentence><sentence id="30">Uh, my parents had a son before I was born, some three years before, who was born healthy according to the pediatrics of the time and at the age of ten weeks died, probably from some problem that in this day This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="31">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="32"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection and age could have been handled uh very simply in any <span class="building">hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="33">But that was 1933 and even though they were in major <span class="populated place">cities</span> with major medical knowledge available, it could not save the child. </sentence><sentence id="34">I came in 1936 and I was the only child to my mother and father. </sentence><sentence id="35">Uh, to, to flesh out in a sense the information about them, my father is alive and well, lives in the city of <span class="populated place">Philadelphia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="36">He is 85, just turned 85 this year. </sentence><sentence id="37">My mother died uh in 1967 in <span class="populated place">Philadelphia</span> of causes unrelated to anything else. </sentence><sentence id="38">It was a disease and uh, she died quickly, at a rather young age, just under 60. </sentence><sentence id="39">I, uh, as I say, since I have no siblings, the family is kind of limited. </sentence><sentence id="40">If I were to give you background about the family itself, uh my father comes from a <span class="populated place">city</span>, not a <span class="populated place">city</span>, a <span class="populated place">village</span>, a small <span class="populated place">village</span>, which was, at the time that he was born in 1904, in <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>, maybe <span class="country">Rumania</span>, or maybe even <span class="country">Hungary</span>, because the way the <span class="dlf">borders</span> were moved at the time nobody really knew. </sentence><sentence id="41">His passport was Czech. </sentence><sentence id="42">His citizenship was <span class="country">Czech</span>. </sentence><sentence id="43">The part of the <span class="region">land</span> was part of <span class="country">Austro-Hungary</span>, and his language is Hungarian, so it is difficult to determine. </sentence><sentence id="44">Legally, he was Czech. </sentence><sentence id="45">He served in the Czech Army and when he was 19 or 20 years old. </sentence><sentence id="46">But he never identified as a Czech. </sentence><sentence id="47">There's a document that I gave a copy of a little while ago, which is a Czech passport, which was, uh the pictures in the document are probably from 1939, 1940. </sentence><sentence id="48">I'm a young child but I'm still a Czech citizen on my father's papers. </sentence><sentence id="49">My father was raised in that general <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span> which is in...east of <span class="country">Hungary</span>--in <span class="populated place">Ruthenia</span> today. </sentence><sentence id="50">Today it's in <span class="populated place">Rumania</span>, as a matter of fact; so it's moved again. </sentence><sentence id="51">But he was raised there; and his travels took him to many places, but maybe you'll want to come back to that. </sentence><sentence id="52">My mother is from another part of the <span class="region">Austro-Hungary empire</span>, that part of <span class="country">Hungary</span> which was really Yugoslav. </sentence><sentence id="53">She's from a <span class="populated place">city</span> in <span class="region">southern Hungary</span> which today is <span class="country">Yugoslavia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="54">And just to indicate the confusion, it had three names - one in <span class="country">Serb</span>, one in <span class="country">Hungarian</span>, and one in German. </sentence><sentence id="55">And people wouldn't know how to refer to these <span class="populated place">communities</span>--whether you called them <span class="populated place">Ujvidek</span> in Hungarian, or <span class="populated place">Neusatz</span> in German, or <span class="populated place">Novi Sad</span> in Serb. </sentence><sentence id="56">She was raised there, in a family of uh six children, three boys and three This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="57">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="58"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection girls, and my father met her in that <span class="populated place">city</span> and again we may want to come to his story, at least parts of it, as you want to pursue that. </sentence><sentence id="59">But . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="94">Q:Why don't you tell it to us? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="96"> Azl'd be glad to. </sentence><sentence id="97">Well, uh, my father was educated in <span class="populated place">Vienna</span> and other places and eventually took a position in the <span class="populated place">city</span> of <span class="populated place">Novi Sad</span> where my mother lived, met her and they married and from there they moved to <span class="populated place">Riga</span> to another position my father had, and that's why I was born in <span class="populated place">Riga</span>. </sentence><sentence id="98">From there he went to <span class="country">Hungary</span> which was something he wanted to do all his life, but the pattern of migration at that time was by choice, well, semi-choice. </sentence><sentence id="99">He wanted to do this because he was trying to get to a certain particular position in his life, but he also was constrained from getting to <span class="country">Hungary</span> until 1940, uh, 1936, because as a Czech citizen, we go back to the old Czech citizenship, he could get no, he could not receive working papers or whatever permission to work in <span class="country">Hungary</span>, as a Czech citizen. </sentence><sentence id="100">In "36 he received it, so he went from part of <span class="country">Hungary</span>, back to <span class="country">Hungary</span>, after all these various detours, in <span class="country">Yugoslavia</span>, in <span class="country">Latvia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="101">If that's confusing, I can understand. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="108">Q: What was his position? </sentence><sentence id="109">What was his work? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="112">A:My father was a cantor. </sentence><sentence id="113">My father was a cantor in a <span class="building">synagogue</span> and has been that all his life. </sentence><sentence id="114">And he had positions in major congregations in <span class="populated place">Riga</span> and in <span class="populated place">Budapest</span> and in <span class="populated place">Novi Sad</span> and in <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>. </sentence><sentence id="115">And later on in <span class="country">Israel</span> and in <span class="populated place">New York</span> and in <span class="populated place">Philadelphia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="116">And in order to be able to move in his own <span class="dlf">field</span>, he had certain positions that he wanted to reach. </sentence><sentence id="117">And a cantor in the <span class="populated place">city</span> of <span class="populated place">Budapest</span>, in the <span class="building">synagogue</span> that held 3500 seats with a choir of 40 people, was a major position, and he wanted that position. </sentence><sentence id="118">But he didn't have permission to go there until This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="119">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="120"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection "36. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="132">Q:Why not? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="134">A:He was a Czech citizen. </sentence><sentence id="135">And the Czech citizens were not given Hungarian working papers. </sentence><sentence id="136">So the pattern of migration was not because he was either a Jew or because he, the war came. </sentence><sentence id="137">This was before that. </sentence><sentence id="138">There may have been some overtones of that, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="139">But very legally he was not permitted to get papers until "36 at which point he did assume the position of being one of the chief cantors of the <span class="populated place">city</span> of <span class="populated place">Budapest</span>, which was a major <span class="building">Jewish community center</span> in <span class="region">central Europe</span> at that time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="146">Q:Are you aware of any changes in your family's life when Hitler came to power? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="148">A: Well, "Hitler came to power" needs to be addressed in terms of when - whether when he came to power in <span class="country">Germany</span>, or as his power began to reach out throughout <span class="country">Europe</span>. </sentence><sentence id="149">And what time are you talking about? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="152">Q:Whenever it affected you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="154">A:Sure. </sentence><sentence id="155">Hitler comes to power in <span class="country">Germany</span> and the laws, the various laws that are passed, the uh... I think there's a term called "Numerus Clausus." </sentence><sentence id="156">These various enumerated clauses that were passed to restrict certain life began way back probably in 1933. </sentence><sentence id="157">And they came, as history indicates, it's not germane to my particular story - it's available in lots of papers - that most of what happened was very legal, very correct, and did everything according to the rules. </sentence><sentence id="158">Now, if you want recollections from me for example, I know that uh one day, this was in <span class="country">Hungary</span>, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="159">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="160"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection in <span class="populated place">Budapest</span>, the capital of the <span class="country">country</span>, in a very lovely <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, a large <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, on the <span class="interior space">fifth floor</span> of the <span class="building">building</span> where I had lived which I recall quite clearly. </sentence><sentence id="161">As a matter of fact, for the first time in forty some years I visited it last year. </sentence><sentence id="162">My wife and I went to <span class="country">Hungary</span> and we went to the <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="163">Didn't go in because I didn't want to bother the people and there was nobody <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="164">So the <span class="building">building</span> is now probably 80 or 90 years old - it's in reasonable shape. </sentence><sentence id="165">But in 1940 or so, 1938, it was a very lovely <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="166">And I remember that one day, I can't tell you which year, but some place in that general period, in "39, "40, "41, a telephone installer came in and said that he must take the <span class="spatial object">telephone</span> away. </sentence><sentence id="167">And I remember asking why, whether I asked him or my parents I don't recall. </sentence><sentence id="168">He said Jews may not have <span class="spatial object">telephones</span>. </sentence><sentence id="169">Period. </sentence><sentence id="170">Another incident. </sentence><sentence id="171">Uh, we had a maid, a live-in-maid - there was a maid's quarters in the <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, that was very usual in those days, in those circumstances, and uh, she was told she could no longer be with us. </sentence><sentence id="172">She wanted to take me with her to her <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="173">My parents thought about it, chose not to do that. </sentence><sentence id="174">But maids could not be employed by Jews. </sentence><sentence id="175">So the maid left. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="200">Q:Why would she have taken you to her <span class="populated place">village</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="202">A:Well, she thought she would in some way help me. </sentence><sentence id="203">Or maybe save me, or maybe protect me, or maybe help me, or raise me in a sense, because there were overtones of problems. </sentence><sentence id="204">Uh, I recall rather clearly that as a child of 5 or 6 or so I wanted a <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span>. </sentence><sentence id="205">Not an unusual request, a <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> for a child of 5 or 6. </sentence><sentence id="206">My parents were certainly in a position to afford a <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> or five. </sentence><sentence id="207">But there was major concern. </sentence><sentence id="208">I didn't understand the concern at the time. </sentence><sentence id="209">I just understood I didn't have a <span class="spatial object">bike</span>. </sentence><sentence id="210">And I probably threw the normal 5-year-old-tantrums about it. </sentence><sentence id="211">Later on I kind of understood that one of the reasons was that in a <span class="populated place">city</span>, you ride <span class="spatial object">bicycles</span> in a <span class="dlf">park</span>, and in the <span class="populated place">city</span> of <span class="populated place">Budapest</span>, large, urbane, sophisticated as it was, if a child with a This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="212">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="213"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection yellow star on his chest rode a <span class="spatial object">bike</span>, somebody might have knocked him off the <span class="spatial object">bike</span>, taken the <span class="spatial object">bike</span> and left him on the <span class="dlf">curb</span>, and nobody really would have said too much. </sentence><sentence id="214">And my parents thought it was just unsafe. </sentence><sentence id="215">Not unsafe in terms of the kinds of problems you might have because of <span class="spatial object">traffic</span>, but just unsafe. </sentence><sentence id="216">I know that when I went to <span class="building">school</span>, the <span class="interior space">apartment</span> we had was on a corer of a <span class="building">building</span> - you could see down the <span class="dlf">street</span> if you stood in the <span class="interior space">bedroom</span>, there was a circular kind of a set of <span class="dlf">windows</span> - and the <span class="dlf">street</span> I lived on, my <span class="building">house</span> was number at 13, my <span class="building">school</span> was at number 44. </sentence><sentence id="217">You could see from the <span class="interior space">fifth floor</span> <span class="dlf">apartment window</span> at number 13 to number 44. </sentence><sentence id="218">You could almost see the <span class="building">school</span>, which was down the <span class="dlf">street</span> several <span class="dlf">blocks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="219">And I didn't know this but I was told that my father, for example, often would both watch me walk to <span class="building">school</span> and sometimes follow me walking to <span class="building">school</span> because of some safety concerns that the kid might be knocked into <span class="dlf">traffic</span>. </sentence><sentence id="220">Nobody would have necessarily said too much if a child age six or seven with a yellow star would be pushed into <span class="dlf">traffic</span>. </sentence><sentence id="221">Accidentally or deliberately by somebody who was trying to make an incident. </sentence><sentence id="222">These are certainly things that in some way affected my life as a child, and uh, hindsight is always perfect. </sentence><sentence id="223">Part of what I find fascinating in my own case is that I have very good recollections. </sentence><sentence id="224">But the time that this took place I didn't have the emotional impact of what this meant. </sentence><sentence id="225">I learned that later. </sentence><sentence id="226">A six year old doesn't understand political realities, doesn't understand various kinds of anti- this or anti- that. </sentence><sentence id="227">Uh, to a 6 year old, in a rather peculiar way, wearing a yellow star makes him an adult." </sentence><sentence id="228">All the adults do. " </sentence><sentence id="229">Well, if they do and I don't, I'm a child. </sentence><sentence id="230">If they do and I do, I'm an adult." </sentence><sentence id="231">There's a certain badge of honor. </sentence><sentence id="232">They didn't understand the negative implications of that. </sentence><sentence id="233">To me, to be like an adult, I too have my own yellow star. </sentence><sentence id="234">It was an important achievement, of sorts. </sentence><sentence id="235">That sounds silly. </sentence><sentence id="236">But we are talking about a 6-year old child. </sentence><sentence id="237"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="276">Q:Do you remember when you got your yellow star? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="278">A:The specific day, no. </sentence><sentence id="279">But it must have been some time in uh ... Well, <span class="country">Hungary</span> was in a peculiar position. </sentence><sentence id="280"><span class="country">Hungary</span>, being an ally of <span class="country">Germany</span>, was not overrun. </sentence><sentence id="281">I am reasonably certain that the reason I'm alive today is because I was not under German rule in 1939. </sentence><sentence id="282">Now, the Hungarian Nazi Party, known as the <span class="building">Arrow Cross</span>, was not what I would call benevolent. </sentence><sentence id="283">On the other hand... Shall we stop? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="290">Q:We're going to have to stop. </sentence><sentence id="291">I'm sorry. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="294">A:I didn't want to pay attention to the flicker; but I figured when it went out, might as well stop. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="296">Q:Let's do this as quickly as we can. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="298">A:Anything you want to say while we're off for a minute in terms of where we are? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="300">Q:This is very interesting and important and exactly what we want to have on the tape. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="302">A:Well, is this the way you want to have it? </sentence><sentence id="303">I have another variation, another canned speech, although some of it is. </sentence><sentence id="304">I mean, I've done this before. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="308">Q:...breathing in my ear to tell you that she's terrific. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="310">A:Well, I know that. </sentence><sentence id="311">Come on! </sentence><sentence id="312">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="313">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="314"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="320">Q:Go. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="322">A:I was commenting on the fact that one of the--if you want to call it an advantage, or one of the blessings in disguise--was that <span class="country">Hungary</span> was not occupied by the Germans until fairly late in the war. </sentence><sentence id="323"><span class="country">Hungary</span> was an ally. </sentence><sentence id="324">Again, historians know that the region of <span class="country">Hungary</span> was uh, struck some kind of ally pact with Hitler and they were allies, so Hungarian troops on the <span class="region">Russian front</span> and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="325">As a consequence, the German presence, the physical presence of the Germans, specifically the SS and the Gestapo, did not enter <span class="country">Hungary</span> until very late in the war. </sentence><sentence id="326">Literally until 1944. </sentence><sentence id="327">Earlier, the regime was run by the Hungarian Nazi Party--the so- called "Arrow Cross," the <span class="building">Nylas</span>. </sentence><sentence id="328">And their symbol was crossed arrows, as opposed to the swastika that the Germans had. </sentence><sentence id="329">And as a consequence, the kind of life that one had was probably different. </sentence><sentence id="330">I'm not sure it was any better; but life was certainly different than it would have been under German occupation. </sentence></p></dialogue>
