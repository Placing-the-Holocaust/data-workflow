and the Jews had to have yellow, a star, this, Stars of David, and they also had to walk in the <span class="dlf">gutter</span>. </sentence><sentence id="167">So it took us a few hours and | was walking with my sister on the <span class="dlf">street</span> like two little Polish girls. </sentence><sentence id="168">And when my aunt saw us, she thought that we came from the other <span class="region">side</span>, who know what. </sentence><sentence id="169">Of course, she was very, very happy and we were in <span class="populated place">Vilna</span>. </sentence><sentence id="170">A few days later, my father came. </sentence><sentence id="171">And my father, from all the aggravation of everything, became ill and had a very big abscess. </sentence><sentence id="172">And also, in <span class="populated place">Vilna</span>, the Jews were persecuted like subhumans. </sentence><sentence id="173">Every day, new edicts were coming. </sentence><sentence id="174">We couldn't have a radio, we couldn't have a jewelry, we couldn't have a watch, we couldn't have properties, we couldn't talk to gentiles. </sentence><sentence id="175">| mean, we were plain ostracizes. </sentence><sentence id="176">And every day they used to come and take out men and young boys and they used to disappear and the women never knew where they were and what was done to these young . </sentence><sentence id="177">One of my uncles, my mother's sister's husband, was taken from the <span class="dlf">street</span>, he was standing and reading an edict, he was taken from the <span class="dlf">street</span> and she never saw him again. </sentence><sentence id="178">So the situation was very, very tense and my father was very ill and he was afraid to go out in the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="179">But once he became so ill and the abscess that he had was so big that during the night, he decided that he had to go, so my uncle and my aunt took him by the hand and they were walking in the middle of the night, they took him to a <span class="building">hospital</span> that was in the <span class="region">Jewish section</span>, it was a <span class="building">Jewish hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="180">And he was staying there. </sentence><sentence id="181">And my other uncle no, never went out. </sentence><sentence

that an edict came that all the Jews have to go to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="184">But it was such a diabolic, diabolic plan, a master plan, the way they did it. </sentence><sentence id="185">There was, as | told you, there was a section, a <span class="interior space">Jewish section</span> in the heart of <span class="populated place">Vilna</span>, a very, very cultural <span class="populated place">town</span> that had a lot of <span class="building">theaters</span>, <span class="building">archives</span> and <span class="building">museums</span> and it had, and Jewish, very rich Jewish life with <span class="building">libraries</span> and all kinds of societies and charitable organization. </sentence><sentence id="186">And there were a lot of

id="188">In the heart of <span class="populated place">Vilna</span> was a <span class="region">section</span> where very poor Jews lived, it was in very bad conditions. </sentence><sentence

</sentence><sentence id="194">| still remember her yelling and screaming and crying after the children that she lost there, after the family. </sentence><sentence id="195">So it was, a very diabolic plan how to do it. </sentence><sentence id="196">When we were told to go to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, they came, everything was done early in the morning, and my uncle, Yosef(ph) Perski(ph), said to my aunt, "Look, | am not going to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>". </sentence><sentence id="197">He was, had a very big advantage, he doesn't look Jewish, he look like a gentile, he look like a Pole and he was a business man that had a lot of connections with Polish peasants. </sentence><sentence id="198">He was buying wood there from them and also dried mushrooms, he says, "| am going there and | want you to go with me". </sentence><sentence id="199">She says, she, my aunt Sonja, who was like a second mother to us, said to him, "I promised my sister on her <span class="spatial object">death bed</span> that | am, be a second mother and | will take care of those two little girls, Lilla(ph) and Rhya(ph)," this was how we were called, "And | won't leave them alone". </sentence><sentence id="200">We didn't know about it. </sentence><sentence id="201">So they kissed and he sneaked out and he went. </sentence><sentence id="202">We never

<span class="populated place">ghetto</span>", because they really were rejoicing what was happening to us. </sentence><sentence id="206">There were two <span class="populated place">ghettos</span> and
