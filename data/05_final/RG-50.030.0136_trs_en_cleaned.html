<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4">Q: All right. </sentence><sentence id="5">Would you -- sorry about that. </sentence><sentence id="6">Would you tell me your name, full name, again, please? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="10">A: My full name is Simone Marguerite Lipman. </sentence><sentence id="11">My maiden name was Weil -- W-E-I-L.Simone Weil. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="15">Q: Where and when were you born? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="17">A: I was actually born in a very little <span class="populated place">village</span> in <span class="region">Alsace</span>, near <span class="populated place">Strasbourg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="18">I was born on April 22nd, 1920. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="21">Q: And what was the name of the <span class="populated place">village</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="23">A: The name of the <span class="populated place">village</span> was <span class="populated place">Ringendorf</span>. </sentence><sentence id="24">In spite of the fact that it was so small that it didn't even fit on the -- doesn't appear on most maps, it had a <span class="building">Jewish community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="25">It had a <span class="building">synagogue</span> which, of course, was destroyed during the war. </sentence><sentence id="26">And I -- the <span class="building">house</span> in which I was born is in shambles, but it's still there. </sentence><sentence id="27">My family moved to <span class="populated place">Strasbourg</span> in -- when I was three years old. </sentence><sentence id="28">My father was a sheep raiser, a very unusual kind of a profession for -- occupation for a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="29">His father, whom I never knew, was a butcher. </sentence><sentence id="30">They're all family of Jewish butchers, but he broke out of there, "though he had barely, probably, a sixth grade education, and he became one of the most prominent sheep-breeders in the <span class="region">east</span>. </sentence><sentence id="31">So I grew up in <span class="populated place">Strasbourg</span>, which was a vibrant, vibrant and dynamic, Jewish community. </sentence><sentence id="32">I have a brother -- I should say, I had a brother, because he died some 14 years ago after loosing his son in the Yom Kippur War in <span class="country">Israel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="33">My brother was just a year younger than myself, and both of us were very active in, in the Jewish youth movement, which were the Jewish scouting movement, Les Eclaireurs Israelites de France. </sentence><sentence id="34">Les "EIF," as we called them. </sentence><sentence id="35">And I'm going to refer to them many times in this hour to come. </sentence><sentence id="36">I also got a very solid Jewish education there -- very unusual for girls my age. </sentence><sentence id="37">I went to <span class="building">Talmud Torah</span> all through my <span class="building">high school</span>, and was very active in things Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="38">And particularly, as I said, in the Jewish youth movement, the scouts, where I was a leader and had leadership training. </sentence><sentence id="39">I went into the <span class="building">lycee</span>," like all kids my age. </sentence><sentence id="40">I got a good classical education, I suppose. </sentence><sentence id="41">In those days, it was the typical classical education: studying Latin and Greek and philosophy, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="42">But when I finished <span class="building">high school</span> and got my baccalaureate in 1938, I wanted to become a physicist. </sentence><sentence id="43">But somehow I was talked out of it, because the writing was on the <span class="dlf">wall</span>, and somehow was told that was not a thing to do for a Jewish girl, and that it would be better in -- to go into something more practical. </sentence><sentence id="44">And so I went into early childhood education, and I'm stuck. </sentence><sentence id="45">I mean, I never moved away from that. </sentence><sentence id="46">So I got one year of training, and that's all. </sentence><sentence id="47"> But already in 1938, while the Munich Agreements and the debates were going on, my parents sent me to safety with my grandmother -- then very close to 80. </sentence><sentence id="48">And I went somewhere in the south of <span class="country">France</span> with her for just a short period. </sentence><sentence id="49">Then things calmed down again and I went back to <span class="populated place">Strasbourg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="50">And we stayed in <span class="populated place">Strasbourg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="51">By 19 -- by the end of the summer 1939, of course, we knew war was coming. </sentence><sentence id="52">And again, I was shipped to the center of <span class="country">France</span> with my grandmother. </sentence><sentence id="53">I was eighteen years old. </sentence><sentence id="54">But the safety of my grandmother was utmost. </sentence><sentence id="55">That was my ma -- paternal grandmother, lived with us. </sentence><sentence id="56">And I was sent down <span class="region">south</span> to take care of her. </sentence><sentence id="57">In the meanwhile, <span class="populated place">Strasbourg</span>, which was the most -- considered the most exposed <span class="populated place">city</span> of <span class="country">France</span> in spite of the <span class="dlf">Maginot Line</span> -- was completely evacuated. </sentence><sentence id="58">All the population of <span class="populated place">Strasbourg</span> was evacuated and sent down to the to the <span class="dlf">Perigeaux</span>, to the <span class="region">Department of the Dordogne</span>. </sentence><sentence id="59">But somehow, because my parents had their own private means, they did not join the flow of refugees going down <span class="region">south</span> and they went near <span class="populated place">Nancy</span>, where they rented a <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="60">Now, here I am <span class="region">south</span> with my grandmother and -- when things settled down. </sentence><sentence id="61">But because you had relatives, somehow it was they were able to get in touch with me. </sentence><sentence id="62">And so I returned to <span class="populated place">Blamont</span>, where my parents were living, with my grandmother. </sentence><sentence id="63">And there we were waiting for the war to finish. </sentence><sentence id="64">We had just with us whatever we needed. </sentence><sentence id="65">And when the winter came, we needed some more clothes. </sentence><sentence id="66">And I remember to this day, going with a "safe- conduct" -- that what you call it? </sentence><sentence id="67">A "sauf-conduit. </sentence><sentence id="68">"(r) And we went into <span class="populated place">Strasbourg</span>, my brother and I. It was a <span class="populated place">ghost town</span> with just cats and dogs in there, and we got some winter clothes and went back to <span class="populated place">Blamont</span>. </sentence><sentence id="69">In the meanwhile, I took a job in <span class="populated place">Paris</span>, in, in a <span class="building">private school</span>, to -- because I had had some training in early childhood education. </sentence><sentence id="70">And I worked there, while the <span class="spatial object">bombs</span>, the bombings were starting, and taught in the <span class="building">shelters</span>, and so forth and so on. </sentence><sentence id="71">But that lasted a very short period, because my mother took sick, and I returned to <span class="populated place">Blamont</span> in the spring of 1940, just in time for the invasion. </sentence><sentence id="72">And so we were in -- | think the invasion is four -- the fifth or sixth of May 1940. </sentence><sentence id="73">My very religious family had prepared everything for Shabbat, and the first time in their life, they had to take to the <span class="dlf">road</span> on the Shabbat. </sentence><sentence id="74">And here we were, loading as much as we could in a <span class="spatial object">car</span> and taking off direction unknown, because the Germans were -- had crossed over. </sentence><sentence id="75">Coming through <span class="country">Belgium</span>, <span class="country">Holland</span>, and crossing over. </sentence><sentence id="76">And we were very close to the <span class="dlf">border</span>, so we left. </sentence><sentence id="77">As a matter of fact, a neighbor of ours had a <span class="spatial object">car</span>. </sentence><sentence id="78">Was a crippled lady and her daughter. </sentence><sentence id="79">And nobody to drive the <span class="spatial object">car</span>. </sentence><sentence id="80">And I had had two lessons in driving, so I took the wheel, and followed my brother with... And we drove for five days and five nights. </sentence><sentence id="81">We drove with the bombings going on. </sentence><sentence id="82">These were convoys of people just carrying with them whatever they could. </sentence><sentence id="83">We were fortunate we always find a <span class="interior space">room</span> for my grandmother. </sentence><sentence id="84">But anyway, we ended up in the somewhere near <span class="populated place">Vichy</span>, of all places, and we heard that <span class="country">France</span> had surrendered. </sentence><sentence id="85">This was June 6th, 1940. </sentence><sentence id="86">And here we were. </sentence><sentence id="87">Couldn't go any back. </sentence><sentence id="88">Couldn't go any forward. </sentence><sentence id="89">So we stopped. </sentence><sentence id="90">And we waited to see what would happen. </sentence><sentence id="91">What would happen was that all the Jews from <span class="region">Alsace</span> were expelled because <span class="country">France</span> was divided into two <span class="region">zones</span>: the <span class="region">northern  part</span> and the <span class="region">southern part</span>, with a <span class="dlf">demarcation line</span> in between. </sentence><sentence id="92">But Alsace and <span class="region">Lorraine</span> were annexed, and became <span class="country">Germany</span> -- became German right away. </sentence><sentence id="93">Like they had done so many times before -- before the World War IL, before World War I, and...and so on. </sentence><sentence id="94">And so all the Jews from <span class="region">Alsace</span> were expelled. </sentence><sentence id="95">And relatives were ma -- were coming down over the <span class="dlf">demarcation line</span>. </sentence><sentence id="96">And my father and my brother managed to find a <span class="dlf">farm</span>, that is where -- the <span class="building">house</span> of a guard, in a big <span class="building">chateau</span> in the southwest of <span class="country">France</span> in <span class="populated place">Perigeaux</span>, in the <span class="region">free zone</span>. </sentence><sentence id="97">And that's where my family settled for the rest of the war.there were, there was -- there were my parents, my grandmother, my brother, myself; and then two uncles, two aunts, two cousins and two German men who had come -- had escaped from the -- from <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="98">And we took them on...on the <span class="dlf">farm</span>. </sentence><sentence id="99">One of my great guilts about that period is that I wasn't -- I didn't know what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="100">We were -- we felt safe in this <span class="dlf">farm</span>, where we were going to wait. </sentence><sentence id="101">We were going to have food. </sentence><sentence id="102">And I really didn't know what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="103">And my family was not very new, were not -- wasn't oriented to this kind of thing. </sentence><sentence id="104">And I was -- we were surviving there. </sentence><sentence id="105">I was milking the cows, literally. </sentence><sentence id="106">One morning the gendarme* came -- the French police, the French gendarme -- and asked for our two German men. </sentence><sentence id="107">They were rounding them up. </sentence><sentence id="108">And I was so unaware of what was going on that I went to call them. </sentence><sentence id="109">But one was smart enough, aware enough, to jump out of the back in the <span class="env feature">woods</span> and disappear. </sentence><sentence id="110">And the other one, of course, they took along. </sentence><sentence id="111">To this day I don't know what happened to him. </sentence><sentence id="112">The Jews had to register in the south of -- we never had to wear the, the star in the south of <span class="country">France</span>, but as Jews we all had to register with the Commisariat aux Affaires Juives*-- the, the special office for Jews. </sentence><sentence id="113">And my parents registered. </sentence><sentence id="114">I suppose I did, too, although I don't remember that particularly. </sentence><sentence id="115">But somehow during this first year there, I got a call -- I got a, I got a letter. </sentence><sentence id="116">I think it was a letter. </sentence><sentence id="117">I don't think we had a <span class="spatial object">phone</span>. </sentence><sentence id="118">Certainly we had no <span class="spatial object">transportation</span>. </sentence><sentence id="119">We had no <span class="spatial object">phone</span>. </sentence><sentence id="120">And I got a call from one of my former leaders in the Jewish scouting movement. </sentence><sentence id="121">And I'm going to mention her name, because she's so well known: Andree Salomon is known by everybody for her incredible work that she has done in rescuing Jewish children during the war. </sentence><sentence id="122">And had already started doing so in <span class="populated place">Strasbourg</span>, when all -- when German Jewish parents started to send children across the <span class="dlf">border</span> for us to... And they were placed in families throughout <span class="region">Alsace</span>. </sentence><sentence id="123">And Andree was already the person to take care of them, and to, to see to their safety. </sentence><sentence id="124">How she got in touch with me, I will never know because unfortunately she died a few years ago, before I ever really cleared this up. </sentence><sentence id="125">But she said they -- I was needed in one of the <span class="populated place">camps</span>, and explained the situation. </sentence><sentence id="126">And this is the first time I knew about <span class="populated place">camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="127">And to this day, it's a great guilt that I carry, that I didn't know about these <span class="populated place">camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="128">But I packed and I left. </sentence><sentence id="129">Not very much support from my family. </sentence><sentence id="130">I was very distressed because my mother was not terribly well, had taken very hardly all these changes in leaving <span class="populated place">Strasbourg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="131">But I left. </sentence><sentence id="132">Of  course, there were plenty of people on the <span class="dlf">farm</span>. </sentence><sentence id="133">And I, and I just packed my things, and I went to <span class="populated place">Rivesaltes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="134">Now, I don't know if you want me to go into any explanation as to what <span class="populated place">Rivesaltes</span> was. </sentence><sentence id="135">I'm sure you know about <span class="populated place">Rivesaltes</span>, but I didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="136">And I went there, and became a resident -- a worker for OSE.deg At that time, OSE had -- of course, Madame Salomon sent them over to there -- another worker, Vivette, and a doctor, Doctor Malkin. </sentence><sentence id="137">And then there were other organizations that, like the <span class="building">OSE</span>, had resident workers there. </sentence><sentence id="138">There was the Unitarians, the Quakers, the CIMADE," and a number of other <span class="building">rescue agencies</span> -- Secours Suisse,(r) particularly. </sentence><sentence id="139">The <span class="building">Swiss Relief Agen</span>... I'm not sure exactly what it was called. </sentence><sentence id="140">And the primary job of these <span class="building">agencies</span> was to help improve the conditions of the people there, because the <span class="populated place">camps</span> hygienic and physical conditions were beyond descriptions. </sentence><sentence id="141">The <span class="populated place">camp</span> was situated in an <span class="region">area</span> where what I remember mostly is the wind blowing -- this hot wind called "<span class="dlf">La Tramontane</span>,"" which, the people being so weak from malnutrition, they just rolled along with the wind. </sentence><sentence id="142">They couldn't, they couldn't walk in the <span class="env feature">wind</span>. </sentence><sentence id="143">Now, in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> there was still some Spanish refugees from the Franco wars, and in the <span class="populated place">camps</span> were all the Jews that had been deported from <span class="populated place">Rhineland</span>, from areas along the <span class="env feature">Rhine</span>, on the -- in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="144">Some of them had already been in <span class="populated place">Gurs</span>, another very infamous <span class="populated place">camp</span> in the southwest of <span class="country">France</span>, and transferred to <span class="populated place">Rivesaltes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="145">After a year of internment, they were in very weakened condition already. </sentence><sentence id="146">Because, although as I understand it the food that was provided was according to the Geneva Convention, but much of it disappeared on the <span class="building">black market</span>. </sentence><sentence id="147">In addition to which, there wasn't much food, period, in <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="148">And one of the jobs of <span class="building">OSE</span>, which was originally actually a <span class="building">medical social agency</span>, was to provide extra rations for the people. </sentence><sentence id="149">So that became one of the important tasks of <span class="building">OSE</span>, to distribute whatever it could. </sentence><sentence id="150">Some day it was milk from the <span class="populated place">Secours Suisse</span>. </sentence><sentence id="151">Sometimes it was dates. </sentence><sentence id="152">Sometimes it was a handful of olives. </sentence><sentence id="153">And always a little bread that we had to divide. </sentence><sentence id="154">I shall never forget entering into the <span class="building">barracks</span> and dividing the breads in eight pieces. </sentence><sentence id="155">And how can you make them exactly equal? </sentence><sentence id="156">So we put numbers of them, so that it was like a, a lottery for people to get the piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="157">So that no one would be slighted, because fights would erupt around the size of a piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="158">I remember handing a man in the <span class="building">barrack</span> a piece of bread and his just falling back. </sentence><sentence id="159">And he was dead. </sentence><sentence id="160">That was the condition of the adults. </sentence><sentence id="161">And, of course, the men lived in their own <span class="building">barracks</span>, and the women in their own. </sentence><sentence id="162"> And the children, we tried to keep them in special il6t'deg where we kept the children, and tried to provide as much as we could for them in terms of extras. </sentence><sentence id="163">A lot of little activities, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="164">My -- but the particular purpose for my going to <span class="populated place">Rivesaltes</span> was to take care of the children. </sentence><sentence id="165">Not so much the administrative work to which I'm going to come a little bit later. </sentence><sentence id="166">Oh, I did food rationing, this food ration distribution; but I took care of the children. </sentence><sentence id="167">I remember the first Saturday afternoon, Shabbat afternoon, we gathered. </sentence><sentence id="168">I had two hundred and eighty kids for one Oneg Shabbat."" </sentence><sentence id="169">And I've been trying to do something in one, one big <span class="building">barrack</span>. </sentence><sentence id="170">But there were wonderful people among the internees. </sentence><sentence id="171">There were some people who -- whose moral fiber was just such that they wanted to do something for the others. </sentence><sentence id="172">So there were teachers, there were rabbis, there were people who, who lent a hand. </sentence><sentence id="173">And we tried to provide whatever we could and -- with nothing. </sentence><sentence id="174">Singing, dancing --whatever we could. </sentence><sentence id="175">I also created some groups of girl scouts. </sentence><sentence id="176">I mean, girl scouts in a <span class="populated place">camp</span>! </sentence><sentence id="177">It sounds ridiculous when I think of it today, but that's all I knew in, in, in activities. </sentence><sentence id="178">So I created <span class="building">girl scouts</span>. </sentence><sentence id="179">But when I have the pictures to show you later, I had -- we organized activities. </sentence><sentence id="180">In the meanwhile, <span class="building">OSE</span> proceeded to get the liberation from the <span class="populated place">camp</span> of the children under 16.And some over 16 as well, because you could just work around that a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="181">The procedure is well-known today. </sentence><sentence id="182">I think that the way it was done it was that you could get the permissions through some very cooperating officials in the <span class="populated place">Department de Herault</span>, where <span class="populated place">Perpignan</span> was -- no -- in <span class="populated place">Herault</span>. </sentence><sentence id="183">Not in <span class="populated place">Perpignan</span>, in a neighboring <span class="populated place">Department</span>. </sentence><sentence id="184">To get the children into <span class="building">residence</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="185">And once they were there we could of course disperse them into the very number of <span class="building">children's home</span> that existed, that OSE had set up in the south of <span class="country">France</span> after having transferred the children from the <span class="building">children's homes</span> around <span class="populated place">Paris</span>. </sentence><sentence id="186">Because -- all right, I have to back-track a little bit there. </sentence><sentence id="187">OSE had already set children's <span class="building">home</span> up around <span class="populated place">Paris</span> in the late "30s for children who had come from <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="188">In fact, I had been offered a job in one of these <span class="building">homes</span> and instead went to work in <span class="populated place">Paris</span>. </sentence><sentence id="189">So we had all these children's <span class="building">home</span> existing there, and it was a an administrative procedure in trying to get these children out. </sentence><sentence id="190">But it was not only that. </sentence><sentence id="191">It was it was persuading the parents to let the children go. </sentence><sentence id="192">Mind you, at that time we had not -- deportations had not started yet there. </sentence><sentence id="193">They were still -- we are still in the early part of 1942 now. </sentence><sentence id="194">Yeah, we're still in the early part of 1942, and the deportations haven't started. </sentence><sentence id="195">But there were rumors of shipping the people off to <span class="populated place">labor camps</span> or <span class="populated place">resettlement camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="196">Far from us was any kind of idea of what -- where they were really sent. </sentence><sentence id="197">But <span class="building">OSE</span> had had the foresight, through some people like Andree Salomon and a doctor, Joseph Weill, to think of saving the children and getting them out. </sentence><sentence id="198">And at numerous occasion, I had opportunity to convoy children out or to take children out. </sentence><sentence id="199">I remember one particular group that sticks in my mind of all of it. </sentence><sentence id="200">We had a small group -- but sizeable enough -- of Down's Syndrome children in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="201">Very young, small Down's Sy -- and there was a place for them in <span class="populated place">Bergerac</span>, in the <span class="region">Dordogne</span>, and here we are on the <span class="env feature">Rivesaltes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="202">I mean, had to cross all the  south of <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="203">And I took these children by <span class="spatial object">train</span> to <span class="populated place">Bergerac</span>. </sentence><sentence id="204">There must have been five, six of them. </sentence><sentence id="205">These children had actually learned to walk in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, had never known how to take steps. </sentence><sentence id="206">And we get to the <span class="building">station</span>, and they didn't know how to go down or up <span class="dlf">stairs</span> because they had just never experienced this. </sentence><sentence id="207">In addition to which, they were -- had Down's Syndrome. </sentence><sentence id="208">But that's the one <span class="spatial object">convoy</span> I remember, of all of them. </sentence><sentence id="209">I'm not sure exactly why, but I remember this one more than anything else. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="402">A: I only remember that, that -- the <span class="dlf">steps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="403">What it was on the <span class="spatial object">train</span>, I really don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="404">I know I got them to safety in <span class="populated place">Bergerac</span>. </sentence><sentence id="405">What happened to them afterwards, I don't know, but we got them out. </sentence><sentence id="406">What I do remember very vividly is the deportations starting. </sentence><sentence id="407">And that was in August, I think, of August of "42. </sentence><sentence id="408">It was again a matter of sending people in <span class="populated place">work camps</span> -- to <span class="populated place">work camps</span>, or to <span class="populated place">resettlement camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="409">I think we should have known that that wasn't quite it, because they were rounding up. </sentence><sentence id="410">I can see this elderly woman on crutches, and I can see the young people and I can see the sick -- all being called out on this enormous empty <span class="interior space">space</span> in the camp of <span class="populated place">Rivesaltes</span> and crossing the <span class="dlf">line</span> over as their name was called. </sentence><sentence id="411">I also remember this very dignified young Rabbi, who would not hurry this woman on crutches, and walking over that empty <span class="interior space">space</span>. </sentence><sentence id="412">Now, I was very young. </sentence><sentence id="413">And I had learned a lot about humanity while I was in this <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="414">I learned a lot. [ </sentence><sentence id="415">remember one woman, and to this day I remember her name. </sentence><sentence id="416">Do you want her name? </sentence><sentence id="417">She was Madame Grynszpan. </sentence><sentence id="418">In fact, she was an aunt of the young Grynszpan who, who started things in Kristallnacht because he killed the attache in <span class="populated place">Paris</span>. </sentence><sentence id="419">And she was always -- in spite of the horrible conditions there, she managed to have a neat scarf on her head and lipstick on. </sentence><sentence id="420">And she says, "The day you are going to see me without my makeup, you know, that's the end for me." </sentence><sentence id="421">I know she escaped, because I -- one day I saw her on the <span class="building">train station</span> in <span class="populated place">Rivesaltes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="422">And, of course, I made no effort to acknowledge that I recognized her, because she had escaped, and so I know she escaped. </sentence><sentence id="423">So I -- one thing is that I had -- I learned so much from the, the, the dignity and some of the attitude of the people who were living under these horrible conditions. </sentence><sentence id="424">I was, I was very young, and, and it made a tremendous impression on me. </sentence><sentence id="425">I remember these first convoys. </sentence><sentence id="426">The <span class="spatial object">train</span> came to <span class="populated place">Rivesaltes</span>, to the <span class="dlf">tracks</span> there, and people were boarded. </sentence><sentence id="427">Now, I do not remember <span class="spatial object">cattle trains</span>. </sentence><sentence id="428">These were regular <span class="spatial object">trains</span>. </sentence><sentence id="429">But what I remember mostly, too, was during that period there were categories of people that could be deported and some who couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="430">There were still categories, because -- gosh, how naive we were -- and thought that it was going to continue. </sentence><sentence id="431">If you had been fighting in World War II on the Allied or some -- or in World War I, I should say that. </sentence><sentence id="432">If you had been born one, one parent, there were categories who were non-Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="433">Or if you had resided for that long in <span class="populated place">Paris</span>. </sentence><sentence id="434">So we scrambled for certificate from concierge to demonstrate that he had -- so and so had lived in <span class="populated place">Paris</span> for that period of time. </sentence><sentence id="435">We scrambled for all kinds of documents, sometimes falsifying them somewhat. </sentence><sentence id="436">And I remember, three of us -- I don't remember who the third one was. </sentence><sentence id="437">But I know was Jacqueline Levy, with whom I've discussed this very recently. </sentence><sentence id="438">We had all of a sudden, people were all in the <span class="spatial object">trains</span>. </sentence><sentence id="439">And we hadn't -- we had these papers to get twenty people out of, of the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="440">And we went through the <span class="spatial object">train</span> and got these 20 or 21 or 22 people  out of the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, because we had these wonderful papers. </sentence><sentence id="441">What we didn't know is that there was a quota for that <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="442">And while we scrambled to get twenty people out, twenty other people were rounded up without -- regardless of their status, and were just added to the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="443">When I discuss -- I remember discussing this in <span class="populated place">Paris</span> a few years back with Jacqueline, and she said she shared exactly what I felt. </sentence><sentence id="444">She said when she found that out it was a nightmare to realize that the defensive people actually were replacing these people in, you know, in, in the <span class="spatial object">train</span> that we so miraculously saved. </sentence><sentence id="445">Nobody was saved, finally. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="490">Q: How did you choose the people to save? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="492">A: Be--because we had the papers. </sentence><sentence id="493">We, we didn't choose anybody. </sentence><sentence id="494">We managed to, to put together a, a record for these people, enough papers to fit the categories. </sentence><sentence id="495">We didn't choose anybody. </sentence><sentence id="496">I mean, the papers came through. </sentence><sentence id="497">This certificate and that certificate, and this document. </sentence><sentence id="498">And we had sufficient documents for these select twenty people. </sentence><sentence id="499">So we didn't choose them. </sentence><sentence id="500">We -- oh, gosh, no. </sentence><sentence id="501">Nobody played God. </sentence><sentence id="502">But that's what -- that's how we got them out of the <span class="spatial object">train</span>, only we were not realizing that actually twenty-odd people would be added to the quota. </sentence><sentence id="503">Can I stop? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="526">Q: That's the point I want, I would like you to make then -- that you were doing all of this under your own name. </sentence><sentence id="527">Ok, we're back again. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="530">A: Well, during this -- starting in -- as I said, starting in, I think, in August, through September and through the end of the year, deportations continued because round-ups of Jews. </sentence><sentence id="531">First it was the foreign-born Jews. </sentence><sentence id="532">Then it was different -- other categories of Jews. </sentence><sentence id="533">And then it was Jews, period, that were rounded-up. </sentence><sentence id="534">And <span class="populated place">Rivesaltes</span> became the center from which they were sent off to destination unknown. </sentence><sentence id="535">But in the meanwhile, we continued to try to get out as many children as possible through the legal means. </sentence><sentence id="536">And when the legal means didn't work. </sentence><sentence id="537">Because we felt a sense of urgency, sometimes we stood watch at the <span class="dlf">gates</span> when the <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> came loaded with Jews into the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, to try to separate the children from the families right then and there so that we could get them in the special <span class="building">barracks</span> for the children and work on their liberation right away. </sentence><sentence id="538">I mean, in retrospect, to ask the parents who were so bewildered coming into the <span class="populated place">camp</span> and to separate from their children. </sentence><sentence id="539">And we had them in, in, in the special <span class="building">barracks</span>, where the children worried about their parents, where they saved food for their parents, where they matured so quickly. </sentence><sentence id="540">They, they -- sort of there was a, a reversal, as they worrying about their parents just like a parent would worry about a child. </sentence><sentence id="541">And we became also very aware that in the meanwhile -- for a very hypocritical reason of family  reunion -- the French police were -- was going back to the to the <span class="building">homes</span>, the <span class="building">children's homes</span>, to get the children back into the <span class="populated place">camps</span> for family reunion purposes. </sentence><sentence id="542">So we had to try to avoid that as well. </sentence><sentence id="543">Both in the <span class="building">homes</span>, which was impossible when they rounded up the kids, but when they came back into the <span class="populated place">camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="544">And some, of course, were deported with their parents. </sentence><sentence id="545">Some under 16, and definitely the over 16 as well. </sentence><sentence id="546">By the end -- I forget exactly the date -- when the invasion of <span class="region">North Africa</span> came about by the Allies -- all of <span class="country">France</span> was occupied. </sentence><sentence id="547">And I remember the Germans coming down <span class="region">south</span>. </sentence><sentence id="548">In fact, coming there had been no Germans in <span class="populated place">Rivesaltes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="549">This was strictly <span class="populated place">Vichy</span> government. </sentence><sentence id="550">But when the south of <span class="country">France</span> was occupied, the Germans came in as well, and then the round-ups started harder and harder. </sentence><sentence id="551">And I remember one particular one on <span class="building">Simchat Torah</span>. " </sentence><sentence id="552">2 And on Simchat Torah, the very religious Jews, about to be put into the <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> and from the <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> into the into the <span class="spatial object">trains</span>, were dancing to rejoice with the Torah -- which they didn't have. </sentence><sentence id="553">But this was still a holiday that we're celebrating. </sentence><sentence id="554">And truckloads of Jews were coming in from <span class="country">Belgium</span> and from <span class="country">Holland</span>, and from all over. </sentence><sentence id="555">And rounded up all over. </sentence><sentence id="556">And among them, some French-born Jews. </sentence><sentence id="557">It was just absolutely, at this point, a very -- I imagine they were French Jews; I'm not quite sure. </sentence><sentence id="558">But anyway, they were rounded-up, coming into the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="559">In the meanwhile, we continued to get the children out. </sentence><sentence id="560">And one of the one of the girls from my group of teenagers, who was liberated from the <span class="populated place">camp</span> and then placed very briefly with the scouts, was eventually placed into my family to help my parents at the <span class="dlf">farm</span>. </sentence><sentence id="561">She is still living today in <span class="country">Israel</span>, and is my sister-in-law. </sentence><sentence id="562">She married my brother. </sentence><sentence id="563">This is a girl who was born in <span class="country">France</span> of Polish parents, and the parents never bothered to acquire the French nationality. </sentence><sentence id="564">So when the war came, they were all put into <span class="populated place">Rivesaltes</span>: her two parents, her two brothers. </sentence><sentence id="565">The father was deported right away into forced labor, which means he was sent to his death. </sentence><sentence id="566">The older brother joined the Maquis"(r) -- the French underground -- and was killed under such horrible condition that I have never found out the details. </sentence><sentence id="567">The younger brother was placed by <span class="building">OSE</span>, by one of our network workers; and is living still in <span class="country">Israel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="568">And Rachel living with my family. </sentence><sentence id="569">And her mother survived -- also helped by <span class="building">OSE</span>. </sentence><sentence id="570">She just died a year ago in <span class="country">Israel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="571">So by the end of 1942, there remained but about five hundred people in <span class="populated place">Rivesaltes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="572">And all the kids had been -- whatever kids we could liberate, we had sent into various <span class="populated place">camps</span> to the various <span class="building">children's homes</span>, I'm sorry. </sentence><sentence id="573">And, of course, also into the <span class="building">youth facilities</span> of the Jewish scouts, because they had facilities for over-16s. </sentence><sentence id="574">And, of course, we had to lie about the ages; and, of course, we had to get them out. </sentence><sentence id="575">See, by then we still had not directly worked in an <span class="interior space">underground</span> or in illegal kind of way; except that when the pressure came, we tried to help kids escape as much as quickly as we can. </sentence><sentence id="576">I remember always wearing a cape. </sentence><sentence id="577">Girl scouts had capes in those days, khaki capes. </sentence><sentence id="578">And you could get a baby under your arms, you know. </sentence><sentence id="579">And you could walk out of the <span class="populated place">camp</span> with children. </sentence><sentence id="580">The <span class="building">Secours Suisse</span> smuggled  a <span class="spatial object">truck</span> into the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, and we smuggled children out of the <span class="populated place">camp</span> under <span class="spatial object">milk cans</span>. </sentence><sentence id="581">And we there are many different stories to tell as how kids came out, and the one I remember mostly is the one having children on the -- actually, literally, in my arms under my cape. </sentence><sentence id="582">But I don't remember what happened afterwards. </sentence><sentence id="583">We handed them over to another <span class="dlf">network</span>. </sentence><sentence id="584">Each one of us did only one piece of the work. </sentence><sentence id="585">The <span class="populated place">camp</span> was closed in November or December 1942, and whoever was left was sent to <span class="populated place">Gurs</span>. </sentence><sentence id="586">By that time, I had contracted a horrible jaundice because of the living conditions there at the <span class="populated place">camp</span> because we social workers didn't have any more better hygienic conditions than the internees, "though I had an individual <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="587">We had one <span class="building">barrack</span> where all the workers had an individual <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="588">But we had no toilet facilities. </sentence><sentence id="589">And we had one <span class="spatial object">bucket</span> that each one of us took turns having in our own <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="590">We also had bed bugs infesting everything. </sentence><sentence id="591">And though my parents occasionally sent me some food, it was run over with worms by the time I got it. </sentence><sentence id="592">But we scraped it off and we ate it anyway, because it was food. </sentence><sentence id="593">And if I ever want to look again in a, in a -- what are they called?Rutabagas, <span class="populated place">Rutabagas</span>. </sentence><sentence id="594">Never in my life again ever, anyway. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="661">Q: What -- before, before you go on from here, what was it like for Simone Weil? </sentence><sentence id="662">In this <span class="populated place">camp</span>, you're a young woman. </sentence><sentence id="663">What did it feel like to you? </sentence><sentence id="664">Did you miss your parents? </sentence><sentence id="665">Were you feeling that you took any risk in doing this, even though it was legal? </sentence><sentence id="666">What was it like for you doing all these things? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="673">A: At this time it was not illegal yet. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="675">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="677">A: Because I was an accepted French citizen, although Jewish, in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="678">You know, people have asked me, "Did it ?" </sentence><sentence id="679">The same kind of question. </sentence><sentence id="680">First of all, you're young. </sentence><sentence id="681">And when you're young, you feel sort of invulnerable and you really don't think beyond what you have to do. </sentence><sentence id="682">And I think my the other workers were my age. </sentence><sentence id="683">It was it was sort of a natural thing to do. </sentence><sentence id="684">There was a job to be done. </sentence><sentence id="685">It was a natural thing. </sentence><sentence id="686">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="687">It just I don't think I really thought much of the risk. </sentence><sentence id="688">It was very interesting; you ask me about risk. </sentence><sentence id="689">The camp command the commandant of the <span class="populated place">camp</span> was a police commissar of the <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span> in which I had lived in <span class="populated place">Strasbourg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="690">And he knew my father. </sentence><sentence id="691">I'll talk about him again later. </sentence><sentence id="692">There is a connection there. </sentence><sentence id="693">These people took on jobs which, if, if they had refused to take on these jobs, if more people had refused to do these kinds of things, maybe, maybe just maybe, things would not have worked out the way they did. </sentence><sentence id="694">For us, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="695">I guess for me the risk I took -- occasional trips to the <span class="dlf">farm</span>, occasionally. </sentence><sentence id="696">Taking a <span class="spatial object">train</span> to go back to the <span class="dlf">farm</span> was no excursion. </sentence><sentence id="697">On the <span class="spatial object">trains</span> There were so few <span class="spatial object">trains</span>. </sentence><sentence id="698">I usually traveled with a knapsack. </sentence><sentence id="699">And you tried to get your <span class="spatial object">knapsack</span> through a <span class="dlf">window</span>; and you climbed through a <span class="dlf">window</span>, and you stood up all night in the <span class="interior space">hall</span>. </sentence><sentence id="700">Or I remember standing up all night in the <span class="interior space">toilets</span>. </sentence><sentence id="701">You know, we were -- there were so few <span class="spatial object">trains</span>, and so little means of transportation. </sentence><sentence id="702">So I did occasionally go back and see my family. </sentence><sentence id="703">I don't not often, but I, I did. </sentence><sentence id="704">What I did, actually, when the <span class="populated place">camp</span> was closed, I had to go back to my family because I was sick. </sentence><sentence id="705">I was  0 -- and actually, I went to <span class="populated place">Gurs</span>. </sentence><sentence id="706">And but I -- by <span class="populated place">Gurs</span>, by that time, they would not let any new workers come into <span class="populated place">Gurs</span>. </sentence><sentence id="707">And I remember meeting Dr. Joseph Weill in a <span class="spatial object">train</span>, and he says, "You better take care of your -- " I was yellow from here, from the top of my head to the bottom. </sentence><sentence id="708">And I really had to take a rest. </sentence><sentence id="709">So I did go back to the <span class="dlf">farm</span> just to recover from that. </sentence><sentence id="710">From that jaundice or hepatitis, or whatever you'd call it. </sentence><sentence id="711">And when, when I was healthy enough again, then I went to work in one of the <span class="building">children's homes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="712">Because I couldn't get into <span class="populated place">Gurs</span>, and here were all these <span class="building">children's homes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="713">And I had the background in education early childhood education. </sentence><sentence id="714">So I took a job as the chief educator, for <span class="building">OSE</span> again, near <span class="populated place">Limoges</span>. </sentence><sentence id="715">And my family wasn't far. </sentence><sentence id="716">The <span class="dlf">farm</span> wasn't far from <span class="populated place">Limoges</span>, in <span class="populated place">Poulouzat</span>. </sentence><sentence id="717">The Director was Monsieur Job, who later became one of the administrator of <span class="building">OSE</span>, who's still alive in <span class="populated place">Paris</span>, whom I still correspond with, whom I still see when I'm in <span class="populated place">Paris</span>. </sentence><sentence id="718">And here we were, taking care of the children whom we had gotten out of the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="719">This was a <span class="building">home</span> that catered to maybe 50 children of all ages. </sentence><sentence id="720">And we tried to make the children as live as normal a life as possible -- "normal" in quotation marks. </sentence><sentence id="721">Again, the food situation was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="722">I remember sorting out rice in which mice had gotten. </sentence><sentence id="723">And taking out the, the <span class="spatial object">rice doo</span>. </sentence><sentence id="724">Is that what you call it? </sentence><sentence id="725">If it's dog doo, it's rice mice doo. </sentence><sentence id="726">We ate it, because that's all we had. </sentence><sentence id="727">And making do. </sentence><sentence id="728">And, and yet, and, and cutting out things of the papers to decorate the <span class="interior space">rooms</span>. </sentence><sentence id="729">And, and I worked at creating as Jewish an atmosphere as we possibly could, leading Shabbat services. </sentence><sentence id="730">Because of my background, this was no problem. </sentence><sentence id="731">I could do these things very easily. </sentence><sentence id="732">And I tutored some of the kids who had missed schoolings, some who were prepare preparing their baccalaureate. </sentence><sentence id="733">i" They went to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="734">They went to <span class="building">public school</span>, but still under their real names. </sentence><sentence id="735">And this is 1943. </sentence><sentence id="736">I also remember that the drama coach who came on weekends or whatever to teach to, to take care of the kids, was Marcel Marceau, of all people. </sentence><sentence id="737">Whose real name is not Marcel Marceau, but whose real name is Marcel Mangel (ph), and who was a kid from my <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span> in <span class="populated place">Strasbourg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="738">And so we had the best. </sentence><sentence id="739">He was a student at that time, doing artwork in <span class="populated place">Limoges</span>. </sentence><sentence id="740">But these were these were my peers. </sentence><sentence id="741">You know, he's a little bit younger than I am. </sentence><sentence id="742">But by that time the <span class="building">OSE Direction</span> had seen the writing on the <span class="dlf">wall</span>. </sentence><sentence id="743">Some children's <span class="building">homes</span> had been rounded up. </sentence><sentence id="744">The police was coming to pick up the <span class="spatial object">over-16</span>. </sentence><sentence id="745">The police -- the French police I'm talking about -- was finding these very easy targets, because here was a group of Jewish children. </sentence><sentence id="746">So at that time, the OSE Direction had decided that the children had to get out of the <span class="building">homes</span> in two steps. </sentence><sentence id="747">There was one step: they was under their real names, into non- Jewish kind of settings, but mostly, to form a clandestine network and place the children under assumed names. </sentence><sentence id="748">And workers were recruited for that, and I was one of them. </sentence><sentence id="749">what  1 were the qualifications? </sentence><sentence id="750">None, really. </sentence><sentence id="751">Wanting to do it, but also not being not looking "Jewish." </sentence><sentence id="752">Quote, unquote. </sentence><sentence id="753">I mean, there are some people who just simply couldn't do it because they were "types,""deg as we called it. </sentence><sentence id="754">And so I qualified. </sentence><sentence id="755">And Georges Garel, who is organized this clandestine network for OSE, recruited me in <span class="populated place">Poulouzat</span> in <span class="building">children's home</span> where I worked because all the <span class="building">children's homes</span> were going to be closed. </sentence><sentence id="756">In the meanwhile, there had been arretes -- arrests -- in the Direction of <span class="building">OSE</span> and the various <span class="building">offices</span>. </sentence><sentence id="757">There had been really -- it was danger with knowing where the children were, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="758">So I got recruited for this. </sentence><sentence id="759">And this was towards the end of "43. </sentence><sentence id="760">I therefore left the children's <span class="building">home</span>, and took up residence in <span class="populated place">Chateauroux</span>. </sentence><sentence id="761"><span class="populated place">Chateauroux</span> is about what -- 60, 75 miles north of <span class="populated place">Limoges</span>. </sentence><sentence id="762">Well, I had to change identity. </sentence><sentence id="763">And my name was Simone Weil, and I decided on "Werlin (ph)," because it was sort of easy to change the "I" to an "R" and to add something at the end of it. </sentence><sentence id="764">And I had to work on getting, number one, a nationality -- a Fiche de Nationalite."* </sentence><sentence id="765">I'm not quite sure how I got it, but I have it. </sentence><sentence id="766">And from that on -- oh, and I made myself being born in <span class="populated place">Toul</span>, because we -- I knew that in <span class="populated place">Toul</span>, the, the <span class="building">city hall</span> had been bombed and all the documents had disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="767">And by then, there was really a whole network of people working in forging false papers. </sentence><sentence id="768">So we had access to identification cards, blank ones and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="769">But I did it, really, the legal way. </sentence><sentence id="770">After I had a Fiche de Nationalite by which I think I got by just making a statement -- then I had that, claiming that papers had disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="771">I couldn't produce a birth certificate. </sentence><sentence id="772">I got an identification card and gave a <span class="populated place">Limoges</span> address, and immediately then moved to <span class="populated place">Chateauroux</span>. </sentence><sentence id="773">And had myself registered in <span class="populated place">Chateauroux</span>. </sentence><sentence id="774">So it was perfectly legal. </sentence><sentence id="775">I mean, it was perfectly ok. </sentence><sentence id="776">The most wonderful thing -- my nose. </sentence><sentence id="777">The most wonderful thing that helped me in the forging my identity was the help I got from the Director of the <span class="building">school of social work</span> and the director of the <span class="building">school of early childhood education</span>. </sentence><sentence id="778">One lived in <span class="populated place">Clermont-Ferrand</span>. </sentence><sentence id="779">One lived in <span class="populated place">Paris</span>. </sentence><sentence id="780">I took the trip, and I just simply told them that I needed their help. </sentence><sentence id="781">And I have in my documents still a certificate stating that I that Simone Werlin was their student in 1938. </sentence><sentence id="782">I got a certifi-- I got a diploma established in on that name, under my false name. </sentence><sentence id="783">And I got some others you know, other statements to that effect. </sentence><sentence id="784">And to this day, I am convinced that at the time I was arrested, to which I'm going to come later, that these papers helped me. </sentence><sentence id="785">And these people, without, without any question, just established these papers for me. </sentence><sentence id="786">In fact, I went to <span class="populated place">Paris</span>. </sentence><sentence id="787">I remember very well, because this is the first time I saw people wearing the yellow star because we did not wear it in the south of <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="788">I also needed a cover. </sentence><sentence id="789">And the <span class="building">Department of Public Health</span> put me on their fictitious payroll, I suppose. </sentence><sentence id="790">But I had a statement saying that Simone Werlin is employed by the <span class="building">Department of Public Health</span>. </sentence><sentence id="791">And just to make sure that I knew what I was, what the <span class="building">Department of Public Health</span> was, I went at least there once. </sentence><sentence id="792">And now comes a funny story. </sentence><sentence id="793">You know what <span class="building">department</span> was assigned to? </sentence><sentence id="794">The <span class="building">department</span> that checked the health of the prostitutes of the <span class="populated place">city</span> of <span class="populated place">Chateauroux</span>. </sentence><sentence id="795">And they were coming regularly to that <span class="building">clinic</span> to be examined, and that was my  2 assignment. </sentence><sentence id="796">But at least I knew what my assignment was so that later on I had to describe it, I could describe it. </sentence><sentence id="797">But it has a little funny aspect to it. </sentence><sentence id="798">I got a <span class="interior space">room</span>, stayed with two elderly ladies. </sentence><sentence id="799">And we had a team working together in <span class="populated place">Chateauroux</span>. </sentence><sentence id="800">I remember at least two of them. </sentence><sentence id="801">One was a cousin of mine. </sentence><sentence id="802">And we all had assumed names. </sentence><sentence id="803">And children would come to us, brought from various <span class="building">children's home</span> by a worker. </sentence><sentence id="804">Brought to us, for us to change the identity of the kids, and then place them in various <span class="building">foster homes</span>, <span class="building">institutions</span>, families, <span class="building">convents</span>, what have you. </sentence><sentence id="805">This was our job. </sentence><sentence id="806">And transportation was mostly <span class="spatial object">bicycles</span>, <span class="spatial object">train</span>, horse and <span class="spatial object">buggy</span>, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="807">Or walking. </sentence><sentence id="808">Whatever we could round up. </sentence><sentence id="809">And it ended up by, by having around <span class="populated place">Chateauroux</span>, in that whole <span class="region">area</span>, we had some three hundred and fifty kids placed. </sentence><sentence id="810">The Direction of the <span class="region">region</span> was in <span class="populated place">Limoges</span>, but <span class="populated place">Chateauroux</span>, in that <span class="region">region</span>, we had between three and 350 kids. </sentence><sentence id="811">It was a matter of finding the places and trying to finding following up with the kids. </sentence><sentence id="812">What I remember most dramatically -- and, and also sometimes through <span class="populated place">Chateauroux</span> came groups of children that had to be escorted towards other workers, who would help them get into <span class="country">Switzerland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="813">And I remember one group of children that came one night, and we had to find a place for them overnight. </sentence><sentence id="814">And I in some <span class="building">school</span> or some <span class="building">institution</span>. </sentence><sentence id="815">And we worked feverishly all night to get them false papers. </sentence><sentence id="816">For the kids. </sentence><sentence id="817">And take out the labels out of their clothes that the mothers had lovingly sewed into their clothes and take those labels out. </sentence><sentence id="818">And look through their <span class="spatial object">luggage</span>. </sentence><sentence id="819">Take away whatever they had because they had to have be safe. </sentence><sentence id="820">And just coach them in what their new identity was. </sentence><sentence id="821">I have often said that if I had known then what I have since learned, being a clinical social worker, I think I would have been completely immobilized by the, the traumatization that these children went through. </sentence><sentence id="822">I could have just not functioned. </sentence><sentence id="823">And it was just a matter of saving lives, and that was it. </sentence><sentence id="824">And I remember taking these -- I don't know how many children -- and spreading them through a <span class="spatial object">train</span>, and coaching them. </sentence><sentence id="825">Some who spoke French was all right. </sentence><sentence id="826">Some who spoke with an accent, they were supposed to be from <span class="region">Alsace</span>. </sentence><sentence id="827">And telling them what their name was, and knowing how to answer. </sentence><sentence id="828">And getting spreading them through the <span class="spatial object">train</span>, and getting them across <span class="country">France</span> into <span class="populated place">Lyons</span>. </sentence><sentence id="829">And there, getting them to another team of workers. </sentence><sentence id="830">That was the end of my mission. </sentence><sentence id="831">And they would then be handed over to somebody else, and gotten into <span class="country">Switzerland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="832">And kids came day and night, and we changed their identity. </sentence><sentence id="833">I remember most I remember two incidents that I want to relate. </sentence><sentence id="834">One of the source of help was the <span class="building">Catholic Church</span>. </sentence><sentence id="835">And the <span class="region">area</span> the <span class="region">area</span> close to the <span class="building">Chateau</span> was <span class="populated place">Bourges</span>, which has an arch archbishop-- archbishopric. </sentence><sentence id="836">Is that the word? </sentence><sentence id="837">And I went to see the Archbishop of Bourges, to ask him for making -- it easy mak-- making the entry into <span class="building">convents</span> and to all <span class="building">Catholic orphanages</span> easy for us. </sentence><sentence id="838">But he knew what was the object of my mission, but it was never discussed. </sentence><sentence id="839">I had never encountered an archbishop in my life. </sentence><sentence id="840">And I went to the Archbishop in <span class="populated place">Bourges</span>, and he gave me a letter of introduction to the various <span class="building">Catholic institutions</span>. </sentence><sentence id="841"> 3 He also handed my hand with his ring, and I hadn't the slightest idea what I was supposed to do with it. </sentence><sentence id="842">But that was a minor detail. </sentence><sentence id="843">I also worked with <span class="building">Protestant agency</span> that ran <span class="building">summer camps</span> for kids who had to flee <span class="populated place">Paris</span>. </sentence><sentence id="844">And she also -- this was a partisan social worker in <span class="populated place">Bourges</span>, who was very unhappy being in this very Catholic kind of <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="845">And she had no idea what the real object of my work was. </sentence><sentence id="846">All I wanted is place children in her <span class="populated place">summer camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="847">And I hit it off with her. </sentence><sentence id="848">And because she was so unhappy as a Protestant in this Catholic environment, taking me for a Catholic we had some discussion which made her say that she had never met such a liberal Catholic as I. I haven't the slightest idea what I said. </sentence><sentence id="849">But when the dis-- when the questions became too difficult, I managed to escape by pretending that I wasn't feeling well and going to the <span class="interior space">bath</span>. </sentence><sentence id="850">But anyway, we had the openings to these <span class="populated place">camps</span>, <span class="populated place">summer camps</span>, for our children, and that's where we placed them. </sentence><sentence id="851">I worked at that time with another worker, who was actually not Jewish, Ann-Marie, and with two other workers who were not Jewish, among in our team, as well. </sentence><sentence id="852">At one time and at one time and, of course, the as the war was drawing closer and closer to an end, the round-ups just continued. </sentence><sentence id="853">Both my parents were arrested at the <span class="dlf">farm</span>. </sentence><sentence id="854">And "though I had -- by that time, the uncles and aunts had left; and there was just my both my parents, my grandmother, my brother and, and the girl we had placed, you know, who placed from, from <span class="populated place">Rivesaltes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="855">The uncles and aunts had gone elsewhere, found their own place. </sentence><sentence id="856">And I had provided my parents with false papers. </sentence><sentence id="857">But, when in the spring of 1944, the gendarmes came up and said to my father, "Etes-vous Juif, Monsieur?""" </sentence><sentence id="858">He said, "Oui, Monsieur.""* </sentence><sentence id="859">And they took both my mother and my father, leaving -- and my brother pretended that he was the farm hand, and my sist-- my future sister-in-law, too. </sentence><sentence id="860">She was the maid, she pretended. </sentence><sentence id="861">And both my parents were interned in a <span class="populated place">camp</span> near the <span class="dlf">farm</span>. </sentence><sentence id="862">But the French police actually went over and beyond the expectations of the German authority, and had taken my mother to a <span class="populated place">camp</span> that was only for men. </sentence><sentence id="863">So after 24 hours, they sent her back to the <span class="dlf">farm</span>. </sentence><sentence id="864">And she survived. </sentence><sentence id="865">And I had heard had word of my father being in that <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="866">So I -- oh, I always traveled in something that looked like a <span class="building">Red Cross</span> uniform. </sentence><sentence id="867">Something navy-bluish, and some <span class="building">Red Cross</span> sign. </sentence><sentence id="868">I mean, it was really nothing real, but it looked like a uniform, so I had access to the <span class="populated place">camp</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="869">And through some cigarettes or tobacco or something, I got a message to my father. </sentence><sentence id="870">Who, by the way, survived. </sentence><sentence id="871">Because on D-Day 1944, the <span class="populated place">camp</span> was attacked by the Maquis and the internees were able to escape -- among which my father who returned to the <span class="dlf">farm</span>. </sentence><sentence id="872">But in the meanwhile, there was great concern for my grandmother. </sentence><sentence id="873">And I managed to come back, round-up a <span class="spatial object">truck</span> from the Maquis -- from the <span class="interior space">underground</span> -- and load my grandmother into the <span class="spatial object">truck</span> and get her to <span class="populated place">Perigueux</span>, the <span class="populated place">city</span> near the, the <span class="region">city prefecture</span> where we lived, and get her into an <span class="building">old age home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="874">And a very nice gentile woman would visit her regularly there. </sentence><sentence id="875">But aside from the other work that I did, it was one of the most dramatic things that I did because she was nearly blind. </sentence><sentence id="876">And she said, "Don't leave me here!" </sentence><sentence id="877">And the <span class="spatial object">bed</span> was on the wrong side and she  4 couldn't find her things, but I had no choice. </sentence><sentence id="878">I left her, but she survived. </sentence><sentence id="879">Not very long. </sentence><sentence id="880">She never came back to <span class="populated place">Alsace</span>, but she did survive the, the this period of the <span class="building">old age home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="881">Also when I was in <span class="populated place">Chateauroux</span>, you know, Georges Garel, the head of our network, would appear from time to time. </sentence><sentence id="882">And he appeared one morning, having come from God knows where. </sentence><sentence id="883">And coming to that <span class="interior space">room</span> which I rented and say, "You know, we have to move very fast. </sentence><sentence id="884">The members of the <span class="building">Jewish Committee</span> in <span class="populated place">Perigueux</span> have all been shot as in reprisal for God knows what had happened to some German.

must have functioned. </sentence><sentence id="894">And I called them in the <span class="building">school</span> in which they were. </sentence><sentence id="895">And I told them, "You pack up, and you go. </sentence><sentence id="896">And you come to <span class="populated place">Chateauroux</span>, and I'll be at the <span class="building">station</span>." </sentence><sentence id="897">And I was there. </sentence><sentence id="898">And they came. </sentence><sentence id="899">And there was a curfew. </sentence><sentence id="900">I don't know how I made it through the curfew. </sentence><sentence id="901">And we got them into a safe <span class="building">home</span> we had at <span class="populated place">Chateauroux</span>.; </sentence><sentence id="902">there was gentile lady who loaned us the <span class="interior space">apartment</span> where we could do our papers. </sentence><sentence id="903">So I remember changing their name to <span class="populated

id="1357">Now, just a few  7 years ago in <span class="populated place">Paris</span>, I met a woman who, when we're introduced to each other, says, "Oh, I know who you are. </sentence><sentence id="1358">You spent the night. </sentence><sentence id="1359">You were arrested in my <span class="interior space">room</span>." </sentence><sentence id="1360">I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="1361">I have absolutely no memory of it. </sentence><sentence id="1362">She remembered the incident. </sentence><sentence id="1363">She remembers <span class="populated place">Charlotte</span>, and how she and Paulette and another young woman rescued <span class="populated place">Charlotte</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1364">I don't know how. </sentence><sentence id="1365">I don't know how. </sentence><sentence id="1366">But for me, I was anxious to get out of <span class="populated place">Limoges</span> with my cleansed knapsack. </sentence><sentence id="1367">I remember this as a straight <span class="dlf">route</span> to <span class="populated place">Limoges</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1368">And I took it a few years back, and it was the rollercoast-- the worst <span class="dlf">rollercoaster road</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1369">And my husband said to me, "This is a straight <span class="dlf">road</span>?" </sentence><sentence id="1370">In my memory, this was a straight <span class="dlf">road</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1371">So I came back to <span class="populated place">Chateauroux</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1372">And no sooner did I get to my <span class="interior space">room</span> that my landlady says, "Your friends from <span class="populated place">Limoges</span> came to see you, and you were not <span class="building">home</span>." </sentence><sentence id="1373">Needless to say that I spent no time in <span class="populated place">Chateauroux</span>, and took my <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> and went on to <span class="populated place">Bourges</span>, where I had somebody else. </sentence><sentence id="1374">But you see, it wasn't always <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1375">Whenever we could, we took a <span class="spatial object">train</span> and put the <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> in the <span class="interior space">luggage compartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1376">And we went as far as we could on the <span class="spatial object">train</span>, on where the Maquis had blown up the <span class="dlf">tracks</span>, we had to get out. </sentence><sentence id="1377">We were always rejoicing when the <span class="dlf">tracks</span> were blown up. </sentence><sentence id="1378">So we took the <span class="spatial object">bike</span>, and we went a little bit further. </sentence><sentence id="1379">So that way, we, we traveled. </sentence><sentence id="1380">So I went to <span class="populated place">Bourges</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1381">And I even remember getting a horse and <span class="spatial object">buggy</span> part of the way, putting the <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> in the back, and getting there until things calmed down until my friends from <span class="populated place">Limoges</span> were, were sure that I was somewhat safe. </sentence><sentence id="1382">There's another crazy incident that I do remember, is that I had mentioned earlier that the head of the camp of <span class="populated place">Rivesaltes</span> was the Commissar de Police from <span class="populated place">Strasbourg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1383">He ended up being the Commissar de Police of <span class="populated place">Chateauroux</span>, where I was doing underground work. </sentence><sentence id="1384">And I did something which today seems absolutely crazy to me. </sentence><sentence id="1385">I went to him. </sentence><sentence id="1386">And I told him, "I know you know who I am." </sentence><sentence id="1387">But I told him that I was working under a false name, and what I was doing. </sentence><sentence id="1388">And I was expecting him to leave me alone. </sentence><sentence id="1389">In retrospect, it sounds absolutely totally crazy. </sentence><sentence id="1390">But he never bothered me. </sentence><sentence id="1391">It so happened that after the war as soon as the war was over, and when you know, when they sought out the collaborators, he came to me begging for some kind of, you know, "See what I did for you?!" </sentence><sentence id="1392">But at that time I went to my superiors at <span class="building">OSE</span>, who says, "He doesn't deserve any, any kind of consideration because if he hadn't been the, the commandant of the camp of <span class="populated place">Rivesaltes</span> and he hadn't accepted that job, it would have been, you know, more to his credit." </sentence><sentence id="1393">So, but this is the -- so but this is the -- so you asked me earlier, "How did it feel?" </sentence><sentence id="1394">I got a sense of invulnerability. </sentence><sentence id="1395">Of -- I had to do a job; and you do it with some kind of daring. </sentence><sentence id="1396">And you, you feel I could wear these uniforms of <span class="building">Red Cross</span>, or doing and, and just pretend and do anything. </sentence><sentence id="1397">And I didn't feel it was anything terribly unusual, because I saw all my peers doing it. </sentence><sentence id="1398">All my peers from the youth movement did the same kind of work, whether it was in the in the escape, the <span class="dlf">routes</span> to <span class="country">Spain</span> or to, to <span class="country">Switzerland</span> -- or whether it was in the in the Maquis. </sentence><sentence id="1399">Whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1400">We did it because that was the thing to do. </sentence><sentence id="1401">That brings us pretty much to almost the end of the war -- no. [ </sentence><sentence id="1402">remember D-Day -- June 6th, 1944. </sentence><sentence id="1403">I thought it was all over. </sentence><sentence id="1404">It wasn't over by far. </sentence><sentence id="1405">And I put my the gold little flag on my <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span>, but very quickly put it back in. </sentence><sentence id="1406">You see, I had lived as really with these two ladies, who took me for a very good Catholic girl. </sentence><sentence id="1407">In fact, I had a rosary, and I had went to <span class="building">church</span> every Sunday morning in  8 the back of the <span class="building">church</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1408">But anyway, it was too early to really tell them. </sentence><sentence id="1409">I was I was just exploding with telling the truth, but we couldn't because as the in, you know, as the Allies had landed, that didn't mean at all that <span class="country">France</span> was liberated. </sentence><sentence id="1410">And then the fierce battling went on -- the bombings. </sentence><sentence id="1411">I was part of the <span class="building">Red Cross</span> emergency teams, where we went when there were bombings, picking people out from under the rubble. </sentence><sentence id="1412">This was just a civil service of a some job that I didn't do as part of my underground work or anything. </sentence><sentence id="1413">It was just a community work. </sentence><sentence id="1414">And that went on. </sentence><sentence id="1415">And as reprisals, very nearby was this horrible incident of <span class="populated place">Oradour-sur-Glane</span>, where the Germans locked up the whole population in a <span class="building">church</span> and put fire to the <span class="building">church</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1416">This was non-Jews as well as Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1417">I mean, it had nothing to do -- they had just to do with the psychology of an army that was losing the war and went and arresting more Jews and more kids that came our way. </sentence><sentence id="1418">But don't ask me the details of how it happened. </sentence><sentence id="1419">I know it happened. </sentence><sentence id="1420">I know we did it. </sentence><sentence id="1421">I know I did it, but I don't remember the details. </sentence><sentence id="1422">I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="1423">More kids coming, and I know we placed more kids. </sentence><sentence id="1424">It was just a frenzy of, of, of needs at that time, until finally the war was over. </sentence><sentence id="1425">I, I know this was a, a very hectic period. </sentence><sentence id="1426">I remember -- one more thing is this team of, of Jewish girls celebrating Passover that spring, in the <span class="interior space">basement</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1427">And one of us watching, standing guard at the <span class="dlf">door</span>, just like Marrano-type kind of celebration. </sentence><sentence id="1428">These, some of these little details come up once in a while. </sentence><sentence id="1429">But I have mulled over and over and with great guilt, really, as to why I don't remember individual children and individual stories. </sentence><sentence id="1430">With very few exceptions, I don't. </sentence><sentence id="1431">My sister-in-law, those of my cousins. </sentence><sentence id="1432">And the only explanation I can come up with is that the fear of getting attached or the inability to get attached to individuals, for fear of loss, for fear of getting too close. </sentence><sentence id="1433">And so that I do not remember individual stories, with the few exceptions that I gave you. </sentence><sentence id="1434">Also is I left the United -- I left <span class="country">France</span> in 1946, after filling a couple of years very briefly. </sentence><sentence id="1435">And I had one urge and that is to put everything I cut even loose from the people I worked with during the war. </sentence><sentence id="1436">I never spoke French to my children, never talked about any of that story. </sentence><sentence id="1437">It was all something to put behind me. </sentence><sentence id="1438">And it's not until about 10, 12 years ago or so that I became part of, of those of us who feel a responsibility of, of telling our individual stories. </sentence><sentence id="1439">When the war was over in our in my <span class="region">area</span>, <span class="populated place">Limoges</span> and <span class="populated place">Chateauroux</span>, in the fall of 19-- oh, just before the High Holy Days in 1944, when I remember getting my cousins out of that <span class="building">convent</span>, and I remember getting anyway, I just went there and got them and put them on God knows what <span class="spatial object">trucks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1440">And from one <span class="dlf">stage</span> to the other, and got them back to the <span class="dlf">farm</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1441">Because that my, my parents and uncles and aunts were the only living relatives they had, having lost both parents, and leaving them with my family but with very little time to, to spend there. </sentence><sentence id="1442">Because OSE immediately asked me to reopen one of their <span class="building">homes</span>, and I reopened the first <span class="building">home</span> in <span class="populated place">Montintin</span>, in the center of <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1443">It was a big old <span class="building">chateau</span> which had been a <span class="building">children's home</span> before, but it was closed during all this clandestine period. </sentence><sentence id="1444">And it was populated by rats and by filth. </sentence><sentence id="1445">And we cleaned the rats. </sentence><sentence id="1446">To today, I stand on a <span class="spatial object">chair</span> if I  9 see a mouse. </sentence><sentence id="1447">In those days, we put <span class="spatial object">traps</span> in, and we caught one rat after another, and we cleansed it. </sentence><sentence id="1448">And it was the most exhilarating kind of experience. </sentence><sentence id="1449">And we got as quickly as we could the children out of the <span class="building">religious institutions</span>, of the <span class="building">Catholic institutions</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1450">And we had no idea yet as to what had happened to their parents, of course, because it wouldn't be until the spring of the following year when the Allies would reach the <span class="populated place">death camps</span> that we really had the reality of what had happened. </sentence><sentence id="1451">So we did the best we could to create as quickly as we could a real happy Jewish atmosphere for those children. </sentence><sentence id="1452">With nothing. </sentence><sentence id="1453">With whatever we could. </sentence><sentence id="1454">We had staff survive -- survivors. </sentence><sentence id="1455">I remember particularly one couple from <span class="country">Holland</span> who had survived. </sentence><sentence id="1456">And I had really a desire to do something in my <span class="dlf">field</span>, and that is, create a <span class="building">home</span> for pre-school children. </sentence><sentence id="1457">Because <span class="building">pre-school</span> is, was and has always been -- and continues to be -- my <span class="region">area</span> of interest. </sentence><sentence id="1458">And <span class="building">OSE</span> then replaced, replaced me at <span class="populated place">Montintin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1459">And I went to <span class="populated place">Paris</span>; and with another girl, actually, who had worked in <span class="populated place">Rivesaltes</span> -- but not for OSE, but for the Unitarians. </sentence><sentence id="1460">Jacqueline and I -- who had the same training under the auspices of OSE -- we set up a wonderful <span class="building">model home</span> for pre-school age children. </sentence><sentence id="1461">Later on, when I read Anna Freud on war and children and infants without family, I realized we really copied -- we copies...no, we didn't copy it. </sentence><sentence id="1462">We initiated the same <span class="spatial object">model</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1463">And these children had survived in hiding -- but not only children who had survived in hiding. </sentence><sentence id="1464">Children who were entrusted to us by parents who couldn't handle them. </sentence><sentence id="1465">They had survived themselves, but they were alone. </sentence><sentence id="1466">And for a period of time, we had these children. </sentence><sentence id="1467">But it was also a <span class="building">training school</span> for early childhood educators. </sentence><sentence id="1468">Actually, my diploma was in Montessori education. </sentence><sentence id="1469">So we set up a Montessori program in, in the -- in a <span class="building">chateau</span> near <span class="populated place">Paris</span>, which, by coincidence, happens to be the one where I had taught in a <span class="building">private school</span> before the war. </sentence><sentence id="1470">It was a beautiful place, surrounded by <span class="env feature">ground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1471">And there I stayed until -- this was "45 -- and all the do-gooders from the <span class="country">United States</span> came over. </sentence><sentence id="1472">Oh, the most wonderful thing I got is a pair of army shoes. </sentence><sentence id="1473">A <span class="spatial object">WAAC</span>" gave me some shoes. </sentence><sentence id="1474">That was wonderful! </sentence><sentence id="1475">And they brought us candy, and they brought us all kinds of stuff. </sentence><sentence id="1476">But the important thing is that I was asked whether I would want to come to the <span class="country">States</span> to continue my training, to go back to <span class="country">France</span> and continue on with my work. </sentence><sentence id="1477">To tell you the truth, I would have gone blind-folded to the <span class="env feature">moon</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1478">I would have gone anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="1479">This was it. </sentence><sentence id="1480">Was I was ready for a change. </sentence><sentence id="1481">And why me? </sentence><sentence id="1482">Why not Jacqueline? </sentence><sentence id="1483">Jacqueline didn't know English. </sentence><sentence id="1484">She was just as qualified, but I knew English. </sentence><sentence id="1485">This was a scholarship offered by the National Council of Jewish Women, who had set up a program of scholarships to give additional training for people who had worked under these circumstances; in, in Europe, not just in <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1486">And would return to their <span class="country">countries</span> to continue to improve the situation. </sentence><sentence id="1487">So I had a very hard time. </sentence><sentence id="1488">It's Georges Garel, who actually was wrote paper upon letters upon letters to get me a place on a <span class="spatial object">boat</span>, and I came on a <span class="spatial object">warship</span> in 1946. </sentence><sentence id="1489">And the Council of Jewish Women sent me to <span class="building">Tulane University</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1490">And for one year, but extended my scholarship for a second year, which I completed in <span class="populated place">Cleveland</span>, and got my Master's Degree in social work. </sentence><sentence id="1491">But in the meanwhile, I had met my future husband. </sentence><sentence id="1492">But I did return to  0 <span class="country">France</span> before we got married, and worked for the <span class="building">Joint Distribution Committee</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1493">And there I am worked in -- really, at that time, the local agencies who had all these <span class="building">children's homes</span> and all these children had to reassess the needs of these children. </sentence><sentence id="1494">And I did survey upon survey of facilities -- not just OSE of various <span class="building">children's homes</span> -- to assess their need and to see what else could be done with the children. </sentence><sentence id="1495">And I also set up L'Association des Travailleurs Juives"". </sentence><sentence id="1496">I started with training workers in the various <span class="building">homes</span>, with my newly acquired wisdom in social work. </sentence><sentence id="1497">And I started this program going, going through the JDC.And my commitment was for at least two years, but I was itching to get back and to the <span class="country">States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1498">And after a year, I came back to the <span class="country">States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1499">And that's the end of the story, I guess. </sentence><sentence id="1500">I continued in social work for the rest of my life. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1654">Q: What -- tell us a little bit, if you would, about your adjustment to the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1655">What had that year been like when you were here, and what was it like when you returned? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1658">A: Well, when I originally came -- there's two stages there. </sentence><sentence id="1659">It's interesting. </sentence><sentence id="1660">When I went to <span class="building">Tulane University</span> I found this to be a dilemma, which was far below what I was used to in my own work and in my own experience. </sentence><sentence id="1661">And I didn't feel -- besides, I really had no intention of getting a degree. </sentence><sentence id="1662">It was just a year to be exposed to things here. </sentence><sentence id="1663">So I didn't work very hard. </sentence><sentence id="1664">I was asked to talk about my war experience, and I found it very strange. </sentence><sentence id="1665">Why talk about my war experience? </sentence><sentence id="1666">Everybody else had done it. </sentence><sentence id="1667">And why did I have to talk about it?And yet I did because I was their first student. </sentence><sentence id="1668">And I went to their triennial conventions, and I talked about it. </sentence><sentence id="1669">I don't know what I said and how I told the story then. </sentence><sentence id="1670">There was a lot of publicity. </sentence><sentence id="1671">And it bothered me for two reasons. </sentence><sentence id="1672">One, because as I said, it seemed so natural to have done that. </sentence><sentence id="1673">I didn't see what was the big fuss, the heroism about it. </sentence><sentence id="1674">Everybody did it, in my mind. </sentence><sentence id="1675">And the other thing is, is the thought of all the children we didn't save. </sentence><sentence id="1676">And how can you sort of make it this beautiful story? </sentence><sentence id="1677">There was just one other thing is that there were there was a program of <span class="building">Ship-a-Box</span> the Council of Jewish Women had. </sentence><sentence id="1678">And I accepted to talk, provided they sent packages overseas. </sentence><sentence id="1679">And that was one of the, you know, redeeming features of my talking. </sentence><sentence id="1680">When I transferred to <span class="populated place">Case Western</span> -- no. </sentence><sentence id="1681">It wasn't <span class="populated place">Case Western</span>, it was <span class="building">Western Reserve University</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1682">I got a somewhat different experience. </sentence><sentence id="1683">And yet, I remember my supervisor, or my faculty advisor, never asking me what my experience had been or what, what my expertise. </sentence><sentence id="1684">I mean, after all, I had left 1 was By then, I was 26 years old. </sentence><sentence id="1685">I was not a kid fresh out of <span class="building">high school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1686">I mean, this was <span class="building">graduate school</span> because I got credit for all my work I had done. </sentence><sentence id="1687">And I didn't find the academic work any difficult at all. </sentence><sentence id="1688">I didn't find -- what surprised me very much is the true and false kind of multiple choice kinds of things, because I'm not used -- I wasn't used to that kind of thing. </sentence><sentence id="1689">And there was a naivete about people. </sentence><sentence id="1690">I had a sense that they didn't know what life was what real life was about. </sentence><sentence id="1691">It was all textbook kind of stuff. </sentence><sentence id="1692">Until I finally got one supervisor who asked me about -- not about my work during the war, but about my concepts about working with people and children. </sentence><sentence id="1693">And I said, "Finally, somebody feels that we know something there, too." </sentence><sentence id="1694">You  1 know, it's not just in the <span class="country">United States</span> that they have invented social work, or that we -- to me, it was much too theoretical and so unhum-- it was right and wrong, and there was no nuances. </sentence><sentence id="1695">There were I fought tremendously with my faculty advisor about one particular <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1696">Social workers were being trained to work in <span class="building">children's homes</span> in the <span class="country">United States</span>, and I did my field work at <span class="building">Bellfaire</span> in <span class="populated place">Cleveland</span>, which was one of the top-notch <span class="building">child-care agencies</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1697">They were training the social workers who saw the child one hour a week. </sentence><sentence id="1698">To me, it made much more sense to do it the way we did it in <span class="country">France</span>, and that is, train the house parents who worked with the children on 24 hours a day basis. </sentence><sentence id="1699">And I couldn't understand. </sentence><sentence id="1700">We would train people in <span class="country">France</span> who lived with the children, who were with them all the time. </sentence><sentence id="1701">But we're training a therpa-- a social worker therapist, who saw the child one hour a week. </sentence><sentence id="1702">And that didn't make sense to me. </sentence><sentence id="1703">Does that answer your question? </sentence><sentence id="1704">And but more, I think one of the reasons I was just thinking of something. </sentence><sentence id="1705">One of the reasons I clamed up, too, is that there was such a lack of comprehension as to what really happened. </sentence><sentence id="1706">The questions sometimes were so -- excuse me, but -- stupid. </sentence><sentence id="1707">And it's hard to talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="1708">It still happens today. </sentence><sentence id="1709">I'll give you an example. </sentence><sentence id="1710">Very recently, in <span class="populated place">Chapel Hill</span>, I was asked to talk to a <span class="building">junior high school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1711">A very sweet young teacher had her class read The Diary of Anne Frank. </sentence><sentence id="1712">And could I -- she got my names through the Jewish Federation, because I'm very active in the <span class="populated place">community</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="1713">And could I come and talk about my own experience? </sentence><sentence id="1714">And I did, at what I hoped it would be <span class="building">junior high school</span> level -- which is not particularly my forte, but I tried to tailor it to, to them. </sentence><sentence id="1715">And especially ask questions. </sentence><sentence id="1716">And the kids were wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="1717">They really had some very pertinent questions. </sentence><sentence id="1718">The teacher, when I recalled the incident of being arrested and, and Charlotte being put into <span class="building">prison</span>, said, "But on what basis did they arrest her?" </sentence><sentence id="1719">And you know I mean, there's this you feel like screaming! </sentence><sentence id="1720">And, and in front of the kids, I didn't want to tell the teacher what kind of question is that. </sentence><sentence id="1721">I said, "This is war. </sentence><sentence id="1722">This is you know, you don't have to have any reason." </sentence><sentence id="1723">And so on. </sentence><sentence id="1724">So in retrospect, I think, also this was one of the reasons maybe I didn't talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="1725">The other thing is, in <span class="populated place">Cleveland</span> we really had -- there were some people there was a whole a group of German Jews who had left <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1726">That's how I met my husband. </sentence><sentence id="1727">He's, he's from <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1728">He has a whole other saga to tell, but which he wouldn't tell, because he cannot talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="1729">But there was a group of what I called people with European background, and as one didn't need to talk about this. </sentence><sentence id="1730">This was really my <span class="dlf">circle</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1731">One of my very close friends was from <span class="country">Italy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1732">My husband's friends were from <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1733">And you didn't have to dwell on these things. </sentence><sentence id="1734">It was part of what you brought with you to your daily living. </sentence><sentence id="1735">And, and I realized, when I started talking about it in <span class="populated place">Syracuse</span> -- it all started when the Council of Jewish Women in <span class="populated place">Syracuse</span> had a workshop for teachers in the <span class="building">public school</span> to teach the Holocaust, to introduce the teaching, whatever that means, teaching the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="1736">And I participated in this workshop. </sentence><sentence id="1737">And I became aware, and I began to accept, to recount some of that. </sentence><sentence id="1738">Again there was, you know, when I say "Rivesaltes" to most my, my close friends or the people who come from Europe or come from <span class="country">France</span>, it immediately evokes something. </sentence><sentence id="1739">But then I have to go into the detail as to what <span class="populated place">Rivesaltes</span>, why <span class="populated

this lack of background to do it. </sentence><sentence id="1741">It's interesting. </sentence><sentence id="1742"> 2 When I went to <span class="country">France</span>, well, it just so happened that my husband was transferred to <span class="country">France</span> from "83 to "86. </sentence><sentence id="1743">So I retired from my -- I was teaching at <span class="building">Upstate Medical

id="1746">And my clinical practice as well. </sentence><sentence id="1747">So here I was having all this time, and I reconnected with people that I hadn't seen, with people I had worked with in the <span class="populated place">camps</span>, and so forth and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1748">And we put together our selected memories. </sentence><sentence id="1749">And it was wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="1750">And I was asked by a group I became active in <span class="building">WIZO</span>" -- which is the equivalent of Hadassah -- which I had never done, because I had never had time for this kind of thing. </sentence><sentence id="1751">But I was very happy to create an educational program for them, and a program of activities; and I was asked to talk about my war experience. </sentence><sentence id="1752">It surprised me. </sentence><sentence id="1753">But then I realized there's a new generation. </sentence><sentence id="1754">And they were mostly Jews from <span class="region">North Africa</span>, because the Sephardic community is so much bigger in <span class="country">France</span> today than it's ever been. </sentence><sentence id="1755">And these Jews had all been coming in the "S0s -- after the war -- and they didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="1756">Yet, at the same time, there was a physical closeness being there in <span class="country">Europe</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1757">And when I said "Rivesaltes," or when I say and name any place, there is some response, which made it easier for me to talk there. </sentence><sentence id="1758">And even to talk here. </sentence><sentence id="1759">And that, that's a reality. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1865">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1866">I'll probably think about it tonight. </sentence><sentence id="1867">I, I want to add that I always find it very difficult to do this, to give these talks in the first person. </sentence><sentence id="1868">And yet I know I've got to do it, because that's the only way people will I've had more people who have heard me talk in <span class="populated place">Chapel Hill</span> recently relate to exp-- pieces of experience. </sentence><sentence id="1869">Each one comes away with another little piece, not the whole. </sentence><sentence id="1870">And I think it's important, because I can -- personally, I cannot relate to anything that's fictionalized about the sho'ah,"* the television series on the sho" ah, or anything that's fictionalized in books or in the media, I just can't even watch. </sentence><sentence id="1871">To me, it's not the real stuff. </sentence><sentence id="1872">And so, I suppose that by my talking and sharing it with others, it's the real stuff. </sentence><sentence id="1873">And maybe something remains for them. </sentence><sentence id="1874">I feel that responsibility. </sentence><sentence id="1875">I really do. </sentence></p></dialogue>
