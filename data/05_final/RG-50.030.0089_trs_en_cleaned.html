<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="40">Uh...What kind of <span class="building">school</span> did you go to? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="41">A: The <span class="building">school</span> T attended was an <span class="building">orthodox school</span>]. </sentence><sentence id="42">real <span class="building">orthodox school</span>. _ </sentence><sentence id="43">Our teachers  still a baby, we moved from <span class="populated place">Essen</span> on the <span class="region">Ruhr</span> to <span class="populated place">Homburg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="44">In...uh...[ became a businessman and was even for myself in business until I had to give it up when Hitler came to power. </sentence><sentence id="45">And end of 1933, my father having passed away and buried now in <span class="populated place">Homburg</span>, I remained with my mother because my brother and my sister lived already in the <span class="region">East</span>. </sentence><sentence id="46">My...my sister married and my brother had to...in order to be...to be a doctor, practicing doctor, had to go there where he was born. </sentence><sentence id="47">He was...when he was born, it was <span class="country">Austria</span>, as I mentioned before, but it became after the first world...world war, <span class="region">Polish territory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="48">In 1933, I tried to go to the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="49">I had relatives there, an uncle, brother of my mother, and cousins. </sentence><sentence id="50">It was...I did not get an answer so that means I could not get any papers and go here...go to the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="51">So I decided in <span class="country">Germany</span> I cannot stay and I went to <span class="country">Poland</span> because my brother and sister lived there and they said there are three and a million Jews live. </sentence><sentence id="52">You can live too. </sentence><sentence id="53">When I came to <span class="populated place">Kolomier</span> where my sister lived, was a <span class="populated place">city</span> not far away from <span class="dlf">Rumania border</span>, and there I could make a living because I needed a <span class="region">territory</span> where there was industry. </sentence><sentence id="54">So I figured it out and I went to <span class="populated place">Katowice</span>. </sentence><sentence id="55">For two reasons. </sentence><sentence id="56">First of all, there was the so-called <span class="building">Polish industry</span>, and the other one was that I did not speak Polish and I could help myself with a lot of German and a little Polish. </sentence><sentence id="57">And I even went to an <span class="building">evening school</span> to know a little bit more of the language. </sentence><sentence id="58">I made a living, but in 39 we heard, in May 39, that there will come probably a war between <span class="country">Germany</span> and <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="59">So I decided to get out of <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="60">But, as I mentioned, before you couldn't go anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="61">I met a young man on the <span class="dlf">street</span> and I told him we had to talk. </sentence><sentence id="62">And I told him I think we get...have to get out from here, somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="63">So he just said..uh...(clearing throat) well, you have a Polish passport, you cannot go anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="64">You have the will to go, but nobody lets you in. </sentence><sentence id="65">A few weeks later I joined the party on advice of friends and thev told me that thev will  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection routine and went to the <span class="dlf">Rumanian border</span> and so we were reunited in <span class="populated place">Kolomier</span> altogether the whole family once more except my father who was not anymore alive. </sentence><sentence id="66">Thirteen or 14 days later the Russians came in. </sentence><sentence id="67">And I remember so well because they came with <span class="spatial object">tanks</span>, slowly in, and every second <span class="spatial object">tank</span> did not function. </sentence><sentence id="68">A few days later we saw <span class="spatial object">trains</span> going day and night out of <span class="country">Poland</span> with everything they could get...put their hands on and they were at that time making the Ribenthrow-Molotov Pact and felt obliged to give them food and assistance to lull everything that is..-uh...capitalist. </sentence><sentence id="69">Soon thereafter you had to stand for bread in <span class="dlf">line</span>. </sentence><sentence id="70">Everything was...you couldn't get. </sentence><sentence id="71">The businessmen were forced to sell everything they had for was declared as null. </sentence><sentence id="72">as..of no value. </sentence><sentence id="73">And when I looked at all these  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection were Jews that fled <span class="country">Poland</span> from the other side where the Germans came and they took them <span class="building">prison</span>...as prisoner anyhow if they didn't do anything either. </sentence><sentence id="74">Then 2 days later there was an other man with us who was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="75">His name was Mesha. </sentence><sentence id="76">He was very friendly and we...he said...we asked him what are you here doing...doing here. </sentence><sentence id="77">He said, "I am a leather cutter and I stole a little bit of leather. </sentence><sentence id="78">He gave me 2 years." </sentence><sentence id="79">But he used to get packages. </sentence><sentence id="80">He used to be very friendly, and he heard what we talked and up to the time when <span class="populated place">Paris</span> fell to the Germans that means somewhere in June or July...don't know exactly, we didn't know that people that are interrogators take nights out and I was not, as I told you before, I had a clear case what I am. </sentence><sentence id="81">A Zionist! </sentence><sentence id="82">They told me there were a lot of papers in different languages. </sentence><sentence id="83">He was very friendly...gave him cigarettes. </sentence><sentence id="84">in German. </sentence><sentence id="85">And...uh...looked to...looked to it that they should see that <span class="populated place">Paris</span> was taken by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="86">So he told them, "You see. </sentence><sentence id="87">Now the capitalist are gone. </sentence><sentence id="88">Now we will fight the fascist. </sentence><sentence id="89">That is our purpose." </sentence><sentence id="90">So he came back to the <span class="interior

class="building">church</span> of the <span class="building">Kiev prison</span> and told us we will judge...be judged now and get the sentence. </sentence><sentence id="92">I was called and there were three men sitting there, not dressed very nicely. , </sentence><sentence id="93">proud of it and said in Russian language. </sentence><sentence id="94">May I say it in <span class="interior

mention that because it was...at that time when I started to give a account, I had a <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="103">I had a family. </sentence><sentence id="104">I had a mother, a brother, a sister, relatives. </sentence><sentence id="105">And all probably looked where I am, hungry and almost dying. </sentence><sentence id="106">My body was going. </sentence><sentence id="107">It was my soul. </sentence><sentence id="108">My knowledge of my religion, my education from <span class="populated place">Homburg</span> that made me think I will survive, gave me hope. </sentence><sentence id="109">I used to cover myself and forget where I am and dreaming that today is holiday. </sentence><sentence id="110">The fourth Yom Kippur I was in a <span class="populated place">camp</span> because <span class="country">Russia</span> lost a lot of people at <span class="populated place">Stalingrad</span> and in the war at all, and they started to empty out <span class="building">prisons</span>...<span class="populated place">prison camps</span>, especially those people that could not work. </sentence><sentence id="111">And they want them out maybe to replace the men that were killed. </sentence><sentence id="112">So I was sent to a <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="113">There I was told I cannot go out. </sentence><sentence id="114">He looked at me and he said in Russian language, " ." </sentence><sentence id="115">He is such a bird. </sentence><sentence id="116">They don't know what to do with." </sentence><sentence id="117">There is such an expression in Russian, . </sentence><sentence id="118">Such a <span class="env feature">bird</span>! </sentence><sentence id="119">So I was sent back and a few days later I was called to the <span class="dlf">gate</span> and I was told to go take my few things, less than I brought here today. </sentence><sentence id="120">And there was a horse and <span class="spatial object">wagon</span> waiting and a woman was sitting on it. </sentence><sentence id="121">She's going to have a child. </sentence><sentence id="122">And I...and the...the man with the gun, ___, went with us to go to another <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="123">Could see it from far away. </sentence><sentence id="124">It was a <span class="populated place">workers" camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="125">In contrast to this <span class="populated place">camp</span> which was an assembly place for those they took eventually go out. </sentence><sentence id="126">I couldn't walk that far so I told him I cannot. </sentence><sentence id="127">I was sitting down in the <span class="env feature">snow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="128">I cannot. </sentence><sentence id="129">So he told the woman to go up...down, and put me up because the horse could not pull that much. </sentence><sentence id="130">Such a horse wasn't fat either. </sentence><sentence id="131">We finally arrived after | and a half hours there and there I was taken to the <span class="building">office</span> and in the <span

id="135">I'm 39 years old, and I..." And she said, "Take a look at the <span class="spatial object">mirror</span>." </sentence><sentence id="136">And it was the first time in many years that I saw a <span class="spatial object">mirror</span> and I didn't recognize myself. </sentence><sentence id="137">Being friendly to me...she was a___, she was a prisoner too. </sentence><sentence id="138">She told me...uh...] told her, "I'm hungry. </sentence><sentence id="139">I didn't get anything to eat from the morning til now. </sentence><sentence id="140">It's afternoon." </sentence><sentence id="141">She said, "I cannot give you anything I don't have." </sentence><sentence id="142">And it was Christmastime, and nobody was there of the high ranking. </sentence><sentence id="143">And she said, "Evenings when they give everybody to eat again." </sentence><sentence id="144">So I had to wait. </sentence><sentence id="145">And I got the piece of bread and I went. </sentence><sentence id="146">before that I went to the _ 39 called hognital of the <span class="building">camn</span> and told the doctor I  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection was rags was better than his, and he wanted me to exchange. </sentence><sentence id="147">But lucky enough towards evening...quite a bit of people came back from work and among them boys from <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>. </sentence><sentence id="148">Jewish boys from <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>. </sentence><sentence id="149">Oh, I said...and I am bad on Germans and working there. </sentence><sentence id="150">This is a <span class="populated place">working camp</span> and I will not go free. </sentence><sentence id="151">And that was very sad. </sentence><sentence id="152">But they had flour because they worked unloading flour and they brought flour with them. </sentence><sentence id="153">And they took water and flour and made it because our soup was watery. </sentence><sentence id="154">The spoon did not stand, but there the spoon stood. </sentence><sentence id="155">And they gave me as much as I wanted of flour and water and with a spoon to eat. </sentence><sentence id="156">And I told them about what the others do to me and they went over and told them, "You are talking here to soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="157">You will get it." </sentence><sentence id="158">And they let me go. </sentence><sentence id="159">Let me go. </sentence><sentence id="160">They called me uncle. </sentence><sentence id="161">Was 20.21 years boys that were expelled from <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>. </sentence><sentence id="162">Children of...probably of parents that once were from <span class="region">Galicia</span> and lived in <span class="populated place">Vienna</span> and the children are born there and they were prisoners there. </sentence><sentence id="163">What happens to them I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="164">Anyhow, after a short while I was called back to the other <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="165">When I came to the other <span class="populated place">camp</span> it was empty. </sentence><sentence id="166">Only a few people from...uh...which you see now on television from this..from those <span class="country">Republic</span> that wants to be by themselves. </sentence><sentence id="167">They...we had there to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="168">The food was not good. </sentence><sentence id="169">Again a piece of bread and that soup. </sentence><sentence id="170">So I had no other way. </sentence><sentence id="171">I lived everyday in and out, but I didn't go to <span class="building">work</span>. </sentence><sentence id="172">It was in February. </sentence><sentence id="173">It was Christmastime. </sentence><sentence id="174">It was in February. </sentence><sentence id="175">We didn't have the calendar. </sentence><sentence id="176">I cannot tell you exactly the date and it was very hard winter, of course there 40 below. </sentence><sentence id="177">And...uh...but one nice day, that is a nice day in 44, in March 44, I went somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="178">I went to the man of the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>, in charge and he was from White Russian, a Polish citizen from <span class="region">White Russia</span> and he wanted to learn how to speak German. </sentence><sentence id="179">So he will give me a little bit of bread and soup. </sentence><sentence id="180">So I spent my time with him. </sentence><sentence id="181">As soon as he didn't cook I spent my time with him. </sentence><sentence id="182">When I came back to the <span class="building">barrack</span>, "Where are you?
