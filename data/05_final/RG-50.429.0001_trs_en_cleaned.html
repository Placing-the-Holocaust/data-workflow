<body><dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1">And then he, and at that time it was suggested that it might be a good idea for us not to go to the Olympics. </sentence><sentence id="2">Because of all this, these problems that sort of register our objections and sort of boycotting the Olympics. </sentence><sentence id="3">And we were quite taken aback about that thought. </sentence><sentence id="4">They tried to explain to us that we would never regret if we did take that action, to boycott the Olympics and they suggested that we talk it over and let them know what, what our thoughts were, if we wanted any further discussion. </sentence><sentence id="5">And we, Norman Carnis and I went back and talked it over and thought we had discussed it with our parents as we had great respect for their judgment. </sentence><sentence id="6">And after talking it over with our parents, they also called Rabbi Levy to see what his thoughts were again. </sentence><sentence id="7">To get an explanation from him. </sentence><sentence id="8">And my father told me that he was satisfied and had confidence in Rabbi Levy's judgment and that we wouldn't regret it if we did boycott the Olympics. </sentence><sentence id="9">Of course the problem was, not the problem but the question was we, you know how imminent our selection onto the Olympic team would be. </sentence><sentence id="10">And I held the world's record in the high hurdles and also the <span class="building">Harvard- Yale</span> record in the <span class="dlf">broad jump</span>. </sentence><sentence id="11">And at that time and the Harvard-Yale broad jump event which I held the record in was over 24 feet, 11 inches. </sentence><sentence id="12">And I had been running in three events at that <span class="building">track meet</span> and the coach said not to take too many jumps because I had to save myself for the other events. </sentence><sentence id="13">And on the first try on the <span class="dlf">broad jump</span> I had fouled the take off, stepped over the <span class="dlf">mark</span>. </sentence><sentence id="14">And he said to be very careful on the next <span class="dlf">jump</span> because he didn't want me to take all my full <span class="dlf">jumps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="15">So on the next jump I was very careful and took off about a foot behind the take off <span class="spatial object">board</span> and I did 24 feet 11, so I was close to 26 feet in the actual jump. </sentence><sentence id="16">And they thought that I could, had a good chance of qualifying for the Olympics in the <span class="dlf">long jump</span>. </sentence><sentence id="17">Where I had the potential to go close to 26 feet. </sentence><sentence id="18">And in the high hurdles, which was the other event that I was, had qualified for, I had been running around 14, 9, 15 seconds in the high hurdles and the qualifying times were in the 14 second, probably 14, 2, or 3, but I was improving in the high hurdles and I practiced timing event, timing in the high hurdle practice rounds and I was This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="19">It is not the primary

getting closer to the 14, 5, 14, 4. </sentence><sentence id="21">And they felt that there was a good chance that I could make the team in maybe two events. </sentence><sentence id="22">But at any rate, after the discussion with Rabbi Levy and my parents and this whole situation about boycotting, both Carnis and I decided that we would boycott the Olympics and we didn't go into the finial tryouts. </sentence><sentence id="23">And although I was disappointed I felt that that was the thing to do and that's what basically happened, as far as boycotting the Olympics [were] concerned because that time I was a senior at <span class="building">Harvard</span> and I was interested in getting into business and whether to go into business right away, after graduation which was in 1936 or to go to <span class="building">graduate school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="24">And now I decided to go to <span class="building">Harvard Business School</span> and then go into the real estate business. </sentence><sentence id="25">So I was interested in looking, I was always interested in athletics. </sentence><sentence id="26">And I knew that I was a pretty good athlete and as I say I was captain of all the track teams since I was in <span class="building">grammar school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="27">But my focus after getting out of <span class="building">college</span> was not, had nothing to do really with athletics, although I was interested in all athletics and tennis and skiing and all the other activities. </sentence><sentence id="28">But I decided to go to the <span class="building">Harvard Business School</span> and then to go into business in the real estate business. </sentence><sentence id="29">And that's what happened and I was interested in, you know, finding a nice gal and getting married too. </sentence><sentence id="30">So that's the basic course that I followed. </sentence><sentence id="31">And after I got out of the <span class="building">business school</span> I participated in tennis. </sentence><sentence id="32">And I was ranked number six in <span class="region">New England</span> in the super senior category so I was always interested in athletics but that's really the basic story about what happened in the situation. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="66">Q: ...elaborate on some of those points...came from a Jewish background, identified as a Jewish boy. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="68">A: That's right, absolutely. </sentence><sentence id="69">My mother and father as say were Reform at that time. </sentence><sentence id="70">When I moved to <span class="populated place">Brookline</span> in 1925. </sentence><sentence id="71">But their parents were very religious, my mother's parents particularly because my father's parents weren't around at that time. </sentence><sentence id="72">But my mother's parents, the name was Waburn and they were very religious and we used to go over to their <span class="building">home</span>, to their <span class="interior space">apartment</span> and celebrate all the Jewish holidays. </sentence><sentence id="73">And as I say they were very religious and my parents were religious but they were Reform. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="80">Q: What about your friends, were your friends mixed or did you really grow up ina more <span class="dlf">Jewish environment</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="95">Q: Did you experience any anti-Semitism from your classmates or people when you were growing up? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="97">A: Not particularly. </sentence><sentence id="98"><span class="building">High school</span>, never noticed any. </sentence><sentence id="99">I knew it was around and there were situations but in <span class="building">college</span>, at <span class="building">Harvard</span> we lived <span class="populated place">Carnis</span> and I lived in <span class="building">Lowell House</span>. </sentence><sentence id="100">And they had <span class="interior space">common room</span> eating and we mixed with all of the, everyone there and we, we never noticed any particular anti-Semitism. </sentence><sentence id="101">But we knew it existed. </sentence><sentence id="102">But we were never particularly subjected to it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="109">Q: Do you think that sports in your early athletic career provided a good opportunity for you to fit into the <span class="dlf">main stream</span> and move beyond your <span class="dlf">Jewish environment</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="111">A: I never particularly thought of it in that way. </sentence><sentence id="112">But it was the focus that you know put us in contact with all the... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="115">Q: ...start the sentence by saying sports or athletics was the focus so that you say the subject in the sentence... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="117">A: Oh yeah, I see. </sentence><sentence id="118">You know sports and athletics were a focus. </sentence><sentence id="119">Because as I say I was captain of the team so I was, did pretty well in all the events. </sentence><sentence id="120">While it was a focus and I enjoyed it, it wasn't 100 percent focus. </sentence><sentence id="121">But I trained carefully and did all the training that the coaches had suggested but I would say it was a focus but not 100 percent so. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="127">Q: And you mentioned that you had worked toward going to the Olympics. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="129">Was that a real serious possibility in your mind? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="130">A: Yes, it was. </sentence><sentence id="131">Going to the <span class="spatial object">Olympics</span> was a very serious focus at that time and it was a focus on training and doing extra training and exercises too and I was watching the performances all over the world, in my particular events, particularly. </sentence><sentence id="132">And yes it was something that I was always thinking about when I was training and I had hoped to make the Olympic team. </sentence><sentence id="133">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="134">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="135"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="142">Q: So it must have been somewhat disappointing when, even though it was your choice, you weren't going to participate. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="144">A: It was my boycotting the Olympics through the meetings I had with Rabbi Levy, yes I was, I was disappointed. </sentence><sentence id="145">And felt that that focus that Thad had all these years was going to materialize but somehow or another I felt that it was the right thing to do and I never had any regrets about it one way or another. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="148">Q: What gave you that moral grounding? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="150">A: Well I don't think the moral grounding in relation to that was not really a basic factor. </sentence><sentence id="151">I don't think it had anything to do with moral grounding. </sentence><sentence id="152">It was just a realization that was something that should be done and I had great respect for Rabbi Levy because prior to our meeting with him, although I had heard about the problems in <span class="country">Germany</span> and what was going on, | didn't really have a detailed understanding of the problems there and that meeting was really a shocker to both <span class="populated place">Carnis</span> and myself. </sentence><sentence id="153">And it struck home to me that that was something I wanted to do after they explained the situation. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="158">Q: You talk about this meeting. </sentence><sentence id="159">Can you go into more detail about what they said to you and what helped you make this choice? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="162">A: Well the meeting with Rabbi Levy was at the <span class="interior space">Temple Israel executive boardroom</span>. </sentence><sentence id="163">And we weren't sure what he was going to tell us about what was happening in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="164">But the several board members of the men's committee and the rabbi went into pretty good detail. </sentence><sentence id="165">But I don't remember all the items that they discussed particularly, but they told us about the terrible things that were going on in <span class="country">Germany</span> and the Nazi regime. </sentence><sentence id="166">And it was a shocker to me and Norman Carnis and it just struck <span class="building">home</span> that it was something that we should do or consider doing. </sentence><sentence id="167">But I don't remember particularly all the gory details that they went into. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="174">Q: Do you remember any of the details? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="176">A: Not really. </sentence><sentence id="177">Something about book burning and taking away the rights of the Jews and putting them in <span class="populated place">ghettos</span> and I suppose it was -- I don't remember it was that time or afterwards, but they mentioned about the killing of Jews. </sentence><sentence id="178">And then all those details were pretty repulsive to us. </sentence><sentence id="179">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="180">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="181"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="188">Q: Were there at that point to your knowledge, press statements or public statements about boycotting and about <span class="country">Germany</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="190">A: Yes there were. </sentence><sentence id="191">There was publicity about the boycotting and discussions between the <span class="building">Olympic Committee</span> and there were some other groups that were, had mentioned in the press about they should boycott the Olympics. </sentence><sentence id="192">And there were other groups that said they shouldn't boycott the Olympics so I was just aware that there was a discussion going on about boycotting but I wasn't aware of all the details involved. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="196">Q: Were you aware of other athletes who were considering boycotting? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="198">A: Not particularly. </sentence><sentence id="199">I did, I wasn't aware of any other athletes that I knew of and I wouldn't be in contact with them other than through publicity in the papers. </sentence><sentence id="200">But I remember something about Stoller and those track athletes that were questioning about going to the Olympics but I don't particularly remember the time frame in connection with that but I do remember the discussion about it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="204">Q: Did the press and some of these organizations who were talking about boycotting influence you or.... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="206">A: No, I didn't think the press or the publicity influenced me one way or the other because I wasn't aware at that time in any great detail of the problems going on in <span class="country">Germany</span> and the Nazis with the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="207">I knew there were problems and it was serious but I wasn't aware of all the details. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="210">Q: When you decided to boycott was this primarily to take a stand or was there any concern about your safety in going over there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="212">A: No, I wasn't worried at all about safety but the reason I boycotted it was entirely a result of the meeting with Rabbi Levy. </sentence><sentence id="213">That was the essential dominant factor involved. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="216">Q: Did you consider this a substantial sacrifice on your part? </sentence><sentence id="217">I mean you had been working for this for a long time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="220">A: Well boycotting the Olympics was a sacrifice because I had always wanted to be in the Olympics but I didn't consider it as, once we made up our mind and I was aware of what was going on there, I didn't look at it particularly as a sacrifice, although it was. </sentence><sentence id="221">But I didn't consider it a terrible blow. </sentence><sentence id="222">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="223">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="224"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="230">Q: Once you made the decision to boycott, were you asked to or did you make any public statements in an effort to influence other people? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="232">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="233">We never made any public statements or indicated what steps we had taken. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="236">Q: When you were in a pretty high profile position. </sentence><sentence id="237">You were captain of <span class="dlf">varsity track</span> in <span class="populated place">Harvard</span>, I'm surprised that someone didn't come to you and say will you speak out for this boycott. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="240">A: Well after we boycotted the Olympics, no one came to speak to us or ask us if we'd make any statement about it and I don't think anyone knew particularly that we did boycott it. </sentence><sentence id="241">Cause there was no publicity about it one way or the other. </sentence><sentence id="242">The only publicity we had was when I spoke to the track coach at <span class="building">Harvard</span>. </sentence><sentence id="243">His name was Yacko Macola. </sentence><sentence id="244">He was the assistant coach but he was the -- in 1936 he was the track coach, and we told him about our intention and he tried to persuade us not to do it. </sentence><sentence id="245">He said he didn't think we'd do much good and we should try to go to the final tryouts and try to make the team. </sentence><sentence id="246">But we didn't want to do that. </sentence><sentence id="247">And that was the only conversation we really had about it, publicity wise. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="256">Q: ...-ask you about where you were during the games and....[tape ended and new tape began with the following.] </sentence><sentence id="257">When we stopped you were telling me that you and Norman Carnis, your roommate went and told your <span class="building">Harvard</span> track coach of your decision. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="260">A: That's right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="262">Q: Can you expand upon that a little? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="264">A: We, I went to see the <span class="spatial object">track coach</span>, Norman Carnis didn't. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="266">Q: Let me rephrase that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="268">A: All right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="270">Q: You went and told your coach who you had been working with at <span class="building">Harvard</span> of your decision. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="272">A: Yes, I told Yacko Macola. </sentence><sentence id="273">I went to see him and told him that we had decided not to go into the final tryouts. </sentence><sentence id="274">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="275">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="276"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="282">Q: ...say that again... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="284">A: Well I went to see, to tell my track coach at <span class="populated place">Harvard</span>, Yacko Macola, that we weren't going to go into the final tryouts and told him the reason that we had spoken to our religious leader, Rabbi Levy, and that we had decided because of the situation that we were told about that we weren't going to go to the final tryouts and he was quite disturbed -- not disturbed but felt that we should really go ahead and we've always wanted to be in the <span class="spatial object">Olympics</span> and he thought we had, that I had a great chance to qualify in two events. </sentence><sentence id="285">And that we, that I should really try to change my mind about going to the final tryouts but he didn't persuade us, persuade me rather. </sentence><sentence id="286">And that was the extent of the discussion with Yacko Macola, the coach. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="290">Q: Did other colleagues of yours on the track team at <span class="populated place">Harvard</span> go the Olympics or go to at least the final tryouts? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="292">A: None that I know of. </sentence><sentence id="293">There was no one else that had qualified for the final tryouts from <span class="building">Harvard</span>, except me. </sentence><sentence id="294">And I had no discussion with them at that time. </sentence><sentence id="295">We were, I think, having final exams and graduation around June 10C/ or 12*&gt;&gt; and I had no discussion with anyone about the final tryouts. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="300">Q: You were focused on sports; you were focused on your scholarship. </sentence><sentence id="301">You really weren't at that point -- it doesn't sound like that focused on being Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="302">And yet this meeting at your <span class="building">Temple</span> was very compelling to you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="306">A: Well, no, I was focused on being Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="307">I was focused on being Jewish because I felt loyal and loyalty to Judaism and I had no, we had contact with non-Jews in <span class="building">college</span> and everything but that wasn't a problem as far as I was concerned. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="310">Q: Let me ask you where you were at the time of the games? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="312">A: At the time of the Olympic games I was working at a <span class="populated place">summer camp</span> as a counselor up in <span class="region">Maine</span>, up in <span class="populated place">Waterville</span>, <span class="region">Maine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="313">It was called <span class="populated place">Cedar Crest Camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="314">And I don't think they had <span class="spatial object">television</span> at that time or they didn't have it at the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="315">But I remember of course eagerly reading the papers on the results and figuring out the times that they were winning the events in and the distances in the long jump. </sentence><sentence id="316">So I was following it very carefully but I didn't, I don't remember seeing them actually on TV, but I did later on, on the re-runs. </sentence><sentence id="317">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="318">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="319"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="330">A: Well we didn't go to the movies at <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="332">Q: The <span class="spatial object">radio</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="334">A: Yeah, I think we had, I think there was a <span class="spatial object">radio</span> we were listening to&gt; I don't remember what the time factor was between the events and the <span class="region">time zone</span> in <span class="populated place">Waterville</span>, <span class="region">Maine</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="336">Q: Do you remember how you felt as you were following the Olympics? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="338">Wistful? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="339">A: Yeah, I was, I was thinking about how it would have been to have been running in those events and now whether I could have been a medal winner and I was thinking in those terms but I didn't focus as far as actually winning the event at that time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="341">Q: Were you sorry you weren't there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="343">A: I suppose in a way I was because as I say I had been thinking about it for all those years, so I was in a way feeling that if I could have made the team and I thought I could that I would have liked to have been in that Olympic setting. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="345">Q: Isn't the Olympics a real dream? </sentence><sentence id="346">What does it mean to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="349">A: Well now that's the peak of training or one of the peaks, one of the objectives to be in the Olympics as I've gone to a lot of the Olympics to see it myself. </sentence><sentence id="350">In <span class="populated place">Los Angeles</span> and in <span class="country">Korea</span> and I'm going to the Olympics in <span class="populated place">Atlanta</span> this summer with my grandchildren and I always watch those track events with great interest. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="353">Q: Did you feel any resentment about the other athletes who chose to compete, especially the Jewish ones? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="355">A: No, I had no feelings about the Jewish athletes that competed. </sentence><sentence id="356">I didn't know them number one, but I had no feelings one way or the other about their competing, I mean that was up to them and I had no resentment at all about those that did go. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="359">Q: Do you think the American government should have made more of a stand? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="368">Q: Ineed you to say the American government. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="370">A: Well as far as the boycott is concerned, I think the American government definitely should have boycotted the Olympics in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> just like they boycotted the Russian Olympics and now they would have all the more of the facts than I ever had and I think it was definitely a mistake that they didn't boycott the Olympics in 1936. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="372">Q: Do you think it would have made a difference? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="374">A: Yes, I think it would have made a great difference to have the American government show their opposition to what was going on over there in the Nazi regime. </sentence><sentence id="375">I think they made a serious mistake not to boycott it and I know that there was a lot of talk pro and against the, boycotting the Olympics. </sentence><sentence id="376">But I think this is a result more in retrospect rather than at the time. </sentence><sentence id="377">But as I think of it now, I definitely think it was a mistake not to boycott it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="382">Q: Did you feel at all alone in your decision, as you were following the games? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="384">A: Well I had no recollection particularly of what my feelings were at that time in 1936. </sentence><sentence id="385">But it wasn't any great feeling that I had cause once I made up my mind and felt that it should be that I should go or try for the final tryouts, I didn't lose any sleep over that decision. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="388">Q: It's really hard for me to imagine that you had been training, that this was a real dream of yours and you made this decision for all of the right reasons but that you weren't a little bit torn apart by it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="390">A: No, I don't, as I remember it, I didn't, I don't remember being particularly torn apart. </sentence><sentence id="391">No, I had a longing and a desire to have been in it, but I didn't have as I look back on it, I don't remember having any terrible regrets for having made the decision. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="398">Q: Now let me ask you a sort of a different question. </sentence><sentence id="399">I think you made a pretty bold and moral decision, however you want to phrase it in 1936. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="409">Q: Did it encourage you when there were other tough decisions to take the <span class="dlf">high road</span>. </sentence><sentence id="410">Did you learn anything from it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="413">A: Well no, I don't think, I mean I felt good that I made the decision. </sentence><sentence id="414">But I don't, as I said I don't think it had any impact as far as my future activities or living or philosophies were concerned. </sentence><sentence id="415">It had no great impact one way or the other. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="419">Q: It's a long time ago. </sentence><sentence id="420">Do you ever think back on that period and what you went through at the time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="423">A: Yeah, I think back on making that decision and whether I would have on or not -- silver or gold or some sort of a medal and every time I go to the <span class="spatial object">Olympics</span>, I've been to three of them and I watch, I particularly watch the high hurdles and the long jump and I picture myself as maybe having won a medal on it, an Olympic medal. </sentence><sentence id="424">But I participated in the Senior Olympics in 1983 in <span class="region">Florida</span>. </sentence><sentence id="425"><span class="populated place">Florida</span> Senior Olympics and I won ten medals at that but that was not the real Olympics, that was the Senior Olympics. </sentence><sentence id="426">So I, you know I've won medals in Olympic senior competition. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="431">Q: Since that time you've heard and read a lot about the 1936 Olympics and the extent of the pageantry and the celebration and the propaganda and all of this. </sentence><sentence id="432">Do you think that sports can be separate from politics or that they're just inextricably linked in situations like that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="435">A: Well I think sports can be separated from politics. </sentence><sentence id="436">In a way they should be but it depends on what the separation is. </sentence><sentence id="437">I mean interference by the government, particularly in sports, I wouldn't like to see that but this is a, the boycotting is different, I don't consider that a mixing of sports and politics or a separation. </sentence><sentence id="438">I mean I think that's a moral ground and I just think that they should have been boycotted; the <span class="country">U.S.</span> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="439">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="440"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection should have boycotted it, not because it's -- there's separation of those activities. </sentence><sentence id="441">But I just think they should have just the way they did in the Russian Olympics. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="454">Q: Thank you. </sentence><sentence id="455">I think that's all my questions but I just want to make sure. </sentence><sentence id="456">Tell me about how this meeting came about. </sentence><sentence id="457">Who was there, why they called you in, what the atmosphere was like and what you did. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="462">A: Well I remember after the Harvard/Yale track meet, which Carnis and I won six gold medals there was quite a bit of publicity in the newspapers and there was a picture of Carnis and myself in the sport page. </sentence><sentence id="463">I forget which paper it was, and saying how we'd won six gold medals and I think they called us Damon and Pythias because we were such good friends. </sentence><sentence id="464">About three or four days after the track meet, I got a phone call. </sentence><sentence id="465">I forget what the fellow's name was but he said he was calling at the request of Rabbi Levy. </sentence><sentence id="466">And he was on the men's council of the <span class="building">Temple</span> and he had read about what we did at the Harvard/Yale track meet. </sentence><sentence id="467">And that he understood we were contenders for the Olympics and he had some important information that he'd like to talk to us about at the request of Rabbi Levy and as I had mentioned, Rabbi Levy was the head of <span class="building">Temple Israel</span> in <span class="populated place">Boston</span>, a <span class="building">Reform Temple</span>, and he was well- respected all over the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="468">And I was confirmed at <span class="populated place">Temple Israel</span> and naturally when they asked us to come, or asked me and Norman Carnis, we agreed to come and I think it was set for two or three days later. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="476">Q: What was going on in your mind, why they had called you over? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="478">A: He said something about he wanted to talk to us about the Olympics and so I wasn't particularly prepared, I didn't know what they were going to talk about. </sentence><sentence id="479">Except that something about the Olympics and we went to the <span class="interior space">boardroom</span> at the <span class="building">Temple Israel</span> on <span class="dlf">Commonwealth Avenue</span> in <span class="populated place">Boston</span>, that's where the <span class="building">Temple</span> was at that time. </sentence><sentence id="480">And we went there and they explained about the reason they wanted to talk to us was in connection with what was going on in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="481">And they explained the problems that were going on there with the Nazis and the terrible things that were happening to the Jews there This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="482">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="483"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection and I don't remember the exact details of exactly what items they were talking about but it was a terrible picture as I remember it and they discussed it fully and we told them that, I told them that I was preparing to go to the final tryouts. </sentence><sentence id="484">And that I'd qualified and had to get prepared for it and train again and they explained to me that again it was a terrible situation there in <span class="country">Germany</span> and they suggested that they thought it would be a very good idea to boycott the Olympics and they were quite sure that I'd never regret it. </sentence><sentence id="485">Even though I had my heard set on being in the Olympics and they suggested that you know it was up to me and Carnis decided what we wanted to do and so I told them that we'd talk it over and let them know what we wanted to do and that was the basic situation as far as that meeting is concerned. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="496">Q: And they really left it up to you that decision? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="498">A: that's right, they left the decision entirely up to us. </sentence><sentence id="499">They didn't say you had to or they indicated, they recommended strongly that it was the right thing to do and we would never regret making the decision. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="502">Q: Why was all this so compelling? </sentence><sentence id="503">You were excited, you were ready to go to the tryouts, the finals and that meeting really turned you around. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="506">A: Yes, that meeting really turned us around because we were horrified at what the terrible things that were going on in <span class="country">Germany</span> and we just felt it was the right thing to do and made up our mind to do it after as I say we, I talked it over with my parents. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="508">Q: After the meeting did you go immediately <span class="building">home</span>? </sentence><sentence id="509">Did you consult with your parents, or your friends? </sentence><sentence id="510">What took place next? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="514">A: Well I was living at the <span class="building">Lowell House</span> at <span class="populated place">Harvard</span> at the time with Norm Carnis and we went back and talked it over and decided that I'd go <span class="building">home</span> and talk things over with my parents, they lived in <span class="populated place">Newton</span>. </sentence><sentence id="515">And I went <span class="building">home</span> and talked it over with them and as I explained, my father called Rabbi Levy to find out if I had the right report. </sentence><sentence id="516">And after his discussion with Rabbi Levy, he felt that the rabbi had a complete understanding of the whole situation and he could rely on his judgment and that I should rely on his judgment and he said that you know left it up to me but he strongly recommended that I go along with the suggestion from the rabbi and the men's committee. </sentence><sentence id="517">I think the head of the Men's committee I think it was a fellow named Kimler or something close to it, or Kimmel or Kemla, it's some name like that. </sentence><sentence id="518">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="519">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="520"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="540">A: I don't remember the details of the times at that time. </sentence><sentence id="541">As I recollect now I think I could have made the team at two events -- the <span class="dlf">long jump</span> and the high hurdles. </sentence><sentence id="542">I'm pretty sure I could have done it in the long jump, I'm not that certain about the high hurdles. </sentence><sentence id="543">Because it depended on how much I improved at my timing there and really concentrating on that event, but I don't remember the details particularly. </sentence></p></dialogue>
