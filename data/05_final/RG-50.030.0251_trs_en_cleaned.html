</sentence><sentence id="169">The German Jews or non-Jews but because of the first column of spies. </sentence><sentence id="170">They were afraid of spies so they had orders to arrest all German men and he went to <span class="spatial object">bed</span>. </sentence><sentence id="171">He said he's sick. </sentence><sentence id="172">And he said go and call your parents and tell your father to do the same. </sentence><sentence id="173">And I don't remember anymore that they didn't have a <span class="spatial object">phone</span> I just see myself running through the <span

to do the same. </sentence><sentence id="174">And they wouldn't believe me. </sentence><sentence id="175">They said ah stories are . .. </sentence><sentence id="176">you know. </sentence><sentence id="177">We weren't use to doing things like that. </sentence><sentence id="178">Everything had to be on the up and up. </sentence><sentence id="179">So he didn't do it and two days later they made

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="373">A: The Germans. ( </sentence><sentence id="374">The Germans?) </sentence><sentence id="375">Oh yes, was all Germans. </sentence><sentence id="376">And uh they put us on the uh, they said yes, go down to the <span class="dlf">plaza</span>. </sentence><sentence id="377">There were lots of <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> and of these <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> are going to , to to a <span class="populated place">town</span> near, in <span class="country">Belgium</span> already but near <span class="populated place">Brussels</span> and they will take you. </sentence><sentence id="378">So, cause you know, sixteen year old girl they all wanted to have in, during the war, they wanted me to sit in front with one and the other, my mother and the other and the Matulskis were in the back of another <span class="spatial object">truck</span>, but we were all together. </sentence><sentence id="379">I wouldn't leave them. </sentence><sentence id="380">You know, I said we have five people and we go together. </sentence><sentence id="381">So we got into and uh we stayed overnight with a with a Belgium family. </sentence><sentence id="382">They put us up but we didn't, we were really you know as Germans. </sentence><sentence id="383">They hated the Germans and we  5 dressmaking, you know. </sentence><sentence id="384">To order. </sentence><sentence id="385">People came and brought their fabrics and so I really learned it there, learned a lot from them to do to do fine sewing and to do fittings and to do that's really where I got my first apprenticeship so to speak, with those two ladies. </sentence><sentence id="386">And uh my mother was able to make a little bit money and we didn't need very much and we finally got our uh the <span class="spatial object">lift</span>, this this box with things from <span class="country">Germany</span> we got them out and uh out of the uh out of the they had been in the <span class="building">warehouse</span> all the time (in <span class="interior space">storage</span>?) </sentence><sentence id="387">In <span class="interior space">storage</span>, yes... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="404">Q: What was in the <span class="spatial object">box</span>? </sentence><sentence id="405">What did you have? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="408">A: There was a very ingenious way of packing. </sentence><sentence id="409">They had made to order <span class="spatial object">boxes</span> like like uh <span class="interior space">closets</span> and you know, on the one side were some clothes and then there were <span class="spatial object">shelves</span> on the <span class="spatial object">shelves</span> and then, they were sometimes as big as a small <span class="interior space">room</span> but it was all one great box. </sentence><sentence id="410">So I don't remember any more exactly but I think my mother had uh uh <span class="spatial object">table</span> service that she was able, that we were able to sell and some crystal. </sentence><sentence id="411">No silver. </sentence><sentence id="412">No silver. </sentence><sentence id="413">No gold. </sentence><sentence id="414">That had to be brought to Hitler you know we had to, they allowed us two uh <span class="spatial object">table</span> settings silver a person, one for milk and one for supposedly. </sentence><sentence id="415">And uh, but  6 about us, they you know, that _ I'm not going to register. </sentence><sentence id="416">And this other lady, this Mrs. Matulski, said no, we have we have to, they're going to send us to work you know. </sentence><sentence id="417">We cannot do against it. </sentence><sentence id="418">Too dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="419">And she did register, but we never did. </sentence><sentence id="420">So time wore on and it got a little bit worse and worse. </sentence><sentence id="421">All of a sudden it started with people catching people on the <span class="dlf">streets</span> or deportations. </sentence><sentence id="422">And they, on the <span class="dlf">street</span> they took anybody that had this, you know. </sentence><sentence id="423">They went on <span class="spatial object">trolley cars</span>. </sentence><sentence id="424">They went in the front and in the back of <span class="spatial object">trolley cars</span>, the SS, and nobody could escape and they went through all the people and we had, we had identification papers, Jews. </sentence><sentence id="425">But from the lists that been registered they went from <span class="building">house</span> to <span class="building">house</span> and you know, they had the addresses. </sentence><sentence id="426">They had the people. </sentence><sentence id="427">It was very easy. </sentence><sentence id="428">They went and picked them up. </sentence><sentence id="429">So they sent them letters that they have to report, and it said for work only for labor. </sentence><sentence id="430">But my mother got around and they started to get rumors to rumors already that specially girls that they put girls in <span class="building">whore houses</span>, that they used the Jewish girls for the soldiers and that's all she had to hear. </sentence><sentence id="431">So she wasn't going to let us down. </sentence><sentence id="432">We weren't going to go to any forced labor and we didn't. </sentence><sentence id="433">But then one day this lady got the letter. </sentence><sentence id="434">She has to report then and then for labor. </sentence><sentence id="435">It always said for labor. </sentence><sentence id="436">So uh she came, the boy came running to us. </sentence><sentence id="437">Mrs.Blochman, my mother wants go to <span class="populated place">labor camp</span> and please help us. </sentence><sentence id="438">I don't want to go and so my mother went over there and she said start packing. </sentence><sentence id="439">They lived with a family that had a <span class="building">grocery store</span> downstairs and she had sent the girl away in the <span class="country">country</span> with, to the family of these people they became pretty well friendly with them. </sentence><sentence id="440">And you and will go away like here is punctual and you can go under  7 the meantime in <span class="country">France</span> had started the deportations already. </sentence><sentence id="441">And the people like my father and, they were in this <span class="populated place">French camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="442">had come and the  8 they, but we got through that. </sentence><sentence id="443">So we got the little <span class="interior space">hotel room</span> and we stayed overnight and then when they, I think next morning, we went for breakfast into like a <span class="building">cafe</span>, you know, this little <span class="populated place">French town</span>, and we were all sitting around and here comes, in a round, ina round <span class="spatial object">table</span> with the children, and here comes the <span class="spatial object">SS</span>, comes in and looks because we weren't the only ones. </sentence><sentence id="444">I mean that the way to <span class="country">Switzerland</span> and we weren't the only ones going to <span class="country">Switzerland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="445">And they were trying uh to catch as many as possible but they didn't want to make uh very big thing out of it so they just went, came into the <span class="building">cafe</span> and looked and looked and our hearts stood still. </sentence><sentence id="446">It was like you know, like you're frozen in time. </sentence><sentence id="447">You know, we don't and then he looked at each other and he said no, I don't think there are any here. </sentence><sentence id="448">And they left you know. </sentence><sentence id="449">And you die a little bit at a time. </sentence><sentence id="450">So that was really the closest we came with the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="451">And then this young man told us uh we're coming very close to the <span class="dlf">Swiss border</span> now and they are even more vigilant and more uh you know, so he won't go. </sentence><sentence id="452">He doesn't want to jeopardize the this <span class="interior space">underground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="453">You know, they don't want him to, and we are on our own now. </sentence><sentence id="454">But we should look in this <span class="populated place">village</span> there on the French uh <span class="dlf">Swiss border</span>, we should look around and ask for a guy named Gerard (ph) and Gerard will take us over the <span class="dlf">border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="455">He knows we are coming and he will take us over. </sentence><sentence id="456">Well, we got off the <span class="spatial object">train</span> didn't go to this <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="457">We got off before and we were afraid to go all on the same <span class="spatial object">bus</span> so we sent this lady with the smaller children on the <span class="spatial object">bus</span> and mother and I were walking. </sentence><sentence id="458">And we were walking on the <span class="dlf">highway</span> with our little <span class="spatial object">attache case</span> and two women it looked kind of in in city clothes after all, and we looked a little bit conspicuous I guess. </sentence><sentence id="459">So the French gendarme stopped us. </sentence><sentence id="460">And he really questioned us. </sentence><sentence id="461">Questioned our papers and he heard as a Frenchman more than the Germans that our French wasn't up to par and we said well, we are from and we always spoke German but well, it was a long story and but finally my mother said, look, uh you hate the Germans don't you. </sentence><sentence id="462">And he said yes, I hate the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="463">I said more than you hate the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="464">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="465">So, she said, what do you want from us. </sentence><sentence id="466">Let us take our chances. </sentence><sentence id="467">You know, she didn't tell we're Jews, we're not Jews. </sentence><sentence id="468">So he says OK. </sentence><sentence id="469">I'll, he let us go. </sentence><sentence id="470">So we went to this <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="471">We came to this <span class="populated place">village</span> and we couldn't locate Gerard. </sentence><sentence id="472">And wherever we asked for Gerard they just froze. </sentence><sentence id="473">The people froze up. </sentence><sentence id="474">So we stayed one night and there was a lot of German soldiers in this <span class="populated place">village</span> and we were very scared. </sentence><sentence id="475">So we said, well, we have to get out of here because here they will catch us. </sentence><sentence id="476">So here we started walking again, and we walked up the <span class="dlf">highway</span> and we came up to a little <span class="building">country inn</span>. </sentence><sentence id="477">So we got in there and we asked for two <span class="interior space">rooms</span> for the two families and there we were. </sentence><sentence id="478">And I think that people knew who we were. </sentence><sentence id="479">You know in German we have a saying when you die and you don't leave any money for the funeral, he says we're going to smell him out. </sentence><sentence id="480">You know, it's going to smell. </sentence><sentence id="481">They're going to have to bury us with a . </sentence><sentence id="482">So we're going to sit here until we smell, till  9 They gave us uh old aprons like this farm women are wearing and they hid, they put us on the <span class="spatial object">hay wagon</span> and the, the children, they were hiding in the hay and they gave us milk cans. </sentence><sentence id="483">You know there were milk canson _ like we were farmers" women that were going on the, coming <span class="building">home</span> from uh milking cows or something. </sentence><sentence id="484">And they hiding our little bit of <span class="spatial object">luggage</span> under the hay and they took us back; the <span class="dlf">highway</span> that was the way was back to the <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="485">Oh, I forgot to tell, I went back one day with this young man, with this with this boy, to the <span class="populated place">village</span> to ask again for Gerard, and I found out that he had been arrested. </sentence><sentence id="486">That's why everybody was so afraid to even mention his name. </sentence><sentence id="487">So we went back, they had to go back to this <span class="populated place">village</span> in order to get to the <span class="dlf">border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="488">And the letter carrier, they went around the dinner hour when the <span class="building">German border patrol</span> was having dinner and they knew exactly by observation what time, but still, to make sure, the letter carrier on his <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> went right in front of us, ahead of us to make sure that we don't run into any patrols or anything. </sentence><sentence id="489">So he went ahead and we came on that <span class="spatial object">hay wagon</span> and they brought us to the <span class="dlf">farm</span> right on the <span class="dlf">border</span> and we got out and we got, each got a glass of milk yet and that was the <span class="dlf">farm</span> was like a hundred years ago and | can still see it and they said well, that's as far as we can go. </sentence><sentence id="490">You go down here in the back of us is like a <span class="env feature">ravine</span> and there's a little <span class="env feature">brook</span>. </sentence><sentence id="491">We go over the <span class="env feature">brook</span> but there is <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span>. </sentence><sentence id="492">You have to go through this <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span> or over or under or whatever, and on the other side is <span class="country">Switzerland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="493">Good luck. </sentence><sentence id="494">So that little girl had a pacifier and we, we went down this <span class="env feature">ravine</span> and we went over the <span class="env feature">brook</span> and we went up the other side and that little girl lost her pacifier and started screaming bloody murder, but we still made it and we came over the <span class="dlf">border</span> and uh but the Swiss border guard had heard her all the way across and he came and he helped us and you know, and we were kind of happy, but my mother said let's go, let's go little bit further in. </sentence><sentence id="495">They can still send us back, and you know, we'll celebrate later. </sentence><sentence id="496">So we got but he was good. </sentence><sentence id="497">In the meantime in the beginning of the deportations, the Swiss didn't let anybody in. </sentence><sentence id="498">And they turned back a lot of people. </sentence><sentence id="499">But in the meantime, we came a little bit later already, the public opinion had forced them to take them in, especially women and children and we had no man with us, so he wasn't going to turn us back anyhow. </sentence><sentence id="500">So he took us, I don't think to another <span class="building">hotel</span> by the way. </sentence><sentence id="501">He took us to a little, to, to a <span class="populated place">town</span> where there was a bigger uh <span class="building">police headquarters</span> and uh we stayed overnight and we had he stayed with us and he even watched us when we went to the <span class="interior space">bathroom</span>. </sentence><sentence id="502">He stood in front of the <span class="interior space">bathroom</span>. </sentence><sentence id="503">I mean he didn't let us get out of sight and uh my mother said by the way, we're not free. </sentence><sentence id="504">They watch us. </sentence><sentence id="505">They treat us nicely but we're not going to stay. </sentence><sentence id="506">So we tried to call our relatives in <span class="populated place">Zurich</span> but we couldn't uh commu.., there was no communication. </sentence><sentence id="507">I don't remember any more. </sentence><sentence id="508">We couldn't tell them that we were in <span class="country">Switzerland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="509">So uh we told them of course right way that these papers are false, and we gave them our right papers, our right names. </sentence><sentence id="510">We had no papers to the effect but we gave them our right names and and everything and they were OK. </sentence><sentence id="511">I  0 to the I don't remember anymore but they uh we spoke enough French to know that the <span class="building">prison</span> is a <span class="building">prison</span> is a <span class="building">prison</span>, but it was a different word it was different they said a different word that we didn't understand. </sentence><sentence id="512">Well, we understood pretty soon, pretty quick. </sentence><sentence id="513">We came to this <span class="building">prison</span> that must have been five hundred years old. </sentence><sentence id="514">The keys were this big. </sentence><sentence id="515">They had you know, thick <span class="dlf">walls</span> and thick and they, right away they separated this lady from her family. </sentence><sentence id="516">They took the son. </sentence><sentence id="517">He was only ten or twelve years old. </sentence><sentence id="518">They took him to stay with other men and she and her daughter went in one <span class="interior space">room</span> and mother and I were in another in another <span class="interior space">cell</span>, and uh as a matter of fact the first <span class="interior space">cell</span> had only one <span class="spatial object">bed</span> and we didn't know how, so we slept like this, like sardines. </sentence><sentence id="519">We had funny things that happening too you know. </sentence><sentence id="520">like I said the key was so big and the <span class="dlf">key hole</span> was that big too, so I was laying in <span class="spatial object">bed</span> like this and all of a sudden I said mother, somebody is looking at me, somebody is looking at me. </sentence><sentence id="521">She said who's going to look. </sentence><sentence id="522">So anyhow there was a prisoner outside that had it wasn't you know a <span class="building">penitentiary</span> or anything. </sentence><sentence id="523">It was an old <span class="building">jail</span> where people was kept and all of a sudden I see, there comes a knife with a pad of butter through this <span class="dlf">key hole</span>. </sentence><sentence id="524">And this was apparently in __ or something that could order his own food in there and he had wonderful breakfast and he wanted us to have a pad of butter. </sentence><sentence id="525">Oh, we had all kinds of . . . </sentence><sentence id="526">then we heard singing. . . </sentence><sentence id="527">Hebrew songs, Jewish songs, singing. </sentence><sentence id="528">And there was another group of refugees. </sentence><sentence id="529">They wanted us to know that they are there. </sentence><sentence id="530">You know, they couldn't communicate with us any different way, so we heard this singing and so when the regular prisoners were, they had time out in the morning to make their <span class="spatial object">beds</span> and to empty their <span class="spatial object">sinks</span> (ph) and so you know they kept us in the <span class="interior space">cells</span>, but when they were, when the regular prisoners were in their <span class="interior space">cells</span> during the day, then they kept us, we could go out in the <span class="interior space">hallways</span>. </sentence><sentence id="531">And they were great big <span class="interior space">hallways</span> with and we met with the other refugees and you know, it wasn't so bad. </sentence><sentence id="532">And we, we got food and we uh the <span class="interior space">basement</span> they had <span class="interior space">bathtubs</span>. </sentence><sentence id="533">We could even take a <span class="interior space">bath</span>. </sentence><sentence id="534">And not everyday but you know, they were very nice. </sentence><sentence id="535">But the food of course wasn't too great so my mother was always afraid that I was going to starve you know, the regular Jewish mother.
