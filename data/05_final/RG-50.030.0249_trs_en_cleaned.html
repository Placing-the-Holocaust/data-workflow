<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="42">Q: Were most of your friends Jewish, or did you have a lot of Gentile friends as well? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="44">A: We were very friendly with our neighbors, most of whom were not Jewish, and we played together with them. </sentence><sentence id="45">And the <span class="building">schools</span> I went to were mostly non-Jewish people, non-Jewish teachers, non-Jewish friends. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="48">Q: So you went to <span class="building">public schools</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="50">A: To a <span class="building">public school</span> first, and afterwards to a kind of <span class="building">gymnasium</span> which is called an oberealshure (ph). </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="52">Q: So you were very comfortable in the general <span class="populated place">community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="53">That was your world? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="56">A: We felt very comfortable. </sentence><sentence id="57">We were not one of the richest, but we made a living. </sentence><sentence id="58">And my father was respected as a very good mechanic. </sentence><sentence id="59">People came to him with repairs and bought <span class="spatial object">bicycles</span> from us. </sentence><sentence id="60">And my mother was, so to say, the bookkeeper and taking care of the things. </sentence><sentence id="61">And she had the very good handwriting. </sentence><sentence id="62">At that time we hadn't <span class="spatial object">typewriters</span>,  and people came from far and wide and had her write letters. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="70">Q: Were you involved in cultural activities or community activities? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="72">A: To a certain extent, with the <span class="building">synagogue</span>. </sentence><sentence id="73">We went to the <span class="building">synagogue</span>, and I had religious lessons there in the afternoon, because we did not have a <span class="building">day school</span>, a <span class="building">Jewish day school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="74">So I went in the afternoon. </sentence><sentence id="75">And besides this, I was very friendly with some people, some youngsters who lived a little further out in <span class="populated place">Bremen</span>, a <span class="populated place">suburb</span> called <span class="populated place">Hammerlichen</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="76">And those Jewish people whom I saw there, it was a two hours walk, but I went on the weekends several times. </sentence><sentence id="77">They were mostly from <span class="country">Poland</span>, and they had settled there. </sentence><sentence id="78">There was a difference in the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span> between what they call the <span class="dlf">ost stuent</span> (ph) and the <span class="dlf">west stuent</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="79">And I felt very comfortable with the ost stuent (ph), too. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="88">Q: Did -- were you involved in any political organizations? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="90"> A Not really, but I remember that sometime before Hitler came to power, 1932, I remember, I was associated of going with the Zionist organization. </sentence><sentence id="91">And in the Zionist organization, it was more leftist. </sentence><sentence id="92">And I did not like this, because they are very close to Communism, and I did not like it, and I left. </sentence><sentence id="93">And some 30 or 40 other youngsters left with me, and we joined a different organization. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="98">Q: This was also a <span class="building">political organization</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="100">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="101">It was not really a <span class="building">political organization</span>. </sentence><sentence id="102">It was more or less a <span class="building">religious organization</span>, a of <span class="country">Israel</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="106">Q: What did you do in that <span class="building">organization</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="108">A: We tried to teach people something about Judaism. </sentence><sentence id="109">And we also tried them how to behave in the Nazi -- during the -- in the Nazi time. </sentence><sentence id="110">And, but we were not political in that sense. </sentence><sentence id="111">We did not want to join any political movement. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="116">Q: Judaism was quite important to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="118">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="119">It was very important to me, because despite the fact that my father was not very religious and my mother came from a religious family. </sentence><sentence id="120">But I felt more religious. </sentence><sentence id="121">And especially through teachers whom I had there in the <span class="building">Jewish religious school</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="126">Q: And at this time, prior to 1933, there were never any obstacles to you expressing your Judaism? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="128">A: No, not to me. </sentence><sentence id="129">However, to my parents. </sentence><sentence id="130">And I remember that already in 1928 when we went for a trip to the <span class="dlf">park</span> near <span class="populated place">Bremen</span>, the Nazis were very influential, and they just had  received 107 people, I think, 107 members in the <span class="building">parliament</span>. </sentence><sentence id="131">And they came into the <span class="spatial object">car</span> where we were riding, into the <span class="spatial object">street car</span> where we were riding, and my mother was very much afraid that Jewish life in <span class="country">Germany</span> would become different, which it did. </sentence><sentence id="132">And I saw many times that -- that the Nazis had in mind to exterminate all the Jews, especially in the <span class="building">non-Jewish school</span> where I went, they sometimes ridiculed me and they said to me, "Go back to <span class="country">Jordan</span>, go back to <span class="country">Palestine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="133">You don't belong here." </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="140">Q: These were other students? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="142"> A Students, yeah, from the <span class="building">non-Jewish school</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="144">Q: And this was all prior to -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="146">A: This was even prior to Hitler. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="148">Q: So you were -- you were fairly aware of Naziism before Hitler came to power, then? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="150">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="151">But we never thought that he would get power, because the largest party in <span class="country">Germany</span> were the social democrats. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="154">Q: So how did all of this start escalating when Hitler came to power? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="156">A: When Hitler came to power in January 1933, we listened to the <span class="spatial object">radio</span>, and we thought that it would only last a little while. </sentence><sentence id="157">Because we had non-Jewish friends living near us, and they told us, "Don't worry, it will only last a little while, and it cannot go on this way. </sentence><sentence id="158">It will stop." </sentence><sentence id="159">However, by that time, many youngsters and many other people had joined the party. </sentence><sentence id="160">Some of them joined the party even though they were not 100 percent convinced about Hitler and had no -- much belief in him. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="166">Q: Why did they join the party? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="168">A: They knew things would change. </sentence><sentence id="169">And there were different reasons, because of the political speeches which Hitler made, because of blaming the Jews for having mishandled and brought <span class="country">Germany</span> into such a mishap, like the S.I. and all kinds of things, you see. </sentence><sentence id="170">And they blamed the Jews on it, because that was one thing in order to get the -- to unite the party against Jews. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="174">Q: So did you sense that the people in your <span class="populated place">town</span> started to believe this and believe in all of this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="176">A: There were some people who did not believe it. </sentence><sentence id="177">In <span class="populated place">Bremen</span>, even more than <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="178"><span class="populated place">Hamburg</span> was more Communistic at that time than <span class="populated place">Bremen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="179"><span class="populated place">Bremen</span> was still, when they had the elections in 1933, 64 percent social democrat. </sentence><sentence id="180">And many times, I saw Nazis coming to our <span class="building">store</span> who told me, "I'm really a Communist. </sentence><sentence id="181">But I have to cover it up,  because if they ever found out, they would send me to the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>," because they already had <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span> in 1933. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="188">Q: So you didn't feel that it was going to be this serious? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="190">A: We felt -- we felt that every day had got more serious. </sentence><sentence id="191">Because in the very beginning, when they had the seven states -- seven days of celebration, when Hitler came to power, afterwards when they had the Reister (ph) fire, the burning of the <span class="spatial object">ragster</span> (ph) at the end of February. </sentence><sentence id="192">And then finally, when on April Ist, they had the first progrune, (ph) the day of solidarity, they called it, when -- which happened to be on the Sabbath. </sentence><sentence id="193">And Jews were not allowed to go out. </sentence><sentence id="194">Non-Jews could go out. </sentence><sentence id="195">So we really felt it was very bad. </sentence><sentence id="196">Also, they forbade right away Schreichter (ph), that means slaughtering according to Jewish custom. </sentence><sentence id="197">So we felt it was getting bad. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="206">Q: Now, how did the attitudes of your friends, your teachers, start changing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="208">A: In the beginning, they still came to our <span class="building">business</span>. </sentence><sentence id="209">But as time went on, when Hitler made a law that all the parties were prohibited, except the Nazi national party, national socialist. </sentence><sentence id="210">And anyone who joins Jews, who talks to Jews, then they slowly kept away from Jews, from us. </sentence><sentence id="211">And it happened before, you see, that they tried to do something against it that we should not have business anymore, and take away the business from us. </sentence><sentence id="212">It happened. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="218">Q: Can you -- do you have specific memories of situations with good friends of yours who were not Jewish, or your teachers, how they started changing toward you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="220">A: There were many changes. </sentence><sentence id="221">Let's talk about, if I may, so talk about our neighbor. </sentence><sentence id="222">We had a neighbor who had also -- who had been placed there by the Nazis and had also a <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> and <span class="building">repair shop</span>. </sentence><sentence id="223">And he didn't know very much about the business. </sentence><sentence id="224">He came to my father, and my father taught him and gave him business and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="225">One day, the Nazis told him to build a high <span class="dlf">wall</span> near our <span class="building">house</span>, so high that we could not look out anymore, completely close our <span class="dlf">windows</span>, just in order to take away business from us, even though he came to us and he wanted to -- he needed it, because he didn't know too much about the mechanics. </sentence><sentence id="226">Regarding the youngsters, the children, more or less, they were forced to join the Hitler Youth. </sentence><sentence id="227">And as soon as they joined the Hitler Youth, they were not allowed to have any more contact with Jewish people, with me and others. </sentence><sentence id="228">But the teachers, if that's what you are asking me, were different. </sentence><sentence id="229">The teachers were a different generation, the generation before. </sentence><sentence id="230">And they felt that it was not right to do this. </sentence><sentence id="231">And quietly taking me apart, they told me about it. </sentence><sentence id="232">But not publicly. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="246">Q: So for a while, you still were in the <span class="building">public schools</span>, the teachers were kind to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="248">A: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="249">Q: Things didn't change too much initially? </sentence><sentence id="250">A No. </sentence><sentence id="251">In fact the teacher told me at that time in 1934, they made a law that Jewish children, especially orthodox Jewish children, were no longer allowed to go to <span class="building">school</span> on Sabbath. </sentence><sentence id="252">They used to do this. </sentence><sentence id="253">And when they went to <span class="building">school</span> on Sabbath, they would not write, would not take <span class="spatial object">baggage</span> along. </sentence><sentence id="254">Now they said, "If you come to <span class="building">school</span>, you have to do everything." </sentence><sentence id="255">So I went to my teacher and I said to him, "I don't want to come any more on Sabbath." </sentence><sentence id="256">He said to me, "Why don't you want to come anymore?" </sentence><sentence id="257">So I said to him, "You know, when Hitler came to power, Hitler wanted Germans to know about their background as Germans, to give them a certain sense of identity, according to what he thinks is the identity. </sentence><sentence id="258">So I want to go a little bit back to my own identity to being Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="259">I want to be more Jewish now. </sentence><sentence id="260">You want to be more Nazi; I want to be more Jewish." </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="273">Q: This was brave in 1934. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="275">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="276">And then the teacher told me, "What I will do to you is, whatever I teach on the Sabbath, I will tell the students to give you the notes. </sentence><sentence id="277">And besides this, on Sabbath, I will teach them Mein Kampf, Hitler's book, so you won't be there." </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="281">Q: Why do you think the teachers -- was this a risk for the teachers? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="283">A: It was a certain risk. </sentence><sentence id="284">But they did not do it publicly. </sentence><sentence id="285">They put on the Nazi emblem, which was like a life saver, double ring, with a swastika in it. </sentence><sentence id="286">And the teacher told me I had to put this on. </sentence><sentence id="287">This is my life saver. " </sentence><sentence id="288">They are taking away my job," and many jobs from teachers were taken away. </sentence><sentence id="289">The principal of my <span class="building">school</span> where I went, non-Jewish, was retired, and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="290">The teachers at that time were about between 50 and 60 years old. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="299">Q: I'm trying to get a sense of how all this started changing. </sentence><sentence id="300">And my guess is that every year it certainly got worse in terms of your ability to spend time with your Gentile friends, or your teachers" relationships with you. </sentence><sentence id="301">How did life start changing? </sentence><sentence id="302">Do you remember any specific people or instances? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="307">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="308">We were good friends with people, neighbors. </sentence><sentence id="309">And there were some young people. </sentence><sentence id="310">We came together; we played together. </sentence><sentence id="311">There was a <span class="interior space">yard</span>, what they call a <span class="interior space">playground</span> like this, not far from us. </sentence><sentence id="312">And we played together with them. </sentence><sentence id="313">And everything was fine. </sentence><sentence id="314">I even went on bicycle tours with some of these people and everything was fine. </sentence><sentence id="315">I even have a picture at <span class="building">home</span> where I am in this picture with the neighbors, the non-Jewish people who were with us. </sentence><sentence id="316">They were all very nice to us. </sentence><sentence id="317">However, it changed because everyone was forced -- two things. </sentence><sentence id="318">They were forced number one to join the Hitler Youths. </sentence><sentence id="319">And number two, they were forced to tell the Hitler Youths of what their parents thought about the Nazis at <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="320">And so slowly it infiltrated to the parents and to others, you see. </sentence><sentence id="321">And they felt it was not safe anymore to talk to Jews. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="337">Q: And they stopped talking to you? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="338">A: Slowly, they stopped talking to us. </sentence><sentence id="339">Then later on, they started to avoid us by walking on the other side of the <span class="dlf">street</span>, or by just not talking to us. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="340">Q: Were they ever abusive or violent? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="342">A: No, not in the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="343">But you could not complain, because there were still people there who were of the old type. </sentence><sentence id="344">And I remember that one day I went to the -- a fair, which they had in <span class="populated place">Bremen</span> nor far from us, and they showed a puppet show. </sentence><sentence id="345">And in the puppet show, they showed how the one person went against the Jews, boop, boop, boop. </sentence><sentence id="346">So I asked a policeman there, which actually was stupid of me. </sentence><sentence id="347">But I asked the policeman, "Why do you show such shows?" </sentence><sentence id="348">You see, "Why do they show such shows here," you see. " </sentence><sentence id="349">The Jews are also people." </sentence><sentence id="350">He didn't answer, because the answer was simply, "Because this regime is against the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="351">That's why we have to infiltrate the public, and we have to make them aware that Jews are different. </sentence><sentence id="352">And they have to be done away with." </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="364">Q: As time went on, were you ever hurt or abused in any way? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="366">A: Not directly. </sentence><sentence id="367">But I remember that one day, when I was in <span class="populated place">Wurzburg</span> and I went <span class="building">home</span> from the <span class="building">school</span> to the <span class="building">dormitory</span>, the boys came and they took away my hat. </sentence><sentence id="368">And they threw it up, and they tried to hurt and beat me. </sentence><sentence id="369">And, but I was lucky. </sentence><sentence id="370">Somehow I got this hat back. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="376">Q: Were you ever afraid? </sentence><sentence id="377">Did your parents start getting fairly worried about the situation? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="380">A: My mother was very much afraid of this situation. </sentence><sentence id="381">And my father, too. </sentence><sentence id="382">But, so we started quite early, 1934, "35, or even before that, to find relatives or people all over in the world, wherever we thought we had some people. </sentence><sentence id="383">Because some of my mother's relatives had gone to <span class="country">Israel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="384">Some had gone to <span class="region">South America</span>. </sentence><sentence id="385">And my father, <span class="country">Russia</span> was out of the question. </sentence><sentence id="386">To find out if they would be able to help us getting out, because we want to get out. </sentence><sentence id="387">And the only way, especially after the Nuremberg laws, 1935, and then 1936, they made it like imperative to move out. </sentence><sentence id="388">We couldn't stay there anymore, because the <span class="building">business</span> got worse. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="398">Q: Was your father's <span class="building">business</span> closed down? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="400">A: Eventually, you see. </sentence><sentence id="401">They made very little -- they earned very little in that <span class="building">business</span>. </sentence><sentence id="402">And they had something like what's called a community project whereby they collected food and so on. </sentence><sentence id="403">And we even had to use some of this food in order to live, you know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="408">Q: Now, you graduated from <span class="building">public school</span>, yes? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="410">A: Yeah, even later. </sentence><sentence id="411">I graduated from some kind of <span class="building">high school</span> in 1936. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="412">Q: And then you went -- then you went onto -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="413">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="414">Then 1936 when I graduated from there, through the help of a teacher, a Jewish teacher in <span class="populated place">Bremen</span>, I went to <span class="populated place">Frankfurt am Main</span>. </sentence><sentence id="415">And I was in <span class="populated place">Frankfurt am Main</span> for one year. </sentence><sentence id="416">We considered this, like, instead of military service, Jewish service, you see, because many people there prepared what they called Hashra (ph), which means preparation for moving out to <span class="country">Israel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="417">At that time it was very difficult even to go to <span class="country">Israel</span> because it was under <span class="region">British dominion</span>, and the British didn't want anyone there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="423">Q: So you went to -- you went to this <span class="building">school</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="425">A: In <span class="populated place">Frankfurt</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="427">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="428">And things -- were things more difficult, less difficult there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="431"> A In <span class="populated place">Frankfurt</span>, contrary to <span class="populated place">Bremen</span>, we lived in a Jewish -- more of a <span class="dlf">Jewish environment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="432">And at that time, we did not feel so much about what the <span class="region">outside world</span> did. </sentence><sentence id="433">But we read, of course, the papers. </sentence><sentence id="434">But from <span class="populated place">Frankfurt</span> after one year, I went to <span class="populated place">Wurzburg</span>, which was a <span class="building">teacher's seminary</span>. </sentence><sentence id="435">And this <span class="building">teacher's seminary</span> was not far from the <span class="dlf">railroads</span>. </sentence><sentence id="436">And there, I saw every day <span class="spatial object">trains</span>, <span class="spatial object">freight trains</span>, dozens of them, covered up with tarpaulin, with machine guns, moving to the <span class="region">front</span>, to <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>, to <span class="country">Poland</span>, to all kinds of countries. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="443">Q: What did you make of that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="445">A: So we thought -- of course, this was done secretly. </sentence><sentence id="446">But we knew or we thought that this was a preparation for war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="449">Q: Of course, now, you were thinking about war. </sentence><sentence id="450">You weren't necessarily thinking about <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="453">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="454">You see, at that time we knew there were <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="455">Because already in 1933, "34, "33, when they had the <span class="building">Sachsenhausenbergerhomme</span> (ph), we heard from friends of ours, Jewish friends, that they had received urns of ashes from <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="456">And it said, "This person was killed while trying to flee," or, "This person committed suicide," or, "This person had been ill." </sentence><sentence id="457">And so we knew something was going on there, but we didn't really know what was going on there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="463">Q: Do you -- do you have memories of any of the book burnings or any of some of the more violent outbursts? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="465">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="466">I remember the book burning was early in May 1933. </sentence><sentence id="467">And just because of curiosity, I wanted to go and see it. </sentence><sentence id="468">So I went out, it was in the evening, about 9:00, 10:00 o'clock, I  went out to this big place where they had all the books and they were burning the books. </sentence><sentence id="469">And I was standing from afar. </sentence><sentence id="470">And I saw all of the -- thrust all of the books into this <span class="spatial object">bookcase</span>, into this fire and burned them. </sentence><sentence id="471">So I saw the book burning. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="479">Q: This was in <span class="populated place">Bremen</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="481">A: In <span class="populated place">Bremen</span>, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="483">Q: What did you make of it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="485">A: I only thought, "They don't know what they are doing." </sentence><sentence id="486">Because these were some of the most intelligent people, you see, that burned the books. </sentence><sentence id="487">They probably don't know anything about these books, you see, just to burn it. </sentence><sentence id="488">I say, by burning books, you cannot really do much, because other <span class="country">countries</span> have the book. </sentence><sentence id="489">And so the books wouldn't get lost. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="495">Q: Was it frightening at all? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="497">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="498"><span class="country">Europe</span> was frightening. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="501">Q: Do you have memories of <span class="building">shops</span> closing down, or any other violent outbursts prior to Kristallnacht? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="503">A: Prior to Kristallnacht, we had in <span class="populated place">Bremen</span> what we called great big <span class="building">department stores</span>. </sentence><sentence id="504">And there were two or three <span class="building">department stores</span> in the main <span class="dlf">streets</span> in <span class="populated place">Bremen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="505">And they had actually built <span class="building">department stores</span> which were new at that time, you see, were the newest kind. </sentence><sentence id="506">There was one <span class="building">department store</span> by a Jewish person who had for the first time this <span class="spatial object">escalators</span>. </sentence><sentence id="507">They didn't have <span class="spatial object">escalators</span> before. </sentence><sentence id="508">And this went up to the <span class="interior space">fourth floor</span>, the <span class="spatial object">escalators</span>. </sentence><sentence id="509">And people went there a lot, just because of the <span class="spatial object">escalators</span>, I think, <span class="building">Jewish department store</span>. </sentence><sentence id="510">And they were closed and taken over by non-Jews. </sentence><sentence id="511">Or if they were not taken over directly by non-Jews, a non-Jew was made the chief manager of that <span class="building">department store</span>. </sentence><sentence id="512">I think it was <span class="populated place">Bamberger</span>'s <span class="building">department store</span>, if I remember, and certain others. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="523">Q: Did -- I mean, did this make it more difficult to start getting things to have a normal life? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="525">Not just the <span class="building">store</span>, but in general? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="526">A: We tried to live a normal life as much as was possible. </sentence><sentence id="527">And we tried to get out of <span class="country">Germany</span> as soon as possible and to find some way of living. </sentence><sentence id="528">You could not change, because since we had this <span class="building">business</span>, and my father knew this <span class="building">business</span>, and we were helping him in this <span class="building">business</span>, that was a way, you see, we could make a living. </sentence><sentence id="529">You couldn't just change and do a different job. </sentence><sentence id="530">Because eventually he was thrown out of the , which means the <span class="building">trade union</span>, and all kinds of things. </sentence><sentence id="531">And they even tried to -- to find something out against him, like they came in and they bought certain  things. </sentence><sentence id="532">And then they said, "These things were stolen." </sentence><sentence id="533">And they want to accuse him of having stolen these things. </sentence><sentence id="534">They came in and buying things at a different price, and just to say, "He oversells, he overprices," and things of this sort. </sentence><sentence id="535">But thank God, he was -- they couldn't put anything on him, you see. </sentence><sentence id="536">But they tried. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="549">Q: How did you all combat this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="551">A: It was very hard, very hard. </sentence><sentence id="552">I was not then so much involved anymore in the business, because I was living away, outside, away from <span class="populated place">Bremen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="553">And I was more in a <span class="dlf">Jewish environment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="554">But my mother felt very bad about it. </sentence><sentence id="555">And my father, too. </sentence><sentence id="556">And they tried to handle the situation as best as could be. </sentence><sentence id="557">And with the little they had, they continued. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="565">Q: Tell me a little bit about Kristallnacht. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="567">A: Actually, Kristallnacht did not start at Kristallnacht. </sentence><sentence id="568">It started, I think, on the 28th of October, when a number of students from the <span class="building">school</span> where I had been at that time were of Polish descent, and they were sent away. </sentence><sentence id="569">And that's where the story of Herschel Grynszpan comes in. </sentence><sentence id="570">They were sent away. </sentence><sentence id="571">First they were sent to a <span class="building">prison</span> in <span class="populated place">Wurzburg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="572">And we went there and we threw packages of food in there, and we tried to help them. </sentence><sentence id="573">And we tried to tell them so-and-so. </sentence><sentence id="574">Then when the Germans and the Poles concluded their contract, I mean, the negotiations, then suddenly it stopped. </sentence><sentence id="575">And the <span class="spatial object">trains</span> which had been sent to <span class="country">Poland</span> was like this: A part of the <span class="spatial object">train</span> in <span class="country">Germany</span>, they could go back to <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="576">The part of the <span class="spatial object">train</span> in <span class="country">Poland</span>, they could stay in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="577">Even the Polish were just as much anti-Semitic as the Germans, maybe more. </sentence><sentence id="578">And the people in the middle were in <span class="region">No Man's Land</span>. </sentence><sentence id="579">And that's where Herschel Grynszpan came. </sentence><sentence id="580">But two weeks later on November 9th, the 10th, was the Kristallnacht. </sentence><sentence id="581">No one thought of this. </sentence><sentence id="582">What happened is this: On the day before Kristallnacht, we were studying in <span class="building">school</span> for a test which should have been the next day. </sentence><sentence id="583">And I had already been a student and a teacher in this <span class="building">school</span> at the same time, because I spoke a little bit of Spanish, so I gave a little bit Spanish classes in <span class="building">school</span> from October to November. </sentence><sentence id="584">And then in the night it happened, I went <span class="building">home</span> early on that evening, because I wanted to study some more. </sentence><sentence id="585">And besides this, I wanted to have a good night's sleep for the test the next day. </sentence><sentence id="586">You want to hear more about that? </sentence><sentence id="587">So we went to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="588">Then in the middle of the night, about 2:30 or 3:30, I don't remember anymore the time. </sentence><sentence id="589">I think it was -- it was the night that I remember, the middle of the night. </sentence><sentence id="590">We heard noise coming in, into the <span class="building">dormitory</span> where I stayed, which was in this little side <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="591">And I woke up my colleagues, and I said to them, "What shall we do? </sentence><sentence id="592">There is noise. </sentence><sentence id="593">Shall we go and find out where the noise comes from?" </sentence><sentence id="594">So we waited, and we heard -- the noise got louder. </sentence><sentence id="595">So I said to them, "Let's make sure we are safe." </sentence><sentence id="596">So the <span class="dlf">window</span>, there was a <span class="dlf">window</span> in the <span class="interior space">room</span> on the top, barricaded so we couldn't even go through that <span class="dlf">window</span>. </sentence><sentence id="597">Outside, there was a <span class="interior space">hallway</span>. </sentence><sentence id="598">And outside the <span class="interior space">hallway</span>, there was a <span class="dlf">yard</span>. </sentence><sentence id="599">So I said to them, "The best thing is we get dressed now. </sentence><sentence id="600">And if anything should happen, we are ready to encounter whatever there is." </sentence><sentence id="601">And I said, "Let's get our <span class="spatial object">bags</span> ready, if anything should happen." </sentence><sentence id="602">And then I said, "Let's maybe hide under the -- under the <span class="spatial object">bed</span>, or in that <span class="interior space">corner</span>." </sentence><sentence id="603">And then I decided, "No, we don't --  0 shouldn't hide. </sentence><sentence id="604">We should just meet it head-on." </sentence><sentence id="605">So there was a <span class="dlf">door</span>, one <span class="dlf">door</span>, with a little lock. </sentence><sentence id="606">First I tried to lock it, but then I said, "It's no use. </sentence><sentence id="607">If they come, they come." </sentence><sentence id="608">And they did come. </sentence><sentence id="609">They made a lot of noise. </sentence><sentence id="610">They came in, and they saw our <span class="spatial object">suitcases</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="611">And they said, "Take these <span class="spatial object">suitcases</span> and throw them against the <span class="dlf">window</span>." </sentence><sentence id="612">They wouldn't fall outside the <span class="dlf">window</span> anyhow, because the <span class="dlf">windows</span> were barricaded. </sentence><sentence id="613">Then he said, and I said to them, "What shall we do?" " </sentence><sentence id="614">Stay here and wait until we give you orders. </sentence><sentence id="615">And you should know, we never even bent a hair of a Jew, and we won't do it this time. </sentence><sentence id="616">But eventually, you will all be exterminated," something like that. </sentence><sentence id="617">I don't know if they said the exact words. </sentence><sentence id="618">So we waited, then said, "What should we wait for? </sentence><sentence id="619">Let's go <span class="interior space">downstairs</span>." </sentence><sentence id="620">That was on the <span class="interior space">second floor</span>. </sentence><sentence id="621">We went through the <span class="interior space">hallway</span>, and we saw in the big -- there was another dormitory place. </sentence><sentence id="622">We were on a small <span class="interior space">side room</span> with <span class="spatial object">lamps</span> hanging down. </sentence><sentence id="623">They just took their swords, or whatever they had, and cut off the electric lamps that were hanging down. </sentence><sentence id="624">They cut the <span class="spatial object">faucet</span> so that the water was just coming out. </sentence><sentence id="625">And they said to us, "Go <span class="interior space">downstairs</span>." </sentence><sentence id="626">There was a non-Jewish janitor. </sentence><sentence id="627">And he said to us, "You better get dressed and get ready, because we don't know what's going to happen," because they didn't tell anyone else. </sentence><sentence id="628">Then the caretaker of the <span class="building">house</span> thought it would be good idea to go to the police and tell them what happened. </sentence><sentence id="629">But that was a joke, because going to the police, they just kept him there. </sentence><sentence id="630">He never came back, and probably afterwards was sent to <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="631">Then the woman of the <span class="building">house</span> downstairs said, "What I will do," it is 4:00 o'clock in the morning, 4:30, "I will make some coffee for you. </sentence><sentence id="632">I will give you something to eat." </sentence><sentence id="633">And she did. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="701">Q: This was a non-Jewish woman? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="703">A: Yes, it was a non-Jewish woman. </sentence><sentence id="704">There was also Jewish woman there, both. </sentence><sentence id="705">Then we said, "Let's wait and see what's going to happen." </sentence><sentence id="706">The people who had come into the <span class="building">house</span>, 10, 20 people, left. </sentence><sentence id="707">And there was quiet. </sentence><sentence id="708">But the non-Jewish janitor said to us, "They will come back." </sentence><sentence id="709">And they did come back. </sentence><sentence id="710">About 6:00, 6:30, they came back. </sentence><sentence id="711">And they told -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="721">Q: Excuse me, this is the same morning? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="723">A: This is the same morning. </sentence><sentence id="724">On November 10th, it was a Thursday morning, they came back. </sentence><sentence id="725">And the Nazis who were not dressed in Nazi uniform, because they wanted the people to believe it's the foixvut (ph), the anger of the people. </sentence><sentence id="726">And this does not come from the party, but comes from the plain civilian people. </sentence><sentence id="727">They were in civilian clothes. </sentence><sentence id="728">They told us, "Get a little bit together." </sentence><sentence id="729">We thought we should pack all of this. " </sentence><sentence id="730">No, don't worry. </sentence><sentence id="731">You will come back." </sentence><sentence id="732">Of course, it wasn't true, you see. </sentence><sentence id="733">So we took a few things along, and they said, "All of you assemble in this <span class="interior space">corner</span>." </sentence><sentence id="734">And so we assembled in that <span class="interior space">corner</span>. </sentence><sentence id="735">And then about 7:30 or so, they said to us, "Now let's go and march." </sentence><sentence id="736">They marched about three or four, maybe even six in a <span class="dlf">line</span>. </sentence><sentence id="737">We were about -- I don't even remember how many people there were. </sentence><sentence id="738">But there were 50, 60 people or more. </sentence><sentence id="739">And we walked, it's a narrow <span class="dlf">street</span>, through this narrow <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="740">And we walked toward the <span class="building">prison</span> they led us. </sentence><sentence id="741">And while we were going through the <span class="dlf">street</span>, the populace, the people were  1 standing at the side. </sentence><sentence id="742">I think they were all Nazis, because they spit at us, and they threw stones at us and all kinds of -- and they made noise and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="743">We went through the <span class="dlf">street</span> and we passed by the <span class="building">synagogue</span>. </sentence><sentence id="744">We saw the <span class="building">synagogue</span> burning. </sentence><sentence id="745">And we went all the way, and <span class="populated place">Wurzburg</span> is a <span class="populated place">city</span> where there used to be a <span class="building">palace</span> of the Bavarian king. </sentence><sentence id="746">We passed by there, and they led us to the <span class="building">prison</span>. </sentence><sentence id="747">And they were -- the Germans were very methodical. </sentence><sentence id="748">When you came in, they took a picture of you, on the right side, from the left side, from the front. </sentence><sentence id="749">And they took all your money, or all kind of things which you had in your pocket. </sentence><sentence id="750">And they made a complete record of it. </sentence><sentence id="751">They were very meticulous. </sentence><sentence id="752">They were very orderly in that sense. </sentence><sentence id="753">And they gave it to us, and they said, "Sign here." </sentence><sentence id="754">Okay, we signed. </sentence><sentence id="755">Then they led us into <span class="interior space">cells</span>, <span class="interior space">prison cells</span>. </sentence><sentence id="756">And I was in <span class="interior space">prison cell</span> number 99, I think. </sentence><sentence id="757">And there were about 15 boys in that <span class="interior space">prison cell</span>. </sentence><sentence id="758">They put us in there, in the <span class="interior space">water cell</span>. </sentence><sentence id="759">And there was, like, a <span class="spatial object">toilet</span>, a <span class="spatial object">bowel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="760">And there were <span class="dlf">windows</span> on top, with iron bars. </sentence><sentence id="761">And there was -- I don't think anything else, maybe a few <span class="spatial object">mattresses</span> or so. </sentence><sentence id="762">And in the <span class="dlf">door</span> was a little <span class="dlf">window</span>. </sentence><sentence id="763">And through this <span class="dlf">window</span> they gave us food about an hour later, like <span class="env feature">water</span> with a few beans in it and things like that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="805">Q: How long were you in this <span class="building">prison</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="807">A: From that Thursday until the next Thursday, eight days. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="809">Q: It was fairly -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="811">A: And we always thought we would all be sent away. </sentence><sentence id="812">Because every morning and every evening, they took us all out. </sentence><sentence id="813">Once a day, they led us around the <span class="interior space">prison yard</span> to give us a <span class="building">prison</span> walk for an hour. </sentence><sentence id="814">And then they led us all out, and they read a list of names to make sure everyone was still there. </sentence><sentence id="815">And every day, the number had come less. </sentence><sentence id="816">And we imagined, because no one told us, that they probably were sent to <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="817">And then came the last day of the seven days. </sentence><sentence id="818">They called us a list. </sentence><sentence id="819">They called us a list, and they read all the names. </sentence><sentence id="820">Then they read seven names, and I was among the seven whom they read. </sentence><sentence id="821">And they said to them, "Stay at the side." </sentence><sentence id="822">We stayed at the side. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="835">Q: What were you thinking? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="837">A: I didn't know what they would do with us. </sentence><sentence id="838">I think they would send us to <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="839">But what happened was, all the others were sent to <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="840">And these seven, I among them, was stateless. </sentence><sentence id="841">And they said to us, "You are stateless, and we are going to send you away," not telling us where. </sentence><sentence id="842">So I thought maybe they send me to <span class="country">Russia</span>, because my father came from <span class="country">Russia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="843">And I said to myself, "It's better to be in <span class="country">Russia</span> than to stay here," even though I didn't know that at that time it was just as bad. </sentence><sentence id="844">And I already made up my mind to go to <span class="country">Russia</span>. " </sentence><sentence id="845">Within 24 hours I will be in <span class="country">Russia</span>." </sentence><sentence id="846">That was at noon-time then. </sentence><sentence id="847">Then they came back in the evening, and they called us again, the seven people. </sentence><sentence id="848">And they said, "Go <span class="interior space">downstairs</span> and report to the <span class="building">office</span>, the <span class="building">prison office</span>." </sentence><sentence id="849">I know now that all the others were sent to <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span> because they wanted to empty the <span class="building">prison</span> of all the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="850">All people under 15 and over 60 were  2 sent <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="851">They only kept the people between 15 and 60, I think. </sentence><sentence id="852">So when we came <span class="interior space">downstairs</span>, they told us, "You are free. </sentence><sentence id="853">Sign this." </sentence><sentence id="854">And they gave us back all the things which they had taken away from us. </sentence><sentence id="855">They were very meticulous. </sentence><sentence id="856">And they said, "Return within 24 hours to your <span class="populated place">home cities</span>, and report to the Gestapo." </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="877">Q: Now, how did this feel? </sentence><sentence id="878">I mean, it must have been a fairly strange feeling that you were so close to being sent away. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="881">A: I didn't -- I felt -- I said, "Whatever is going to happen to us, we cannot do much about it. </sentence><sentence id="882">We can maybe pray a little bit," and that's what we did while we were together in this <span class="interior space">cell</span>. " </sentence><sentence id="883">But what can we do? </sentence><sentence id="884">We hope for the best, you see, and we know bad things -- bad things are going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="885">We hope that a miracle or something would happen, and things will change for us." </sentence><sentence id="886">Well, it was very bad, and nothing helped us. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="895">A: We felt very bad about the other people that were sent away. </sentence><sentence id="896">And we hoped that maybe they wouldn't have to stay there such a long time. </sentence><sentence id="897">At that time, they had <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>, but they did not do the killings in such large measures as afterwards. </sentence><sentence id="898">They killed a few people, as I mentioned before. </sentence><sentence id="899">They sent the <span class="spatial object">urns</span> to those people about -- Jews and non-Jews. </sentence><sentence id="900">I even know non-Jews whose <span class="spatial object">urns</span> they had sent away, back to them, to family. </sentence><sentence id="901">So we thought -- and beside this, when we came out, we knew that Greppels (ph) had called off -- Gurling (ph) had called off the sending away the Jews on the day afterwards. </sentence><sentence id="902">It didn't make much difference. </sentence><sentence id="903">I only felt, I only thought that maybe I would come <span class="building">home</span> and I would see what's going on there. </sentence><sentence id="904">But for eight days we didn't know what was going on in the world because we were completely separated from any news. </sentence></p></dialogue>
