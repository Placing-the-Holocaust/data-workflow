<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="163">Q: Tell me about how your life changed when the war broke out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="165">A: Well, at the beginning when the Germans came into our <span class="populated place">hometown</span>, they let us for a while be in our <span class="building">houses</span>, everything was like never nothing happened yet. </sentence><sentence id="166">Then one summer morning, early morning, they knocked on everybody's <span class="dlf">doors</span>, and they made everybody get out of the <span class="building">houses</span>, and who wouldn't leave, they shoot right there. </sentence><sentence id="167">So they got us all out on the <span class="dlf">streets</span>, and they started marching us, and right next to us, the Gentile people were marching with shovels. </sentence><sentence id="168">Now we couldn't understand what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="169">Because nobody said nothing, and then we see the German soldiers walking, and make us march. </sentence><sentence id="170">So, our <span class="populated place">city</span> was divided by a <span class="dlf">railroad</span>. </sentence><sentence id="171">It was like a new <span class="populated place">city</span> and an old <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="172">So we marched over the <span class="dlf">bridge</span>, and way out of the <span class="populated place">city</span>, outskirts of the <span class="populated place">city</span> like in a big <span class="dlf">field</span> and there were already Germans with the machine guns all around standing and we got in the middle. </sentence><sentence id="173">And they told us to sit down and wait. </sentence><sentence id="174">And we sit there and we couldn't understand anything, nothing, and those people with the shovels, they probably went to dig <span class="dlf">ditches</span> already to kill us or something. </sentence><sentence id="175">We didn't know what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="176">Because it was the first time. </sentence><sentence id="177">So, late afternoon, they told us women and children separate, men separate. </sentence><sentence id="178">They started separating everybody. </sentence><sentence id="179">And there was one nice soldier, and he walked over and he says the women with the children will live. </sentence><sentence id="180"> That is all he said. </sentence><sentence id="181">And we still didn't know what he meant. </sentence><sentence id="182">So, by that time everybody who had three or four kids started dividing between the people who didn't have kids. </sentence><sentence id="183">So then they marched the men away first. </sentence><sentence id="184">And nobody knew where they had taken them and what they would do with them. </sentence><sentence id="185">Then 20 minutes later, they told all the women, "Line up and start marching towards the <span class="populated place">city</span>." </sentence><sentence id="186">So we were told to separate again, as soon as we cross, we got in the middle halfway in the <span class="dlf">road</span>, and they told us to run. </sentence><sentence id="187">And everybody started to run into <span class="building">houses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="188">Whatever <span class="building">house</span> they saw, they just ran. </sentence><sentence id="189">And right after we got into the <span class="building">houses</span>, we could hear shooting and we more exactly, you know, understood that something was happening. </sentence><sentence id="190">And nobody knew where the men were or nothing until late evening they came back. </sentence><sentence id="191">They took them to <span class="building">armory</span> like, a <span class="building">armory</span> for soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="192">They took them there. </sentence><sentence id="193">They made them work for awhile, and then they let them go. </sentence><sentence id="194">And that was the first that they did. </sentence><sentence id="195">And right after that, they made a <span class="building">Judenrat</span>--an <span class="building">office</span>, where you have to register to go work. </sentence><sentence id="196">They came there and they asked for people to work and everybody started working. </sentence><sentence id="197">And they were young, young kids. </sentence><sentence id="198">We had to wear first a Jewish star on our arm, like an arm band. </sentence><sentence id="199">That was not good enough for them because they couldn't tell if you were Jew or not because the right arm band didn't show much. </sentence><sentence id="200">So they told us to wear a yellow circle in the back of our back and in front. </sentence><sentence id="201">And I, myself, was not allowed to work, I had been going to work every day, and worked different places and once I was taken to work on a <span class="building">railroad station</span> with some other girls. </sentence><sentence id="202">We had to carry small bombs. </sentence><sentence id="203">And the SS were standing with the whips, and if you didn't pick it up and take it on the <span class="spatial object">train</span>, you were whipped. </sentence><sentence id="204">And it was very bad. </sentence><sentence id="205">Then, a few months later, they organized a <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="206">They took one part of the <span class="region">section</span> and all the Jews went to this part of the <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="207">And they put in like 2 or 3 families in a <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="208">And they had a <span class="dlf">gate</span>, and you had to go in through the <span class="dlf">gate</span> and come out through the <span class="dlf">gate</span>. </sentence><sentence id="209">And then, one day they came, with a <span class="spatial object">truck</span>, to mobilize all the young people. </sentence><sentence id="210">They never came with the <span class="spatial object">truck</span> to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="211">They always went to the <span class="building">office</span>, and then we have to come there and then go to work. </sentence><sentence id="212">So when I saw the <span class="spatial object">truck</span>, I said to myself, "I am not going." </sentence><sentence id="213">For some reason, I had a feeling that something was going to be wrong. </sentence><sentence id="214">So I said "No, I am not going." </sentence><sentence id="215">My mother didn't insist for me to go either. </sentence><sentence id="216">She says "You don't want to go, don't!." </sentence><sentence id="217">So they had on the front of the <span class="building">house</span>, like an empty <span class="building">store</span>, was bombed, you know, and they came in, and I crawled in there and I sit in there, and I watched through the broken wood pieces. </sentence><sentence id="218">I could see the <span class="spatial object">truck</span>, and they were loading up as many as they could. </sentence><sentence id="219">They put one on top of another, and I knew that something was wrong, and those people never came back. </sentence><sentence id="220">We later found out they were taken to the <span class="env feature">woods</span> and shot. </sentence><sentence id="221">And life was going on for awhile like that, and I was working different places. </sentence><sentence id="222">Once they took a group of girls and three men to a <span class="building">school</span>, to a <span class="building">gymnasium</span>, to make ready the <span class="building">school</span> for the soldiers who had to come into <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="223">We had to put straw on the <span class="interior space">floors</span>, clean it. </sentence><sentence id="224">The men were chopping wood to make a fire, and one German was watching us. </sentence><sentence id="225">One German was watching us. </sentence><sentence id="226">They never left us alone. </sentence><sentence id="227">So after we finished, we told them we finished, and we free to go? </sentence><sentence id="228">He said, "No, we have to stay and wait for the soldiers." </sentence><sentence id="229">So, I said, "No, something is going to happen when the soldiers come in." </sentence><sentence id="230">So I say to the girls, "We have to run." </sentence><sentence id="231">They say, "How can we run, the soldiers here." </sentence><sentence id="232">I said, "I get rid of them." </sentence><sentence id="233">I went outside and I told the men to come out for a minute and keep him busy. </sentence><sentence id="234">I told him why and we could get away. </sentence><sentence id="235">And while he was there, we run out and we run into the <span class="building">office</span>, to the <span class="building">Judenrat</span>, and we told the man what happened. </sentence><sentence id="236">So he put us in another <span class="interior space">room</span>, he closed the <span class="dlf">door</span>, and put a <span class="spatial object">bookcase</span> in front. </sentence><sentence id="237"> Because he was afraid, the German might come back, and sure enough he came. </sentence><sentence id="238">He came looking for us. </sentence><sentence id="239">And he says he never saw us, the <span class="building">building</span> is big, and we might be wandering around in the <span class="building">building</span>. </sentence><sentence id="240">He left, and when it got dark, we came out and went <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="241">And that is how it went on for quite some time. </sentence><sentence id="242">And then they organized us again and they took us to a <span class="building">train station</span> and they had a big <span class="building">barn</span> and we had to stay there for a whole week to work. </sentence><sentence id="243">Men, old men and girls, it doesn't matter what size. </sentence><sentence id="244">And they had a Gentile woman prepare the soup, whatever they gave us, so one day when they served us the food, she said to me, "You know when you finish working here, they are going to blow up the <span class="building">building</span> with you all. </sentence><sentence id="245">I can help you get out if you want. </sentence><sentence id="246">Tell everybody what is happening." </sentence><sentence id="247">So that evening I told them that we had to get out because by tomorrow it might be the end of us. </sentence><sentence id="248">Nobody wanted to listen to me. </sentence><sentence id="249">They all were saying, "Ah, you just think so." </sentence><sentence id="250">Nobody believed that that was going to happen, something. </sentence><sentence id="251">So I told her that I am ready to go. </sentence><sentence id="252">So she brought me a long skirt for summertime, and she bought me a shawl like the people from the farmers wear. </sentence><sentence id="253">And I got dressed, and she got me out of there. </sentence><sentence id="254">And I started walking maybe 30 or 40 kilometers <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="255">Took me a whole day. </sentence><sentence id="256">And when I got to the <span class="building">house</span> and knocked on the <span class="dlf">door</span>, my mother was shocked to see me; because she didn't expect me <span class="building">home</span> yet. </sentence><sentence id="257">She asked me what happened, and I said that is what news we got. </sentence><sentence id="258">And sure enough, they finished working that Friday; and sure enough, that Friday night, that <span class="building">building</span> went off. </sentence><sentence id="259">There is one person also escaped that day before the blow up, and he came <span class="building">home</span> and told what happened. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="355">Q: The rest of them were all killed? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="357">A: The rest of them were killed. </sentence><sentence id="358">You see, before they even sent them to <span class="populated place">camps</span>, they got rid of people, as much as they could. </sentence><sentence id="359">And that went on until 1942. </sentence><sentence id="360">And by that time, everybody got a little smarter and understood what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="361">So everybody made like <span class="building">shelters</span> in the <span class="interior space">basements</span>, wherever they can find a place. </sentence><sentence id="362">Like the <span class="building">house</span> I lived, they made under the <span class="dlf">steps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="363">They made an <span class="dlf">opening</span>. </sentence><sentence id="364">You could not really get in too many people there, you know, just enough to get in. </sentence><sentence id="365">And one morning when we woke up, we saw <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> right in front of the <span class="dlf">gate</span> along the <span class="dlf">street</span>, a lot of Germans, and we understood that something is going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="366">So we crawled into the <span class="building">shelter</span>. </sentence><sentence id="367">And we could hear stomping around in the <span class="building">house</span>, looking, and it was terrible that day. </sentence><sentence id="368">We sit quiet. </sentence><sentence id="369">We didn't have food in there. </sentence><sentence id="370">We didn't expect, you didn't know when they could do it, so you couldn't prepare yourself. </sentence><sentence id="371">So then, after a couple of days sitting in there, the water pipe broke, and the water started coming up, gushing out there, and was almost to our necks, and we had to get out. </sentence><sentence id="372">We couldn't stay no longer. </sentence><sentence id="373">So we came out during the night, went into the <span class="building">house</span>, we changed the clothes. </sentence><sentence id="374">We didn't think about nothing, just to get out. </sentence><sentence id="375">And right across the <span class="dlf">street</span> from the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, there was Gentile people which my mother knew and she secured, we had to run, they will keep us. </sentence><sentence id="376">So we ran from our <span class="building">house</span> to the front <span class="building">house</span> which was closer to the <span class="dlf">road</span>, and we looked around, nobody was there, and we went across the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="377">And my mother knocked on the <span class="dlf">back door</span>, and the man opened the <span class="dlf">door</span> and he said if we not going to leave he is going to call the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="378">He no want to see us and he doesn't know us. </sentence><sentence id="379">So we had no place to go, so next <span class="dlf">door</span> was another Gentile person who knew us. </sentence><sentence id="380">My mother went over there, and he says he can keep us overnight and during the day we will have to leave because it is right by the main <span class="dlf">road</span> and he really don't have a place to keep us. </sentence><sentence id="381">So he had a big stack of hay in the  middle of the <span class="interior space">yard</span>. </sentence><sentence id="382">Anybody could walk over and punch the hay and find us. </sentence><sentence id="383">And we crawled in there. </sentence><sentence id="384">He brought us some food and we sat the next day, all day, and the evening he bought us some clothes so we be looking like Gentile people, and we started walking. </sentence><sentence id="385">Where we were going we didn't know ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="386">My mother had in mind there was a woman living on the outskirts of the <span class="populated place">city</span>, maybe she will keep us. </sentence><sentence id="387">So we walked over to her place, and when we got to her place we heard German voices in the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="388">So we couldn't do nothing, so she had like a little <span class="building">shack</span> which she used to keep a pig in there. </sentence><sentence id="389">We crawled in this little <span class="building">shack</span> and we sat there and waited until the Germans left. </sentence><sentence id="390">When the Germans left, my mother knocked on the <span class="dlf">door</span>, and the woman said she is very sorry, she couldn't keep us. </sentence><sentence id="391">She has no <span class="interior space">room</span> and her daughter is dating those Germans. </sentence><sentence id="392">She says "You can stay tonight if you want, and tomorrow maybe. </sentence><sentence id="393">You have to go." </sentence><sentence id="394">So we stayed overnight and the next morning, early morning, my mother got up, she got dressed, and she left us there, and she went to look for a place. </sentence><sentence id="395">She was gone all day, and in the evening she came, she says, "I find a place." </sentence><sentence id="396">She didn't know the person, the person didn't know her. </sentence><sentence id="397">She was a very nice Gentile woman. </sentence><sentence id="398">She believed in God. </sentence><sentence id="399">She said God sent us to her and she has to do it. </sentence><sentence id="400">She was a poor woman. </sentence><sentence id="401">And we came there, the next morning we came there. </sentence><sentence id="402">And the next morning she put us in the <span class="building">barn</span> at first. </sentence><sentence id="403">She knew that we couldn't stay there because anybody who comes in the <span class="dlf">fields</span> to work, because her husband was a forest man, and everybody had a piece of <span class="env feature">ground</span> and worked in those <span class="dlf">fields</span>. </sentence><sentence id="404">She was afraid anybody come to the <span class="dlf">field</span> would see us. </sentence><sentence id="405">So we were there for awhile and in <span class="country">Europe</span>, they really make a big <span class="dlf">ditch</span>, big <span class="dlf">hole</span>, and they put potatoes and they keep them over winter there. </sentence><sentence id="406">She had potatoes in there. </sentence><sentence id="407">So she took the potatoes out. </sentence><sentence id="408">She put some straw down and she put some <span class="spatial object">boards</span> over top. </sentence><sentence id="409">She put a <span class="dlf">pole</span> in the middle to hold it on and on top, she put in pumpkins, a whole bunch of pumpkins. </sentence><sentence id="410">And she just made a small <span class="dlf">hole</span> so we could climb in there. </sentence><sentence id="411">And we went in there, it was in the fall. </sentence><sentence id="412">We went in there, and we sit there for 16 months in that little <span class="dlf">hole</span>, in that little place. </sentence><sentence id="413">You couldn't even stretch your feet out. </sentence><sentence id="414">And she brought us food once a day. </sentence><sentence id="415">We had one potato, each of us a day, and a quart of water a day. </sentence><sentence id="416">She, herself, didn't have much food. </sentence><sentence id="417">She was glad to feed us with that, and we were happy to get this so long as we are safe. </sentence><sentence id="418">And some days when it was quiet she used to come take the <span class="spatial object">pumpkin</span> away so we can get some air. </sentence><sentence id="419">One day she took the <span class="spatial object">pumpkin</span> away. </sentence><sentence id="420">And we were sitting and talking between each other; and all of a sudden, a <span class="spatial object">car</span> came by and threw the pumpkin on the <span class="dlf">hole</span>. </sentence><sentence id="421">So I said to my father, I said, "Ah, I am going to open up. </sentence><sentence id="422">I will push it." </sentence><sentence id="423">He said, "No, leave it along." </sentence><sentence id="424">And right after that, two Germans passed by. </sentence><sentence id="425">It looked like the <span class="spatial object">car</span> knew...we...that we were there, and she has to save us. </sentence><sentence id="426">And we was there for quite awhile. </sentence><sentence id="427">And the woman knew what was going on, because if they caught people at Gentile's <span class="building">houses</span>, they killed the Gentile and the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="428">She didn't care. </sentence><sentence id="429">She just want to save us. </sentence><sentence id="430">She had one little boy, she had three kids, and one little kid was 4 years old. </sentence><sentence id="431">He used to go in the <span class="dlf">field</span> sometimes and get some carrots out of the <span class="env feature">ground</span> and bring them down to us. </sentence><sentence id="432">He used to say, "The Germans will not live to long enough to kill you." </sentence><sentence id="433">He was very nice, the little kid. </sentence><sentence id="434">And we were there, and then one day, like she noticed it, she thought somebody saw us. </sentence><sentence id="435">It was wintertime. </sentence><sentence id="436">It was cold. </sentence><sentence id="437">She says we have to get out of there. </sentence><sentence id="438">And we went out of there, and we go into the <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="439">On <span class="env feature">ice</span>! </sentence><sentence id="440">We laid on that, and we had hardly any clothes. </sentence><sentence id="441">We laid all night on that <span class="env feature">ice</span>. </sentence><sentence id="442">Everybody, when I tell them, I tell them the story about this <span class="env feature">ice</span>, they don't believe me and I didn't get pneumonia or something. </sentence><sentence id="443">It looks like our bodies were so strong, they took anything. </sentence><sentence id="444">And we stayed  overnight and the next morning, we went back in, and we stayed there until 1944. </sentence><sentence id="445">In 1944, she, herself, used to go to the <span class="populated place">city</span> and bring us newspapers so we could read to her because she couldn't read and write. </sentence><sentence id="446">So in the evenings she used to bring a candle with the paper, and my father used to read the news to her. </sentence><sentence id="447">And we told her if she goes into <span class="populated place">town</span>, see what happens, if she talks to people, tell us what is happening. </sentence><sentence id="448">So in that year of "44, she came back and said the people were talking the Russians were coming back. </sentence><sentence id="449">So it was good news, already the Germans were leaving. </sentence><sentence id="450">So one day she came and she says, "The Germans are out. </sentence><sentence id="451">There was bombing and all that, and the Germans are out, and the Russians are back in." </sentence><sentence id="452">So my parents go out. </sentence><sentence id="453">And they left us still in that <span class="dlf">hole</span> because they were not sure what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="454">They left to <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="455">And we were sitting there; and my sisters were giving me a hard time because they were upset. </sentence><sentence id="456">I was upset myself. </sentence><sentence id="457">And we could do nothing about it. </sentence><sentence id="458">And she didn't know where they were either. </sentence><sentence id="459">So after a couple of days, there was a big snow and they came back. </sentence><sentence id="460">They came back, and they couldn't find us because the snow covered the <span class="env feature">ground</span> so bad. </sentence><sentence id="461">They knew where the place was, it was hard to find the <span class="dlf">opening</span>. </sentence><sentence id="462">And we heard inside that somebody is walking around and like working with something. </sentence><sentence id="463">We were afraid to say anything, because we didn't know really who it was. </sentence><sentence id="464">So at that time I said to my sisters, , "I think maybe they came for us. </sentence><sentence id="465">Just don't cry, don't make noise." </sentence><sentence id="466">And at that time, I heard my mother's voice in Jewish--"Kids, we are here." </sentence><sentence id="467">Oh, when I heard that, I was in <span class="dlf">heaven</span>! </sentence><sentence id="468">And they came with a <span class="spatial object">wagon</span>, with horses, some comforters, down comforters, and clothes for us. </sentence><sentence id="469">They threw down the clothes, and they pulled us out of there. </sentence><sentence id="470">We couldn't even stand up, so weak we were. </sentence><sentence id="471">And the put us right on that <span class="spatial object">wagon</span>. </sentence><sentence id="472">And a doctor, gynecologist, a woman doctor, she took us into her <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="473">And my younger sister could hardly walk at all. </sentence><sentence id="474">Another doctor took her in and kept her for awhile, to put her back on her feet. </sentence><sentence id="475">And we really had a hard time getting back on our feet because whatever food we ate didn't stay with us because we were not used to all that stuff. </sentence><sentence id="476">And there was a lot of nice Gentile people who came and brought us food and brought us everything. </sentence><sentence id="477">And then we started looking around, looked for our own <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="478">Our <span class="building">house</span> was gone. </sentence><sentence id="479">So then we find another empty <span class="building">house</span>, so we moved in there. </sentence><sentence id="480">And we stayed there for awhile. </sentence><sentence id="481">And then, in the fall, my mother adopted a boy who was left alone. </sentence><sentence id="482">The way she adopted him, this gentlemen had him and had another little girl with him. </sentence><sentence id="483">And he came to our <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="484">He knew my parents. </sentence><sentence id="485">He came over and asked we take him in. </sentence><sentence id="486">My mother right away said, "Fine. </sentence><sentence id="487">He is mine." </sentence><sentence id="488">And we had a hard time with him, because he was so used to the Gentile person he didn't really want to stay with us. </sentence><sentence id="489">But after a while he stayed with us. </sentence><sentence id="490">And then from there we left to_6d_, and we were there for awhile. </sentence><sentence id="491">And from there, we went to <span class="country">Germany</span> to a <span class="building">DP camp</span> in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="492">And we were there for awhile, and from there we went to another <span class="populated place">DP camp</span> in <span class="populated place">Eschwege</span>. </sentence><sentence id="493">And from there we left for the <span class="country">United States</span>; in 1949, we came here. </sentence></p></dialogue>
