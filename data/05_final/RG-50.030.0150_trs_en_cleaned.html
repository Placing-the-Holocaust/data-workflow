</sentence><sentence id="948">it was a German doctor that had a  8 whole <span class="env feature">world</span> around us forgot us. </sentence><sentence id="949">I just wanted...to people to know that those people, those girls, those young women that were there were living and breathing one thing. </sentence><sentence id="950">Freedom and survival. </sentence><sentence id="951">Their spirit was so strong. </sentence><sentence id="952">Their bodies were very weak. </sentence><sentence id="953">But there was something in them that just didn't let them die. </sentence><sentence id="954">I have to tell you now about something that happened in <span class="building">Dinnerworker</span> which is really remarkable. </sentence><sentence id="955">We had guards all over. </sentence><sentence id="956">One of the guards was a younger German, and each and every <span class="interior space">room</span> had...had a Jewish woman that was in charge. </sentence><sentence id="957">And in one of the <span class="interior space">rooms</span>...this was <span class="interior space">room number 3</span>....was...in charge was a Mrs. Schwartz. </sentence><sentence id="958">She was little older than us because she was married at this time already. </sentence><sentence id="959">She was not a beauty, but a very clever woman. </sentence><sentence id="960">And somehow, I don't know how, this young German guard fell in love. </sentence><sentence id="961">And every night, they used to talk for hours and hours. </sentence><sentence id="962">And we couldn't understand this what he saw in her,

id="965">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="966">And one day came and there were <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> standing in front of our...the <span class="building">building</span> that we were kept, and they said they...they need women to...uh...<span class="populated place">labor camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="967">It was called __, and they working something with electric...electricity...electric lamps, something. </sentence><sentence id="968">And between those that were taken was also Mrs. Schwartz. </sentence><sentence id="969">Mrs...of course, this guard was beside himself, and he went right with there, with her. </sentence><sentence id="970">Not officially, but he went as a guard with them. </sentence><sentence id="971">When...we were told. </sentence><sentence id="972">I wasn't...I didn't see it, but I was told that when they came there, there was a selection and since Mrs.Schwartz was a little older, she was taken in a <span class="spatial object">truck</span> and this man...this guard knew that she was taken to be shot. </sentence><sentence id="973">When he saw her being taken away, he shot himself. </sentence><sentence id="974">So this was one the remarkable story. </sentence><sentence id="975">We stayed in <span class="building">Dinnerworker</span> til one day...one day I think it was already in 1944, they told...they all loaded us into a big <span class="spatial object">boat</span>, and they took us across the <span class="env feature">Baltic Sea</span>. </sentence><sentence id="976">It was near <span

id="977">After a voyage of 3 or 4 days on the big <span class="spatial object">boat</span>, on the big...uh..<span class="spatial object">boat</span>, we were taken with barrages to a different <span

id="982">The food in the morning they used to give us a slice of black bread and a little bit hot water, black. </sentence><sentence id="983">Since we didn't have water to wash our head, we used this...this water to wash our hair. </sentence><sentence id="984">Uh...During they day they used...they used to bring a very big <span class="spatial object">pot</span>, tremendous pot like the pot sometimes you used the pet. </sentence><sentence id="985">You used the pet and to wash to do their wash them in the...and it was full with black water, many times cold with turnips half cooked. </sentence><sentence id="986">And they...this was our...this was what they will give us to eat, and after they finished the...the women guards would finish to distribute this meager rations. </sentence><sentence id="987">Since we were so hungry, we used to crawl with the head to...to scrap some food on the bottom, and the German used to stand and laugh. </sentence><sentence id="988">We were surrounded with...uh...<span class="dlf">electric wire</span> and with so many men and women just fall on the <span class="dlf">electric wires</span>. </sentence><sentence id="989">I saw it. </sentence><sentence id="990">They committed suicide. </sentence><sentence id="991">Men they separated from you. </sentence><sentence id="992">We saw there Hungarian women. </sentence><sentence id="993">We saw there that were brought because it was already 44, we saw the...we saw the...we saw all kinds of nationalities...Jewish nationalities. </sentence><sentence id="994">And those German guards were so bad, so sadistic, so cruel that I just don't have the words to describe. </sentence><sentence id="995">One day they called us out...they put us...it was cold...in appell. </sentence><sentence id="996">We had to stand up, and they said that young women will be taken to a <span class="populated place">labor camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="997">My sister then was...was in big danger, and when she passed near the German, he asked her...] told her to stand with herself out and show that she had a big bust, and I put some...something into her breast. </sentence><sentence id="998">And  9 "How old you are?" </sentence><sentence id="999">And she said, "I am 18." </sentence><sentence id="1000">Uh...He...he...she went through, but it was such a traumatic experience for me that I cannot...because my mind already said goodbye to her. </sentence><sentence id="1001">And also the first time in <span class="populated place">Stutthof</span>, I saw those stripes because those striped uniform and we very anxious to get them because we were very cold. </sentence><sentence id="1002">We didn't...we had very thin dresses. </sentence><sentence id="1003">We didn't have shoes. </sentence><sentence id="1004">My legs were frostbitten, and those uniforms were kind...but they...they didn't give us at this time. </sentence><sentence id="1005">And really at the strangest sound they would help us to fight the cold. </sentence><sentence id="1006">Very shortly, after we left <span class="populated place">Stutthof</span>, a big epidemic of typhus broke out there. </sentence><sentence id="1007">My aunt and my cousin died right there in the epidemic. </sentence><sentence id="1008">My cousin-in-law survived this...this epidemic, and I met her after the libera...liberation, but just the moment when I was separated from my aunt from there, it was a...took so much of the spirits because they...my...my...they didn't want to go because my aunt...then she was in her 40s looked older. </sentence><sentence id="1009">They knew that she will not accept it, and she didn't go. </sentence><sentence id="1010">Finally, we were brought to <span class="populated place">Stuttgart labor camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1011">Oh, it was...<span class="populated place">Stutthof labor camp</span> was a <span class="populated place">camp</span>...a <span class="populated place">camp</span> that we really worked very, very hard because facilities were miserable. </sentence><sentence id="1012">We didn't have the proper

and when we came <span class="building">home</span> we were so tired that we couldn't even eat. </sentence><sentence id="1026">We were just over exhausted. </sentence><sentence id="1027">We were just happy that you could lie down and stretch out. </sentence><sentence id="1028">I didn't go to the --T didn't do nothins. </sentence><sentence id="1029">The next <span class="dlf">dav</span> in <span
