<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4">Q: And your name was Per Anger then? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="7">Per Anger, I got other names, which I had never mentioned, because that was my mother wanted that I should have named after our old relatives. </sentence><sentence id="8">So my name is Per Johann Valentine (ph).I never mentioned those other names because I don't think they are very pretty. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="13">Q: Do you ever use them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="15">A: No, no. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="17">Q: Mr. Anger, in 1941, you were sent to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="18">You were a member of the <span class="building">foreign service</span> at this point. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="21">A: 1940. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="23">Q: 1940. </sentence><sentence id="24">Can you tell us what that was like? </sentence><sentence id="25">You were a very young man. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="29">A: This was my first post. </sentence><sentence id="30">I had applied -- see, I had applied for the foreign service already earlier, but I wasn't ready with my exam. </sentence><sentence id="31">And at <span class="populated place">Uppsala</span>, I studied law, and in the meantime I was drafted; I was in the military service. </sentence><sentence id="32">So I had difficulty in finishing this, but I just finished in time in December 1939, when the war broke out between <span class="country">Finland</span> and the Soviets at that time. </sentence><sentence id="33">A dramatic period. </sentence><sentence id="34">And the war had already started. </sentence><sentence id="35">And the beginning of World War II had already started, of course. </sentence><sentence id="36">So the <span class="building">Swedish Foreign Office</span> knowing that I was applying for entering the service, they said, "Look, here. </sentence><sentence id="37">We have -- we need staff now. </sentence><sentence id="38">So we could present you as a trainee to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> in January." </sentence><sentence id="39">And so I just got out of the military service, and I just happened to finish my law exam. </sentence><sentence id="40">So I was sent in January 1940 to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> to help at the <span class="building">commercial department</span> in the <span class="building">Swedish Embassy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="41">So I was working there the whole spring and went <span class="building">home</span> then in June, the same year, to apply and to go through the exam for the foreign service. </sentence><sentence id="42">And I managed to get through that and returned then to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> where I stayed on till summer "41. </sentence><sentence id="43">And I returned to <span class="populated place">Stockholm</span> exactly the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="44">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="45"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection day when <span class="country">Germany</span> invaded, so in June, midsummer "41. </sentence><sentence id="46">So from there on, I stayed on another year in <span class="populated place">Stockholm</span>. </sentence><sentence id="47">But in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, it was, of course, for me, for a Swede never having been out in war and all that, it was quite a new situation, all that. </sentence><sentence id="48">And it wasn't so much all of the bombing and fighting, that didn't happen then because all over Europe was then slowly being dominated by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="49">Not during the spring, but as you remember, in April they invaded <span class="country">Norway</span>, <span class="country">Denmark</span> in a big operation when they took over all of Europe. </sentence><sentence id="50">So during this first half-year when I was there, it was very, very little of wars, things which reminds me of the war. </sentence><sentence id="51">There were some <span class="spatial object">British airplanes</span> coming in now and then and dropped some bombs on <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="52">And so we had to go around in the <span class="building">shelters</span> and so on. </sentence><sentence id="53">But it was, of course, hard to get food and it was also a very severe winter that 1940 and so on. </sentence><sentence id="54">So it was in a way then kind of a hardship for all the people in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, all of them. </sentence><sentence id="55">But it was not destroyed and not -- those bombs didn't cause very much damage really. </sentence><sentence id="56">But it was a psychological thing, which is very interesting. </sentence><sentence id="57">There came one <span class="spatial object">British airplane</span> in during the night, say, at midnight and forced the whole population down in the <span class="building">shelters</span>. </sentence><sentence id="58">And then Hitler was, of course, furious that the <span class="building">Air Force</span> couldn't stop these people coming in. </sentence><sentence id="59">And so everybody was sitting there in the <span class="building">shelters</span>. </sentence><sentence id="60">And then after an hour, they went up again to continue to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="61">And then after two more hours, another <span class="spatial object">airplane</span> came from <span class="country">Britain</span> and started to drop some bombs and forced the whole population again down in the <span class="building">shelters</span>. </sentence><sentence id="62">So that was a kind of psychological warfare, in a way, which was very frustrating for the people in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="63">Then they started to know that now something is coming here, and this is only the beginning, which was the fact. </sentence><sentence id="64">But then, you see, slowly the Germans took over, and I was there -- I was there in April when we sent the first -- I think it was end of March, we sent the first dispatch or the code telegram to <span class="country">Sweden</span> about the German planning. </sentence><sentence id="65">That was very -- I was there sitting in my <span class="interior space">room</span> on a Sunday when they telephoned from the <span class="building">embassy</span>. " </sentence><sentence id="66">Now, you have to come here because you are on duty, and you have to send a code telegram to <span class="country">Sweden</span>, a cipher." </sentence><sentence id="67">So I came there and I remember still that was one of the more dramatic periods of my life at that time. </sentence><sentence id="68">I was waiting for that telegram to come, and my boss said, "Now, in a few minutes you will get the most terrible message you ever have met to send to <span class="country">Sweden</span>." </sentence><sentence id="69">And that was the information we had got through the <span class="interior space">underground</span>, and  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Kanaris (ph) and those people in <span class="country">Germany</span> who were working against Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="70">And we got through them the whole plan that in a few days, they are going to invade <span class="country">Denmark</span>, <span class="country">Norway</span> -- we didn't know about <span class="country">Sweden</span>, if they were going to touch <span class="country">Sweden</span>. </sentence><sentence id="71">And that's part of a bigger plan to conquer the whole of <span class="region">Europe</span>, including <span class="country">Britain</span>, which they never succeeded. </sentence><sentence id="72">But the whole of <span class="country">France</span>, <span class="country">Belgium</span>, <span class="country">Poland</span> and so on. </sentence><sentence id="73">So I got that in, and I started to put it into this <span class="spatial object">mapping machine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="74">It was at that time a very awkward <span class="spatial object">machine</span>, a modern thing. </sentence><sentence id="75">And I managed to get it through and I went to the <span class="building">post office</span> and mailed that to <span class="populated place">Stockholm</span>, and then I couldn't sleep, of course. </sentence><sentence id="76">My god, perhaps I had made the wrong sort of -- pushed the wrong button or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="77">So what happens -- what could happen now in <span class="populated place">Stockholm</span> is that the Germans will invade <span class="country">Sweden</span> tomorrow; and they will not be warned in <span class="country">Sweden</span> because there was a sloppy sort of attache at the <span class="building">embassy</span> who couldn't cipher, who couldn't send the right telegram to <span class="country">Sweden</span>. </sentence><sentence id="78">That will be you can read it in all the history books about this man. </sentence><sentence id="79">It was a nightmare I had. </sentence><sentence id="80">And, of course, they could, and that is the interesting reaction then in <span class="country">Sweden</span> -- "We think you have been nervous in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="81">I mean, we can't understand why you sort of exaggerate things like that." </sentence><sentence id="82">And they didn't believe us. </sentence><sentence id="83">And then, not till a couple of days before, I would say five days before the invasion, we send a new cable. </sentence><sentence id="84">And then they understood that now, it's serious. </sentence><sentence id="85">Now, it's serious, but that was rather later. </sentence><sentence id="86">You know, we were not prepared at all to defend our <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="87">And Hitler apparently thought that it wasn't necessary to invade <span class="country">Sweden</span> because he could always do that later on. </sentence><sentence id="88"><span class="country">Sweden</span> was always there, and we were delivering iron ore to him. </sentence><sentence id="89">And he was happy with that, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="90">So granted, they conquered <span class="country">Norway</span>, <span class="country">Denmark</span>, and the other <span class="country">countries</span>. </sentence><sentence id="91">So I was then in that situation. </sentence><sentence id="92">Then, we were in administration, we were sitting in the <span class="building">embassy</span> and didn't know from one day or the other if the Germans were going to include <span class="country">Sweden</span> also in the attack towards <span class="region">Scandinavia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="93">And then I also remember another episode which I very much remember is when the brigade or the army, whatever you call it, returned from <span class="country">France</span> marching through the <span class="dlf">streets</span> of <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> and how the people greeted them and throwing flowers towards the soldiers and thinking that now, the war is over. </sentence><sentence id="94">And the war had just started, you know, which they couldn't understand that. </sentence><sentence id="95">The war had just started. </sentence><sentence id="96">And they marched, these troops marched up and lined up outside the big <span class="building">palace</span>. </sentence><sentence id="97">The This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="98">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="99"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection <span class="building">Villa Platt</span> (ph) was the name, and out on the <span class="interior space">balcony</span> came Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="100">And he was greeted then by the masses saying "Heil, Hitler" and all of that. </sentence><sentence id="101">I was standing there and everybody did this, that salute, so I thought I better do that. </sentence><sentence id="102">Otherwise, I don't -- but I had forgotten one thing. </sentence><sentence id="103">I had still my hat on, and then a man right behind me gave me a blow like that so my hat flew away, I don't how long, because you shouldn't stand facing the Fihrer with a hat on. </sentence><sentence id="104">So that was that atmosphere, you know, of sort of he had more or less hypnotized the whole population. </sentence><sentence id="105">He was the -- I mean, the savior, the Fiihrer and all that. </sentence><sentence id="106">So that gave me the first impression; I saw how terribly this system had infiltrated in the whole population. </sentence><sentence id="107">And then after that came also the persecutions of the -- the Jewish persecutions and all that and so on. </sentence><sentence id="108">One didn't notice so much of it in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> because they did it in a very clever, secret way. </sentence><sentence id="109">But I remember that I had a housekeeper, a Jewish lady, who came to -- I was a bachelor at the time -- to clean up my <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="110">All of a sudden, or one day, she didn't come. </sentence><sentence id="111">She just disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="112">So they disappeared, just like that, and were brought to the <span class="populated place">extermination camps</span> or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="113">Only at that time, it wasn't very much known in the world, I would say. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="202">Q: Were you getting reports about what was happening in <span class="country">Germany</span> and then what was happening outside in terms of the persecution . . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="204">A: Ya. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="206">Q: . .. </sentence><sentence id="207">not just the war? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="210">A: Yes, we didn't very much, say, in 1940. </sentence><sentence id="211">We didn't know very about it then -- or "41, I didn't know other than there was discriminations against the Jewish people and so on. </sentence><sentence id="212">But the first real report we sent -- I wasn't there then, I was then in <span class="populated place">Budapest</span> -- was sent in "42. </sentence><sentence id="213">You see, there was the big conference in <span class="populated place">Wannsee</span> in the beginning of "42, when the final solution was decided upon. </sentence><sentence id="214">And then towards the end of that year, the world started to know about it. </sentence><sentence id="215">I know that the Americans knew about it; also, the Swedish. </sentence><sentence id="216">The American government knew about it, the Swedish government and all that; because we had a diplomat at the <span class="building">Berlin Embassy</span>, a good friend of mine, who on a <span class="spatial object">train</span> in, say, October "42 met an SS officer who came up and said, "I have to tell you. </sentence><sentence id="217">I can't stand it any longer." </sentence><sentence id="218">And he told him the whole story about the <span class="interior space">gas chambers</span>. </sentence><sentence id="219">And that we This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="220">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="221"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection reported <span class="building">home</span> to <span class="country">Sweden</span> in "42. </sentence><sentence id="222">So, for sure, from the autumn of "42, the Swedish government and the Americans got the same report, and the Swiss and all. </sentence><sentence id="223">From that on, most of the governments in the <span class="region">western world</span> knew what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="224">I think that is important to say because to -- knowing how little they did, or they did nothing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="241">Q: Did you know about the euthanasia killings in <span class="country">Germany</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="243">A: About the what? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="245">Q: About the euthanasia, when they were doing so-called mercy killings in <span class="country">Germany</span> in the <span class="building">hospitals</span>, in the <span class="building">mental hospitals</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="247">A: I didn't know at that time. </sentence><sentence id="248">I think we got to know about that later. </sentence><sentence id="249">I didn't know anything then at that time, no. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="253">Q: When you said you were in this situation watching the Fiihrer and watching everybody respond to him and you almost raised your hand in a "Heil, Hitler," but, fortunately, you were stopped, what were you thinking? </sentence><sentence id="254">Were you frightened and thought you would have to do it because somebody . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="257">A: Why, they would have killed me. </sentence><sentence id="258">Oh absolutely. </sentence><sentence id="259">There saying such -- what do I say -- excited, what you call, hypnotical (sic) situation. </sentence><sentence id="260">They were spellbound. </sentence><sentence id="261">They were spellbound by this man. </sentence><sentence id="262">So if you said anything against him or if you did anything to him, you would have been killed on the spot by the mass of people, by the crowd. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="269">Q: When you met ordinary Germans during this period, did they -- were they hypnotized even outside of that situation when there were crowds? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="271">A: Well, they -- not hypnotized, but they were all indoctrinated in a fantastic way. </sentence><sentence id="272">I mean, this Goebbels must have been absolute, remarkable professional in the way of spreading this information or indoctrinating people. </sentence><sentence id="273">Imagine, at that time there was no <span class="spatial object">television</span>. </sentence><sentence id="274">There was just the spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="275">There was the <span class="spatial object">radio</span>, of course, and the <span class="spatial object">newspapers</span>, but that was enough. </sentence><sentence id="276">I was living at that time at the <span class="building">pension</span>, where I was sitting around the <span class="spatial object">table</span> with the Germans and old people and how the day after the invasion of <span class="country">Norway</span> and <span class="country">Denmark</span> were so happy. </sentence><sentence id="277">They said, "Look, aren't you happy?" </sentence><sentence id="278">Looked at me, "Why?" " </sentence><sentence id="279">Because we have saved, we have saved your This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="280">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="281"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection neighbors from being invaded by the allies, by the British. </sentence><sentence id="282">And now, they are going to be free people, and, of course, under our control. </sentence><sentence id="283">Anyhow, we have saved them from this imperialist sort of western powers." </sentence><sentence id="284">This whole attitude was so all over. </sentence><sentence id="285">There were no exceptions from that theory. </sentence><sentence id="286">And, of course, it was part of it and so forth that they were also perhaps -- even if they thought that it was absolutely the wrong, the right version of it, they were scared to say something against it. </sentence><sentence id="287">Because then they knew what was going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="288">So everybody was -- I mean, even the officials in the <span class="building">foreign service</span> with whom I had to deal, they were all the same. </sentence><sentence id="289">They never doubted. </sentence><sentence id="290">When you came up to the <span class="building">foreign office</span>, I was dealing with the commercial things, always the same salute. " </sentence><sentence id="291">Heil, Hitler," like that, you know. </sentence><sentence id="292">I never said, "Heil, Hitler." </sentence><sentence id="293">Never in my life. </sentence><sentence id="294">So that was the way of greeting people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="320">Q: What sort of an impression -- you were a very young person and certainly had not experienced this kind of form of government, this kind of oppression. </sentence><sentence id="321">What effect did this have on you in your mid 20s, late 20s? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="324">A: Well, that's -- of course, it was very strange for me to encounter such a system. </sentence><sentence id="325">Of course, it was, but that is also very dangerous because without knowing if yourself, you get indoctrinated. </sentence><sentence id="326">If you every day hear the same thing in radio, read the same thing in the paper, hearing people speaking about the same thing, about how victorious we are and how we are going to conquer the whole world, and all that and so on, and Hitler is a fantastic man. </sentence><sentence id="327">He has given us jobs and all that and so on. </sentence><sentence id="328">So I sometimes had the impression that I have to go to <span class="country">Sweden</span> now for some vacation to breathe, to listen to other opinions than this. </sentence><sentence id="329">I mean, this is remarkable how you can get influenced without knowing it yourself. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="336">Q: Did you see any persecution of anybody? </sentence><sentence id="337">Beatings in the <span class="dlf">street</span> or... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="340">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="342">Q: Nothing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="344">A: No, I didn't see anything like that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="346">Q: How did it happen that you were sent to <span class="populated place">Budapest</span> in 1942? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="348">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="349">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="350"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="351">A: Well, it so happened because I was then off to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> dealing with the Hungarian affairs in the <span class="building">foreign office</span> with the commercial matters, and there were delegations from <span class="populated place">Budapest</span> coming. </sentence><sentence id="352">And we were negotiating with them, and we saw that <span class="country">Hungary</span> is a potential sort of delivery of our goods we need. </sentence><sentence id="353">Foodstuffs, and all that. </sentence><sentence id="354"><span class="country">Hungary</span> was and still is an <span class="region">agricultural country</span>, you know, so then they wanted to send someone who already got some experience in these negotiations. </sentence><sentence id="355">So I was sent to <span class="populated place">Budapest</span> mainly because they needed someone for this job. </sentence><sentence id="356">So I was participating in the negotiations there. </sentence><sentence id="357">The Swedish delegation coming out, I was a member of that. </sentence><sentence id="358">And we tried to -- you know, that old system of negotiations about trade that if we give you some steel, you give us some apples. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="367">Q: Bartering? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1753">A: Well, the bombings of the allies, the air force and all that was going more sporadically to start with, but it was then concentrated very much towards the end. </sentence><sentence id="1754">And then when the Russians were surrounding the <span class="populated place">city</span>, they were shooting artillery into the <span class="populated place">city</span> and all that. </sentence><sentence id="1755">And the worst -- absolutely the worst situation was, of course, when they took to the <span class="region">Pest side</span> first, and we were then separated from Raoul Wallenberg. </sentence><sentence id="1756">He happened to be on that side when they came, and we were on the other. </sentence><sentence id="1757">We never knew, you know, where the Russians were coming first. </sentence><sentence id="1758">It looked as though they were going into <span class="populated place">Budapest</span>, the <span class="region">Buda side</span>, they were first. </sentence><sentence id="1759">Because they came to surroundings of <span class="populated place">Budapest</span>, which stopped the Nazis for a while to persecute us who were on that side. </sentence><sentence id="1760">On the <span class="region">Pest side</span>, nothing had happened, but always it was kind of surprise they attacked Pest first in the beginning of January and went through the underground to <span class="interior space">cellars</span> and <span class="interior space">caves</span> and come in the back of the Germans and all that, and the Germans then panicked, tore for the <span class="dlf">bridges</span> and tried to get over to <span class="populated place">Buda</span> where they were sitting. </sentence><sentence id="1761">And that remains then in the German hands another month till they then attacked us. </sentence><sentence id="1762">But during that time, it was the most terrible time from the viewpoint of the war because then the Soviets put on their artillery on the Pest and shooting direct fire up on us and destroying the whole <span class="populated place">Buda</span>, the <span class="building">royal palace</span> and all the other <span class="building">houses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1763">And we were sitting -- if you stay first in the first war, you move down and you ended up down in the <span class="interior space">caves</span> where we were spending our last time. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1974">A: Oh, no. </sentence><sentence id="1975">Oh, no. </sentence><sentence id="1976">So that is when I said to Raoul, "Now, you have really -- now, you have done the job here. </sentence><sentence id="1977">Now, you have to think of your own safety absolutely because the whole situation is completely hopeless as chaotic and all that," and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1978">And that is when he says, "But you see, I can't stop now any longer because I can never return to <span class="country">Sweden</span> without knowing that I've done as This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1979">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1980"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 1 much as I can to save as many people as possible." </sentence><sentence id="1981">That is his last word to me, the 10th of January. </sentence><sentence id="1982">Then he returns to <span class="populated place">Pest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1983">The Germans withdraw, blew up the <span class="dlf">bridges</span>, and Raoul is arrested by the Soviet troops. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2007">Q: What did this entail? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2009">A: Well, you see, this also I think contributed to the suspicions, the Russians! </sentence><sentence id="2010">suspicions because he very proudly he told them the story about the future here now will be that I, Swedish diplomat and all that, I am going to stay on and I am going to reorganize this humanitarian action. </sentence><sentence id="2011">I'm going to see to it that the family will be reunited. </sentence><sentence id="2012">That the <span class="dlf">property</span> is put back to the Jewish people, and all that and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2013">And some author has said that he was politically naive. </sentence><sentence id="2014">And my answer to that is weren't we all very naive, the whole <span class="region">western world</span>? </sentence><sentence id="2015">I mean, we accepted the Soviets because they helped to defeat the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="2016">And when I came <span class="building">home</span> to <span class="country">Sweden</span>, when I told the people that I'm completely convinced that the Soviets had arrested Raoul, that how could you say things like that about the Soviets, our great helper? </sentence><sentence id="2017">They have helped us to defeat the Nazis, the Nazi system and all that and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2018">And the whole <span class="region">western world</span> said the same thing till 1948, at least, until <span class="populated place">Prague</span> situation then. </sentence><sentence id="2019">So we all thought -- we thought ourselves as soon as the Soviets arrive, we will reestablish our <span class="building">embassy</span> here. </sentence><sentence id="2020">We will continue our work. </sentence><sentence id="2021">Never happened. </sentence><sentence id="2022">They didn't want any foreigners to remain on the <span class="region">territory</span> which they were going to occupy. </sentence><sentence id="2023">So all the <span class="building">embassies</span> were taken away like that. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2061">Q: Were things like this done once a day, more than that when he would go out? </sentence><sentence id="2062">I mean, what kind of situation are we talking about when we talk about not simply saving people by giving them the passes which are obviously very significant, but also going out and doing something, which was what was unusual, when you and he went out or he went out? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2065">A: Well, it was all certainly a combination of all this that he -- first, we had the protective passports. </sentence><sentence id="2066">The people lodged in our <span class="building">houses</span>, that's one thing. </sentence><sentence id="2067">But once that was done, it was the question to try to save more people than that. </sentence><sentence id="2068">And also to find if by chance some people without a passport had been deported or were on the way to be deported, you see. </sentence><sentence id="2069">So that became a routine in a way to check on that when the <span class="spatial object">trains</span> were leaving for <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> or the death marches later on, of course. </sentence><sentence id="2070">So that was complementary to this first more or less organized sanction by the government and all that; that was one thing. </sentence><sentence id="2071">The other thing was to try to -- I had hoped to help people who were on the way to be deported and then comes, of course, the big risky operation which Raoul Wallenberg didn't form himself, but indirectly through his presence. </sentence><sentence id="2072">You see, it's also interesting with Raoul Wallenberg which is very well described by Levi in the first book which appeared just after the war. </sentence><sentence id="2073">He says something like that Raoul Wallenberg became the observing eye, so to say, which -- the conscience. </sentence><sentence id="2074">He became kind of a something which the Nazis feared in a way that his mere presence stopped them from going still further in a way sometimes. </sentence><sentence id="2075">And an example of that is, of course, that when one of the collaborators, I don't think that Raoul Wallenberg was present himself, heard that the Hungarian officers were going to blow up the whole, so to say, international -- our <span class="building">houses</span> in This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="2076">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="2077"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 3 their desperation because they couldn't deport any people any longer because, you see, they were just being encircled by the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="2078">Then he took upon him to say in Raoul's words that Raoul Wallenberg is sending a message to you, General Schmitthuber (ph), who was the last remaining army general. </sentence><sentence id="2079">I mean, not SS, but the army general in <span class="populated place">Budapest</span>.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2334">Q: You, in an interview at <span class="populated place">Uppsala</span>, commented on a question that a filmmaker had asked you that had one of you returned from <span class="populated place">Budapest</span>, not just Raoul Wallenberg, what do you think would have been the feelings, the understandings of what everybody did? </sentence><sentence id="2335">I think the question has something to do with when one person is taken and other people who have also done many things came back, does that enlarge the reputation of Raoul Wallenberg, because he was the one who obviously suffered after the war in a way that the rest of you didn't. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2338">A: Well, I think that the mere fact that we all stood up behind Raoul Wallenberg, and even if we were not -- every person were not engaged 100 percent like Raoul Wallenberg in saving people like that, at least at the beginning we had so many other things to do, and we were working day and night, especially before he came, of course. </sentence><sentence id="2339">But after he came, for me, the main task was to keep this together. </sentence><sentence id="2340">I mean, it could have easily ended up in a big catastrophe if he made mistakes which would have, after all, frustrated the Germans that much that they would stopped everything, you see. </sentence><sentence id="2341">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="2342">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="2343"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 9 So there was a balance the whole time, and I think because that we had this big organization, because we had an <span class="building">embassy</span> with a reputation of being correct and that and having the relations with <span class="country">Germany</span> and all that, Raoul Wallenberg with all what he did and so on, he could never have acted on his own alone, never. </sentence><sentence id="2344">So even if he and every person didn't do the same job as he did, the mere fact that he was there, that the <span class="building">embassy</span> was there, that was the whole base for his action, you see. </sentence><sentence id="2345">So we both helped each other in one way or another as much as we could. </sentence><sentence id="2346">So, I mean, did the question you asked was -- I don't. . . </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2362">Because alone Raoul Wallenberg could not have possibly have done what he did, right? </sentence><sentence id="2363">So I think his question to you has to do with the reasons why the reputation is so much larger than other people's. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2364">A: Ya. </sentence><sentence id="2365">Well, I think I understand what you mean. </sentence><sentence id="2366">And, of course, suppose that nobody had come back. </sentence><sentence id="2367">Of course, still Raoul Wallenberg would have got most of the credit. </sentence><sentence id="2368">Of course, he did the job more than we did, but I think that we would have been recognized also for being his supporters and the base for his action. </sentence><sentence id="2369">I think especially in the perspective perhaps not the first day after the discovery, but in a perspective now with all historians looking to this, I think they would have today to say that today we would still be there somewhere or killed or died. </sentence><sentence id="2370">Today, they would have analyzed the situation, and they would have come to this conclusion, as I told you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
