<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: My name is Eve Rich. </sentence><sentence id="6">My maiden name was Wagszul. </sentence><sentence id="7">I was born in <span class="populated place">Kowel</span>, spelled K - O-W-E-Lon the <span class="dlf">Russian border</span>, very close to the <span class="dlf">Russian border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="8">My childhood as I remember was very nice. </sentence><sentence id="9">My father was a very, very religious man, came from a poor family but they were all educated. </sentence><sentence id="10">They were rabbis, schokhets (ritual slaughterers) and scholars. </sentence><sentence id="11">My mother was not an educated woman. </sentence><sentence id="12">She came from a family from a <span class="populated place">village</span> not too far from <span class="populated place">Kowel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="13">Her father, my grandfather, was a very clever man. </sentence><sentence id="14">As a Jew he could never own any <span class="region">land</span>, but because he was a very good businessman, he leased <span class="env feature">forests</span> and then they would cut them up for lumber. </sentence><sentence id="15">And he was quite successful, so my mom's family was comfortable. </sentence><sentence id="16">I wouldn't say rich because it would mean a lot, but they were very comfortable, so they insisted that the children, us, that we all went to <span class="building">private schools</span>. </sentence><sentence id="17">They made sure that we didn't have any accents, that we didn't speak Jewish at <span class="building">home</span>, because if you had an accent you couldn't get into a good <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="18">This sometimes did not go over too well with my dad because he was religious, but he could see with anti-Semitism in <span class="country">Poland</span> that it might be to our benefits. </sentence><sentence id="19">I was the youngest of two sisters and a brother. </sentence><sentence id="20">My brother left for <span class="country">Israel</span> right after his bar mitzvah and I barely remembered it. </sentence><sentence id="21">I was very little. </sentence><sentence id="22">I think I was like five years old. </sentence><sentence id="23">And pretty soon after enjoying a good childhood with even help in the <span class="building">house</span>...you know, we always had a maid, a woman. </sentence><sentence id="24">Her name was Katja. </sentence><sentence id="25">I can still remember. </sentence><sentence id="26">and my dad I must say was a lawyer but because he could, as a Jew he couldn't pass the <span class="building">Polish bar</span> 01:03: he became an advocate for the Polish lawyers. </sentence><sentence id="27">It means he would hang around the <span class="building">Polish court</span>, give them advice, but he could never enter, could never be in front of the judge. </sentence><sentence id="28">But he had plenty of business within the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span>...fourteen thousand Jews. </sentence><sentence id="29">And we were pretty comfortable. </sentence><sentence id="30">We had everything. </sentence><sentence id="31">We had a nice <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="32">my grandfather bought us a <span class="spatial object">piano</span>. </sentence><sentence id="33">One of my sisters... my mom played the <span class="spatial object">piano</span>. </sentence><sentence id="34">One of my sisters played the <span class="spatial object">piano</span>. </sentence><sentence id="35">You know, I was never much...I played but I wasn't as talented as my sister, and then the Russians came into <span class="populated place">town</span> and of course things changed and I don't remember much because things didn't change for us economically, you know. </sentence><sentence id="36">My father was very smart. </sentence><sentence id="37">He was afraid that the Russians knowingly would send us probably to <span class="region">Siberia</span> because everybody in <span class="populated place">town</span> knew that we were Zionists, especially my father. </sentence><sentence id="38">But little did we knew that the Russians started to move back because the Germans came in, and this is when my tragedy started. </sentence><sentence id="39">We were put in a <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> where life was pretty pretty horrible and soon after they divided like the <span class="populated place">old town</span> and the <span class="populated place">new town</span> and for some reason we ended up in the <span class="populated place">old town</span> because my father wanted to be with his mother, with my grandmother and when the first order was to get the Jews out of <span class="populated place">town</span>, they didn't tell us they were going to kill them. </sentence><sentence id="40">They told us they were going to  take the men to <span class="populated place">labor camps</span> and the women were going to go to a different <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="78">Q: What was the life like in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="80">A: It was bad. </sentence><sentence id="81">There wasn't enough food but I remember because of my grandfather's connection, because he lived in a <span class="populated place">village</span>, you know, and a lot of people worked for him, he would constantly send a non-Jewish peasant over with food, but there came a time where they wouldn't let him through the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and we were practically starved and there were no facilities to wash, you know. </sentence><sentence id="82">Sometimes they would cut off the <span class="env feature">water</span>. </sentence><sentence id="83">Things were pretty bad. </sentence><sentence id="84">01:06: A lot of people, the older people started to die because there was no doctors around. </sentence><sentence id="85">The doctors were taken to the <span class="populated place">camps</span> earlier and we knew that sooner or later they're going to either kill us or take us to <span class="populated place">labor camps</span>, the younger people, and that one night that I remember so well, we were told to leave the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="86">For some reason my father wouldn't leave the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="87">I don't remember why I was in the <span class="building">house</span>, because my mother and my sisters were not and they came in. </sentence><sentence id="88">They broke down the <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="89">The <span class="dlf">doors</span> were locked. </sentence><sentence id="90">They came in. </sentence><sentence id="91">My father had a <span class="spatial object">talis</span> (<span class="spatial object">prayershawl</span>) on. </sentence><sentence id="92">He prayed. </sentence><sentence id="93">And they killed him in front of my eyes. </sentence><sentence id="94">I really don't remember what went what went through my mind. </sentence><sentence id="95">I didn't cry. </sentence><sentence id="96">I didn't scream. </sentence><sentence id="97">I just ran around the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> and I got outside. </sentence><sentence id="98">Outside there were people running and there were several of us young girls and some of the German soldiers that surrounded the <span class="populated place">ghettos</span> let us go through and I remember one of them gave us a battery, light. </sentence><sentence id="99">I don't know...maybe he meant for us just to run. </sentence><sentence id="100">It was dark and to try to save ourselves and this was like the first time that I realized 01:08: that maybe not all of them are bad, because he he could have killed us. </sentence><sentence id="101">I think there were three or four of us. </sentence><sentence id="102">When I think of that moment I can't understand that I didn't take time to make sure that my father is indeed dead. </sentence><sentence id="103">They could have shot him and he could have been alive and suffering. </sentence><sentence id="104">I just cannot explain that and I have a lot of guilt about it and to this day I think about it and the only explanation that I could give you and I have given maybe to myself is that the will of surviving was so strong that I couldn't think of him. </sentence><sentence id="105">I wanted to live for a better world or to tell the story. </sentence><sentence id="106">I was always afraid that all the suffering would be forgotten and there's nobody going to be there to tell the story, and I started to run. </sentence><sentence id="107">I ran through <span class="populated place">villages</span>. </sentence><sentence id="108">The <span class="env feature">forest</span> was our <span class="building">home</span> at night. </sentence><sentence id="109">Some people, peasants, would would give us bread. </sentence><sentence id="110">I don't realize that they knew we were Jews, you know. </sentence><sentence id="111">Some of them had a hard life. </sentence><sentence id="112">They worked in the <span class="dlf">fields</span> and there were people wandering around. </sentence><sentence id="113">01:10:  Well some of them probably didn't even know about the political situation. </sentence><sentence id="114">I remember going to <span class="building">homes</span> where they wouldn't give us any bread or any water and they would say, you're probably Jews and you're wandering around. </sentence><sentence id="115">And we tried to stay away from better looking <span class="building">homes</span>, worrying that those people were better educated and they might recognize us. </sentence><sentence id="116">I lost track of time. </sentence><sentence id="117">I didn't know where I was at times, you know...what's going to happen to us and there were times that I really didn't want to live because we didn't know what tomorrow's going to be. </sentence><sentence id="118">You know, some people seem kind. </sentence><sentence id="119">Some people would point out to you and say, if you don't get out of <span class="populated place">town</span> we're going to tell the Germans and they're going to come and get you. </sentence><sentence id="120">And it didn't take long before we were arrested, and we were taken to some...the difference between a <span class="populated place">labor camp</span> and a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> wasn't much really, because the <span class="populated place">labor camps</span> kind of kept you a couple of days and they weren't as well organized as a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>, so it was very easy to walk out and to escape. </sentence><sentence id="121">And I remember walking away from the <span class="populated place">labor camp</span> with some...at that time I called him older man because I was like fourteen or fourteen and a half years old, and they told us that not too far there's some <span class="building">religious installation</span>. </sentence><sentence id="122">It's a <span class="building">convent</span> and they are helping a lot of people and I walked in to this...it didn't...to me it looked like a <span class="dlf">cemetery</span> because in in the front of this big <span class="building">building</span>...it wasn't actually a big <span class="building">building</span> but there was a like a <span class="dlf">gate</span> and <span class="dlf">cemetery</span>, a big <span class="dlf">cemetery plot</span> and then we noticed nuns dressed in habits 01:12: and we waited until not too many people were around. </sentence><sentence id="123">There were like four of us I believe, and we walked in and we told them that we needed help, that we have no place to go and they asked us if we were Jews and we told them. </sentence><sentence id="124">I mean at that point there was no place of hiding and I had a feeling that if nuns are not going to help us, you know, then there's no sense going on, and they told us they were crowded, that they had a lot of infants. </sentence><sentence id="125">They had a lot of sick people and they indeed did, but this Mother Superior that I called it... Theresa was her name, Mother Theresa. </sentence><sentence id="126">By the way, they were Carmelites, and there were a lot of Volksdeutsche. </sentence><sentence id="127">You know what a <span class="building">Volksdeutsche</span> is? </sentence><sentence id="128">The mother can be Polish and the father can be German. </sentence><sentence id="129">A lot of them were mixed, and they took us in and they told us that we had to be very quiet and it was a <span class="interior space">basement</span> where they put us and sometimes we did chores for them and they gave us some food and they really didn't know how long we could stay because they were constantly being watched by neighbors, you know, and sometimes they could tell them stories so they could explain what was going on but most of the time they didn't see any of the police, any of the German police and we stayed there for several months and slowly they tried to explain to us that things are getting very bad and they are threatened they would kill them if they would find out how many Jews they had. </sentence><sentence id="130">They had quite a few later on we found out. </sentence><sentence id="131">We heard the babies cry at night. </sentence><sentence id="132">01:14: We saw corpses being taken out of very old people and finally they told us that we have  to go. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="190">Q: Did they give you anything while you were there, any...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="192">A: Well, they gave us <span class="spatial object">cross</span> and a <span class="spatial object">prayer book</span>. </sentence><sentence id="193">They tried very much to convert us and some of them did. </sentence><sentence id="194">I was kind of scared, you know. </sentence><sentence id="195">I told them that I believe in my God, that I'm Jewish and I was scared that my Jewish...you know, I was a child, you know. </sentence><sentence id="196">I told them in my own words that if I accept your religion my God's going to punish me and I was scared to do it and I said I respect your religion. </sentence><sentence id="197">I would always respect it and if it can save my life I'll wear your <span class="spatial object">cross</span> and I'll treasure that prayer book that I still have and I want the <span class="building">Museum</span> to have. </sentence><sentence id="198">I memorized all the prayers and when we parted they gave me a peasant blouse to wear so I wouldn't look suspicious. </sentence><sentence id="199">I would look like a peasant. </sentence><sentence id="200">And this was a very sad time to part with them because you had like a little security and I remember feeling good. </sentence><sentence id="201">They would take us into the <span class="building">chapel</span> to pray, you know, and they would make us kneel and it just felt good after the prayer. </sentence><sentence id="202">You know, I kept saying to myself, God, there's nobody Jewish to pray with me, therefore I have to pray with them and when we parted it was very sad and it was like dying 01:16: and I even told...there was one nun that took a special liking to me and every time she looked at me she would cry and she wanted me so much to stay there because she kept saying that I looked less Jewish than the others and there's really no such thing as looking Jewish, but because I was a red-head and the Germans believed that every Jew has dark hair and a big nose and dark complexion...it wasn't, it wasn't so at all. </sentence><sentence id="203">My mom had very fair complexion and I was always very fair, and it was very hard for this nun to part with me. </sentence><sentence id="204">She wanted me to stay but they were afraid and they let us go and this is how I ended up in <span class="populated place">Majdanek</span>. </sentence><sentence id="205">Pretty soon they rounded us up. </sentence><sentence id="206"><span class="populated place">Majdanek</span> was in the beginning to me...I can't say salvation but it was like a relief. </sentence><sentence id="207">Like I didn't have to run anymore. </sentence><sentence id="208">I knew it's a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> and I saw a pile of dead people outside and I saw conditions and I heard screams but in the beginning I was kind of happy because I knew that tonight I can stay here, that I don't have to run through the <span class="env feature">woods</span> because there's no one that extended a hand anymore like the nuns did. </sentence><sentence id="209">By the way, I'll go back to the nuns. </sentence><sentence id="210">They were very, very good to me, to us and I want you all to know that they risked their own lives. </sentence><sentence id="211">They didn't have much food and they shared it with us. </sentence><sentence id="212">My... 01:18 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="236">Q: How did you get from the <span class="building">convent</span> to <span class="populated place">Majdanek</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="238">A: We were just wandering around... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="240">Q: In the <span class="env feature">forest</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="241">A: In the <span class="env feature">forest</span> and the <span class="populated place">villages</span>. </sentence><sentence id="242">I really didn't know where I was. </sentence><sentence id="243">If you asked me where <span class="populated place">Majdanek</span> was, near what <span class="populated place">city</span>, I didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="244">It didn't matter. </sentence><sentence id="245">If you saw a crowd of people you kind of turned around because you were afraid. </sentence><sentence id="246">Everyone looked suspicious. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="253">After leaving the <span class="building">convent</span> we weren't dirty because we always had some water facilities you know to wash but when they they rounded us up on the <span class="dlf">street</span> where they took people from the <span class="populated place">labor camp</span> and there was no place to run. </sentence><sentence id="254">They took us on the <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> and they took to <span class="populated place">Majdanek</span>. </sentence><sentence id="255"><span class="populated place">Majdanek</span> was, turned out to be later on a pretty horrible place to be, especially for a young girl. </sentence><sentence id="256">I...at one point I didn't know that they had younger children than me but later on I found out that they had a lot of infants and nobody could approach that place in <span class="populated place">Majdanek</span> because apparently they would kill the infants and make lamp shades out of baby skins or soap from baby fat. </sentence><sentence id="257">We could smell it. </sentence><sentence id="258">We heard sometimes screams but we never saw it. </sentence><sentence id="259">Then there was another part of <span class="populated place">Majdanek</span> that where the <span class="dlf">windows</span> were always covered with chalk and sometimes we would come back from hard work...we would dig <span class="dlf">ditches</span> or whatever they would </sentence></p><p><sentence id="260"> 01:20: ask us to do. </sentence><sentence id="261">By the way, this <span class="populated place">camp</span> had a lot of Russian prisoners and they had high officers that lived separated from everybody else. </sentence><sentence id="262">They were treated much better. </sentence><sentence id="263">They would interrogate them, maybe get some secrets from them, because I noticed that they were bringing them food and a couple of times they sent us to clean their <span class="building">barracks</span> and they had given us food. </sentence><sentence id="264">This is when I realized that they had some important Russian officers there. </sentence><sentence id="265">Then one day, and this is a a very difficult thing for me to talk, but it's history. </sentence><sentence id="266">We were asking a lot of questions. </sentence><sentence id="267">What is in this <span class="building">building</span>? </sentence><sentence id="268">What is in this <span class="building">building</span>? </sentence><sentence id="269">And that <span class="building">building</span> with the chalk kind of interested me because sometimes I would hear screams and I would see German soldiers taking women there, women that were maybe at that time maybe in their twenties or maybe older. </sentence><sentence id="270">They were developed a lot better. </sentence><sentence id="271">They were pretty women and apparently they made some medical experiments, because through one <span class="dlf">window</span> we peeked and we saw some men naked in big <span class="spatial object">tubs</span>. </sentence><sentence id="272">They were <span class="spatial object">metal tubs</span>, with ice and they would freeze them to a certain temperature and they would let the women undress and I guess they wanted to see the sexual reaction and this was horrible to watch and pretty soon it was the turn for us. ( </sentence><sentence id="273">Pause) (Crying) This is when you . ( </sentence><sentence id="274">Pause) And if you didn't do what they wanted you to do, </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="275">Q: Before we move on, let me...can we go back a little bit to what your experiences that you were talking about at <span class="populated place">Majdanek</span>, what they did? </sentence><sentence id="276">Could you be a little...tell us a little more detail? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="277">A: I think it was...I think they just wanted to see the men suffer and us suffer but you know, when we saw the women that, you know, when a fourteen or fifteen year old girl that doesn't have to eat, it's rather ugly. </sentence><sentence id="278">Her head shaven looks...some of the women were rather, you know, developed. </sentence><sentence id="279">You know, they were older. </sentence><sentence id="280">I don't even remember having any breasts, you know, and when you saw what they did...they threw them, you know, on top of the men and they wanted to see the reaction and they actually tried to force the man to have sex with them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="285">Q: What was your experience? </sentence><sentence id="286">Tell what they asked you to do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="289">A: They asked us to do the similar thing, but most of the time the men were like dead and it was just a horrible thing 01:25: doing that, and the screams and and I remember I asked to be killed.
