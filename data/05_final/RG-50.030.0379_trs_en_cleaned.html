<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1">Q: Hello Maria, welcome to <span class="populated place">Washington</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3">A: Thank you, Joan. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5">Q: Could you tell me the name that you were born with and when and where you were born? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="8">I was born December 26, 1918, which in <span class="country">Poland</span> is Christmas, so I'm a Christmas child. </sentence><sentence id="9">And I was born in the <span class="populated place">city</span> of <span class="populated place">Kolomyja</span>, which at the time I was born was <span class="country">Poland</span>, it was newly created <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="10">Before then, it was <span class="populated place">Hapsberg</span>, <span class="country">Austria</span>. </sentence><sentence id="11">Therefore, my parents spoke German and I was brought up in the German language. </sentence><sentence id="12">My parents eventually learned some Polish but they didn't like the language, so at <span class="building">home</span> the language was German. </sentence><sentence id="13">When I came to <span class="building">school</span> I naturally had to learn Polish so at the age of five-and-a-half I entered a <span class="building">Polish school</span> in <span class="populated place">Kolo-mier</span> (ph) and I said something in Polish which didn't sound right because it was not my initial language. </sentence><sentence id="14">So the children, including the teacher, started laughing, making fun of me. </sentence><sentence id="15">Naturally, it was quite traumatic. </sentence><sentence id="16">I ran <span class="building">home</span> crying, crying I'Il never go to <span class="building">school</span> again. </sentence><sentence id="17">Well, I did go back. </sentence><sentence id="18">And I've been a student for many, many years later. </sentence><sentence id="19">Interesting enough, when I thought about this experience many years ago, I think it played an important role in my later life choice of Polish as the aid of <span class="building">concentrations university</span>, strange as it may sound. </sentence><sentence id="20">But there are some dynamics that turned it upright anyway so this was my experience. </sentence><sentence id="21">Actually, I was writing still, I still am, and German and Polish are pretty much my languages even though, although they have both deteriorated. </sentence><sentence id="22">Well, the way I remember <span class="populated place">Kolomyja</span>, it was a small <span class="populated place">town</span>, although it wasn't small to the eyes of a child. </sentence><sentence id="23">And later when I visited the smaller <span class="populated place">towns</span>, the <span class="populated place">villages</span> around, it seemed that <span class="populated place">Kolomyja</span> was big. </sentence><sentence id="24">It's an interesting thing about <span class="populated place">Kolomyja</span> that, as I write about it just years later, many years later, that <span class="populated place">Ta- pan-gee</span> (ph) was an important <span class="populated place">city</span> during the earlier centuries. </sentence><sentence id="25">It's very old. </sentence><sentence id="26">They just celebrated seven hundred and fifty years of the birth of the <span class="populated place">town</span> and they say it goes back even further. </sentence><sentence id="27">It was This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="28">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="29"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection ransacked, it was demolished, it was burned all the way, many times, first by the Tartars, then by the Mongols, or vise-versa, then by the Cossacks. </sentence><sentence id="30">There were endless destruction's and occupations of <span class="populated place">Kolomyja</span>. </sentence><sentence id="31">I do not know how far my father's family goes back. </sentence><sentence id="32">The name was Hiersch (ph) and I was born as Matylda Hirsch. </sentence><sentence id="33">My parents wanted to Polonaise my name because that was important for them, I assume, as many parents do, but at <span class="building">home</span> I was called Mattie because my parents spoke German. </sentence><sentence id="34">My father spoke Yiddish with many of his helpers in the <span class="building">store</span> and business with some of the people in the <span class="populated place">community</span>, but my mother was very snobbish about it. </sentence><sentence id="35">She came from another <span class="populated place">city</span> called Chad- no-vich (ph). </sentence><sentence id="36"><span class="populated place">Czernowitz</span> was a bigger <span class="populated place">city</span>, it was a very snobbish <span class="populated place">city</span>, it was, they called themselves small <span class="populated place">Paris</span>, little <span class="populated place">Paris</span>. </sentence><sentence id="37">Her parents lived there. </sentence><sentence id="38">Actually, I knew only her father because her mother died just before I was born and I was named after her mother. </sentence><sentence id="39">So she had that air of <span class="populated place">Czernowitz</span> about her and she despised <span class="populated place">Kolomyja</span> and she despised <span class="populated place">Ukrainian town</span> and she despised the Polish people and she didn't want to hear any of the Yiddish language. </sentence><sentence id="40">So, sadly enough, I was brought up in the German language and German was the language, but certainly I spoke Polish later and, with my girlfriends it was always Polish. </sentence><sentence id="41">There was a <span class="populated place">city</span> itself, I saw it only forty years ago for the first time I went back. </sentence><sentence id="42">It's a handsome <span class="populated place">city</span> now and as I read some of it's history, it had a rich history, over the centuries it was a <span class="populated place">town</span> in which a lot of trade was going on. </sentence><sentence id="43">It was on the <span class="dlf">tracks</span> between <span class="country">Poland</span> and <span class="country">Austria</span> and <span class="country">Romania</span>, so apparently business and trade was very important. </sentence><sentence id="44">My own father came from a whole generation of people who owned the same <span class="building">store</span>, the same <span class="building">business</span>. </sentence><sentence id="45">This was porcelain and enamel and glass. </sentence><sentence id="46">So we always had the very beautiful <span class="spatial object">table</span> settings because of their availability. </sentence><sentence id="47">I remember that when my older sister got married, and her husband didn't have a profession, so my father took him into the <span class="building">business</span>. </sentence><sentence id="48">But smartly gave him a special division of it, so he became the importer of <span class="spatial object">chandeliers</span>. </sentence><sentence id="49">It all sounds very, very strange but this was back in our time. </sentence><sentence id="50">My father was Orthodox, my mother came also This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="51">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="52"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection from a religious family, but not as Orthodox. </sentence><sentence id="53">So there was a little bit cheating, I suppose, but she wore a wig because it was important in our <span class="populated place">home town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="54">My father was a follower of Rabbi, he was a Hasidic, a follower of a Rabbi called Wishnitz, he came from the <span class="populated place">city</span> of <span class="populated place">Vinnitsa</span>. </sentence><sentence id="55">Apparently he was important in the Rabbinical dynasty and as a child I remember the Wishnitz (ph) Rabbi coming and staying in our <span class="building">home</span> and I didn't like it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="108">Q: Why? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="110">A: I was crushed by the, by the tone of all these people. </sentence><sentence id="111">He would come, I was very young then, he would come Thursday night for Sukkotbat. </sentence><sentence id="112">So on Thursday night, from the <span class="building">railway station</span>, he would come escorted by about 200 <span class="spatial object">hus-a-dem</span> (ph), some from his own entourage" and some from our <span class="populated place">home town</span>, and because it was dark, it was evening, they would come with, the German name comes back, "Falken", these lightings, strobes carried in the <span class="dlf">street</span>, <span class="spatial object">torches</span>, right? </sentence><sentence id="113">Now it comes back. </sentence><sentence id="114">I sometimes think in German from my childhood years. </sentence><sentence id="115">So they were full of torches and to the dark night of my <span class="populated place">home town</span>, which was very Anti-Semitic, although I wasn't exposed to it, I sensed it, and the women would stand on the <span class="interior space">balcony</span> and greet them, saw them coming in. </sentence><sentence id="116">Since I was so young, to me this was an overwhelming picture and I said I didn't like it. </sentence><sentence id="117">They all came into our <span class="building">house</span>, which was big and he would give him the biggest <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="118">In front of his <span class="interior space">room</span> was a Gabbai, a Gabbai was the assistant of the man who collected the quitels, and quitels is something that a Jew would write out on a paper asking the Rabbi for advice. </sentence><sentence id="119">So together with the paper I assume that the Rabbi got the money too. </sentence><sentence id="120">I suspect it so. </sentence><sentence id="121">But anyway, the Gabbai stood in front of our <span class="interior space">living room</span> where the Rabbi held <span class="building">court</span> and he would see people. </sentence><sentence id="122">Hundreds of people would walk through our <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="123">And to me this was overwhelming, very unhappy kind of experience. </sentence><sentence id="124">I was the youngest and I think on me it worked more than on my sisters because I was already born into <span class="country">Poland</span>, it made a difference. </sentence><sentence id="125">Since I'm the youngest, my experience of learning <span class="building">school</span> and otherwise was different than that of my older sisters. </sentence><sentence id="126">It shows you the meaning of history. </sentence><sentence id="127">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="128">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="129"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="150">Q: What's the difference in age between you and your sisters? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="152">A: Five years each, five years each. </sentence><sentence id="153">My older sister was Cyla, <span class="building">C-Y-L-A</span> if you want it, and there was a difference of twenty years between us all. </sentence><sentence id="154">I'm not sure, but something like it. </sentence><sentence id="155">She married Jacob Goldstein, a man from <span class="populated place">Lvov</span> who didn't have money and didn't have much of a profession, but he was the son of a Talmudist and to my father, that was important. </sentence><sentence id="156">So, there was a tremendous wedding, all my sisters had tremendous weddings except me, and their only son, Menek, survived the war. </sentence><sentence id="157">I don't know whether I should go into, she was killed in the last days of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and her husband was transported to the <span class="building">Belzec Extermination Camp</span> in 1942. </sentence><sentence id="158">Anyway, that was my sister, Cyla, and she lived a pretty middle-class, it was pretty prosperous. </sentence><sentence id="159">Her hobby was to do petite work, petite point, and I remember her beautiful pictures on the <span class="interior space">walls</span>, all her own work. </sentence><sentence id="160">This was her hobby. </sentence><sentence id="161">She was well known in <span class="populated place">town</span>, she had girlfriends and when their son was born, it was a great thing because he was the only boy in the family, until then we had nothing but girls. </sentence><sentence id="162">Now the next sister was Frieda, her name, my sister Cyla, was Cyla Goldstein, that was her name and her son is Menek Goldstein, and he survived. </sentence><sentence id="163">My next sister was Frieda. </sentence><sentence id="164">She was very beautiful. </sentence><sentence id="165">Frieda married a man who was a cousin, a second cousin. </sentence><sentence id="166">He came from <span class="populated place">Cal-es-sa-bot</span> (ph), from a <span class="populated place">resort town</span>, very well known spot in <span class="country">Europe</span>. </sentence><sentence id="167">His father was a brother of my father, but that was of a different mother so they were step-brothers. </sentence><sentence id="168">And therefore, it was permitted for them to marry, even so, they worried that they're offspring may suffer from it and be mentally retarded, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="169">She ain't, she's a doctor of eye diseases. </sentence><sentence id="170">She turned out to be okay. </sentence><sentence id="171">But this wedding, I remember vaguely. </sentence><sentence id="172">I only remember my dress, I don't know why. </sentence><sentence id="173">It was the most beautiful dress I've ever had. </sentence><sentence id="174">And their wedding was held in <span class="populated place">Stanislawow</span>, a <span class="populated place">city</span> a little bit bigger than <span class="populated place">Kolomyja</span>. </sentence><sentence id="175">This is somehow, I still remember. </sentence><sentence id="176">No, she lived in <span class="populated place">Karlsbad</span> (ph) which means she lived in a privileged place because <span class="populated place">Karlsbad</span> (ph) was a beautiful international spot and This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="177">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="178"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection he was making a good living, he had many patients so it was sort of high life. </sentence><sentence id="179">Anyway, in 1938 Hitler occupied . . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="209">Q: Wait, you've missed a sister. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="211">A: Oh, you want to go this way, sure. </sentence><sentence id="212">Then the younger sister, also five years younger, is <span class="populated place">Frania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="213"><span class="populated place">Frania</span> survived. </sentence><sentence id="214">By the way, my sister Frieda survived and in <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> they got out of <span class="populated place">Dorosig</span> into <span class="country">Palestine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="215">She's still alive, she's unfortunately in a <span class="building">nursing home</span> now and her husband died a few years ago. </sentence><sentence id="216">Then, there's my sister, Frania. </sentence><sentence id="217">She's alive, she lives in my <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span>, her husband was killed, and they're child, Laszek, Alex, was about three years old in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and miraculously he survived and he lives in <span class="populated place">New York City</span>. </sentence><sentence id="218">Though she later re-married and her second husband adopted him so his name is Alex Gitterman. </sentence><sentence id="219">And then comes me. </sentence><sentence id="220">I was the youngest. </sentence><sentence id="221">No, my sisters still had a background of <span class="populated place">Hapsberg</span>, <span class="country">Austria</span>, although Frania was very young then. </sentence><sentence id="222">In 1916 I believe, my parents ran from <span class="populated place">Kolomyja</span> because of the war. </sentence><sentence id="223">And they came to, they ran to a place which is near <span class="populated place">Sigit</span>, <span class="populated place">Marmorosk</span> I think, which is where Wiesel comes from, which was a <span class="dlf">border</span> of <span class="country">Romania</span> and <span class="country">Hungary</span>. </sentence><sentence id="224">There were large <span class="populated place">Jewish communities</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="225">My father went into hiding there because the Austrian army was busy trying to find men to fight their war, they needed my father naturally, so they lived a very, very difficult kind of life. </sentence><sentence id="226">I think they lived in <span class="building">Mon-room-a-vot</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="227">And at that time I still had another sister, whom I never met, she died right there. </sentence><sentence id="228">She was between Cyla and Frieda and I think she was fourteen years old when she developed a serious appendix condition and there was no time to get to the <span class="building">hospital</span>, she died right in my father's arms, I understand. </sentence><sentence id="229">Some things that I heard about years later, my parents didn't talk about it, but it was always in the <span class="env feature">air</span> and I suspected that something happened there, but I say, I was born after, I didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="230">Only about ten years ago, walking in the beautiful <span class="env feature">woods</span> of <span class="country">Switzerland</span>, my mother's younger brother told me about it. </sentence><sentence id="231">They talked about her in some ways, her name was Yetta, but it was hushed-hushed and it was never quite This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="232">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="233"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection there. </sentence><sentence id="234">I'm sure that my childhood was spent in a <span class="building">family</span> which suffered from depression, yet it was not, it was covered over. </sentence><sentence id="235">Probably because my father was a Hasidic and in the Hasidic tradition, joy and pain are mixed. </sentence><sentence id="236">So, I think so, in looking back at it that my childhood was very complex because it was a Hasidic family and my mother was, had that air of a bigger <span class="populated place">city</span> with more civilization and the <span class="country">country</span> in which I lived was Polish Anti-Semitic, so I would think I have the strength of all of that in some way in my own personality. </sentence><sentence id="237">But, I remember there were times of when my mother would cry and this was the anniversary, not only of the deaths of my sister and her daughter, but the death of her mother. </sentence><sentence id="238">They all lived in that hiding place near <span class="populated place">Sigit</span> there and my grandmother, her mother, died of a heart attack, apparently still a young woman, so for my mother it must have been a horrible loss. </sentence><sentence id="239">She would go to visit her father later, she once took me to <span class="populated place">Czernowitz</span> and this I remember. </sentence><sentence id="240">These things are very vague in my memory because they were not talked about, but it was there in the <span class="env feature">air</span> and from time to time I would overhear something. </sentence><sentence id="241">There's a good possibility I tried to protect myself from the pain too. </sentence><sentence id="242">So I grew up in this family in which I was extremely important because only years back later, I could understand the importance of me. </sentence><sentence id="243">Because I had to replace all these losses, I'm sure. </sentence><sentence id="244">So, I was an extremely overprotected child to the extent that I hated it, | was embarrassed by it. </sentence><sentence id="245">When I sneezed, there was immediately a doctor around me. </sentence><sentence id="246">When I went to <span class="building">school</span>, and I forgot my breakfast, somebody from the <span class="building">store</span> would knock at the <span class="dlf">door</span> of my <span class="building">class</span> and bring me the breakfast. </sentence><sentence id="247">My mother was extremely anxious about me and my parents over-protected me in a way which probably helped them some way but also did not. </sentence><sentence id="248">So my sister Frania, I think, was a little bit jealous, I never knew about it because no matter what I did was fine. </sentence><sentence id="249">Which means I wasn't prepared for the hardships of life that later came my way. </sentence><sentence id="250">I was a child who could never do wrong. </sentence><sentence id="251">And they thought I was bright and I did extremely well in <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="252">To the end of my sister because she didn't do so well, she was pretty and This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="253">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy.

</sentence><sentence id="255">I was, all of my, the grades were always above "A", you know? </sentence><sentence id="256">Once I brought a "B", I cried for weeks! </sentence><sentence id="257">I got a "B" in mathematics which was unbelievable because it was always "A's in other subjects and my preferred subject was Polish literature, romantic Polish literature. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="308">Q: Did this create a problem between you and your mother? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="310">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="311">I was a child who was smart. </sentence><sentence id="312">I don't think I was pretty, my sisters were pretty, my two sisters, Frania and Frieda were very pretty, but I never experienced a sense that I wasn't okay. </sentence><sentence id="313">Looks didn't matter. </sentence><sentence id="314">I was accepted. </sentence><sentence id="315">I say I was, scholastically, I did so extremely well. </sentence><sentence id="316">My sister, Frania, still remembers with pain that when my mother would go to the teachers for the periodic visitations, they would say, how come your daughter, Frania, cannot do that well?

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="371">Q: Were your friends primarily, if not all together, Jewish? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="373">A: All were Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="374">Well, in <span class="building">primary school</span>, what you call, <span class="building">elementary school</span>, there were non- Jewish students too. </sentence><sentence id="375">I do not recall contact with them. </sentence><sentence id="376">I had two close friends, both were neighbors on both sides of our <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="377">We use to visit with each other. </sentence><sentence id="378">My main preoccupation was with reading. </sentence><sentence id="379">When my girlfriends would come and to ask where I was, my mother or whoever was around would say, you'll find her in a book! </sentence><sentence id="380">This was my childhood, I was an avid reader. </sentence><sentence id="381">But I liked to play with them and both of them were killed, but we use to go away a lot. </sentence><sentence id="382">I think this too established my pattern of traveling later in life. </sentence><sentence id="383">For ten weeks, every year, my parents would remove me from <span class="building">school</span> a little earlier. </sentence><sentence id="384">It had to start the 15th of June and I wouldn't come back until sometime in September. </sentence><sentence id="385">Every year we would go to the <span class="env

things. </sentence><sentence id="388">So we went to the <span class="env feature">Carpatian Mountains</span> because my <span class="populated place">home town</span> is surrounded by the <span

her something. </sentence><sentence id="2367">I cannot remember whether he did or didn't, I didn't understand what this was all about. </sentence><sentence id="2368">I found out later that she pleaded

to go but how could I go? </sentence><sentence id="3454">For me the greatest danger was to go to the <span class="building">official employment bureau</span> to ask for a job because to go to <span

these Germans come to take us. </sentence><sentence id="3636">We understood by then that the <span class="spatial object">train</span> was being shipped out to <span class="populated

the beginning of the day will bring the greatest horrors to us when the Germans arrived to take us out. </sentence><sentence id="3638">So without saying a word to each other, the <span

anything else except that I wake up in the <span class="building">home</span> of a Polish woman in a <span class="populated place">town</span> called <span class="populated

after I woke up. </sentence><sentence id="3642">I don't know, it was a few days that I was pretty unconscious. </sentence><sentence id="3643">She said that when we jumped out a priest thought we were dead. </sentence><sentence id="3644">He was going to the <span class="dlf">cemetery</span> to bury some body, he saw these two girls from the <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> uprising, so he figured he's going to bury us, with a decent Catholic burial. </sentence><sentence id="3645">When he noted that we were breathing. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3646">So first he buried these people who he meant to bury, then he brought us to this Polish woman on the outskirts of <span class="populated place">Toe-mash-off-maus-off-yetski</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="3647">Poor woman but a very decent soul. </sentence><sentence id="3648">She was very happy to be able to be of service to these Polish revolutionaries, the Poles who fought, the Polish fighters who fought for independence of <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3649">So she treated us beautifully, I could see how poor she was but she treated us extremely well, and one day a neighbor comes in and she opens the <span class="dlf">door</span> to our <span class="interior space">room</span> and she wants to tell him, these are two girls who were in the Polish resistance movement. </sentence><sentence id="3650">He takes a look at us and he says, she look Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="3651">That night, Hel-linka (ph) was sick of me because she looked Polish, she said good-bye to me and I haven't seen her until years after the war. </sentence><sentence id="3652">I saw her again about two years after the war. </sentence><sentence id="3653">Hel-linka (ph) had blue eyes and she was blonde and she wanted out. </sentence><sentence id="3654">I stayed on, I didn't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="3655">The Polish woman was absolutely an angel, she said you have to go, you can't be here. </sentence><sentence id="3656">She wrapped up for me half her bread in a kerchief and two apples and early morning I leave. </sentence><sentence id="3657">I didn't
