<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="39">A: No, that was the thing you see. </sentence><sentence id="40">We were relatively well-off, and also terribly conservative economically. </sentence><sentence id="41">So, we had no debt, and never borrowed from anybody for anything, and the result is that we were relatively well off when things went awry. </sentence><sentence id="42">But, there was a fund, of course, for the future, for my education [indecipherable] and that suddenly disappeared, because they knew that my father was mortally ill, and we were going to have to take over in some fashion, and this is -- this would be very dis- disorganizing, as it was. </sentence><sentence id="43">And so -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="44">Q: Did he -- excuse me -- did he have his own business, your father? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="45">A: No, no. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="89">Q: I see. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="91">A: Because not only did we not have enough money to cover that, but I knew that with a <span class="building">high school</span> education, at that time when jobs were very scarce, I didn't have much of a chance. </sentence><sentence id="92">So -- but I did have an interest, and the interest was in journalism, which actually I developed in the <span class="building">grammar school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="93">And before I got out of <span class="building">grammar school</span>, I had an idea, I--I had a-- I wa -- a little play friend, the -- these correspondences with children from other places. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="97">Q: Oh, <span class="building">pen-pal</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="99">A: Yeah, one of -- one of my teachers went to, of all places, <span class="region">western Australia</span>, which is just -- just about west of anything in the wor -- in the world. </sentence><sentence id="100">And so I-I got the -- my friend sent me the local paper -- matter of fact, all of the local papers. </sentence><sentence id="101">And I noticed that one was a weekly, which looked more like an American paper than any of the others. </sentence><sentence id="102">There was the lingering influence of the British journalism, with the ads on the page one and that sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="103">This was different, this had headlines on page one [indecipherable] news on page one. </sentence><sentence id="104">And I was really intrigued by this. </sentence><sentence id="105">And I had already started my self-education, read every book that had to do with journalism. </sentence><sentence id="106">I This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="107">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="108"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Brooks McClure " July 7, 2011 don't know whether I understood it or not, but at any rate, I did that. </sentence><sentence id="109">And -- and then one day I got the notion that maybe these people out in poor old <span class="country">Australia</span>, would like to have a correspondent in the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="122">Q: Not a bad notion. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="124">A: And I noticed that they had a regular correspondent in -- in <span class="country">Asia</span> who traveled around. </sentence><sentence id="125">And then they had another correspondent in <span class="populated place">London</span>, which was home to the Australians. </sentence><sentence id="126">And so these were very special needs. </sentence><sentence id="127">One was, of course, the local aspect, of the -- of news, and the other was <span class="populated place">London</span>. </sentence><sentence id="128">And -- but I said th -- I-I decided to write a letter to the editor. </sentence><sentence id="129">So I went to the British -- the -- I don't read it any more, but oh, I can't remember the name of it. </sentence><sentence id="130">At any rate, it's -- was -- it's a -- it's a British publication, similar, but rather more serious than the World Almanac for -- that we have. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="138">Q: <span class="building">The Economist</span>? </sentence><sentence id="139">Would it be <span class="building">the Economist</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="161">Q: Absolutely right. </sentence><sentence id="162">Absolutely right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="165">A: And so -- so I followed all the rules, and I used the simplest language, don't be fooled by the multi-syllable words. </sentence><sentence id="166">So I just said in plain English that I was a--a journalism student [indecipherable] without experience as of now, but I noticed their paper, and I noticed that they had correspondents in these other places, and none in the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="167">So would they be interested in taking me on, course free, as a correspondent. </sentence><sentence id="168">And I thought afterwards, what a stupid thing to do, you know. </sentence><sentence id="169">I consulted no one, and I got --I had the shivers afterwards. </sentence><sentence id="170">Then, in the normal turn of events, which between the <span class="country">United States</span> and -- and <span class="country">Australia</span> is about two months, I got a letter back, and it was from the publisher, who said, you know, we are -- we are interested in you. </sentence><sentence id="171">We have to know a lot more about you, but then he said, let's consider it a possibility. </sentence><sentence id="172">And so I did, I-- I found the name of the editor of the publication: that was on the masthead of course, And I wrote him and sent him a very This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="173">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="174"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Brooks McClure deg July 7, 2011 long article about the failure of the -- 0-o-of Roosevelt's policies. </sentence><sentence id="175">Because at that time, it were -- that was about 1937 was it, something like that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="188">Q: So you weren't even 20 years old? </sentence><sentence id="189">You were like 18. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="192">A: Oh, oh, I was far from 20 years old. </sentence><sentence id="193">I -- I was [indecipherable] nothing man, I had -- had absolutely nothing, so -- so -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="194">Q: But chutzpah. </sentence><sentence id="195">A lot of chutzpah. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="196">A: Oh, a lot -- a lot of --a lot of gall. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="198">Q: So, I'd like to turn this now to -- as you're speaking, a number of thoughts are going through my mind. </sentence><sentence id="199">When I've interviewed other people who were part of liberating forces, U.S. forces, most of them do not have the exposure that it sounds like you did, to news, to world events, to -- it-- to people who were different from yourselves. </sentence><sentence id="200">So one of the key questions that I often ask somebody is, before they even get to <span class="country">Europe</span>, did you meet anybody who was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="201">Well, if you live in <span class="populated place">Manhattan</span>, chances are you did. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="212">Q: And then my second question is, is that if you were interested in news and journalism, were you aware, even as a teenager, of the news coming out of Europe, of what <span class="country">Germany</span> was doing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
