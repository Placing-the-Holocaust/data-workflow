<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="143">Q: Tom, could you give me some sense, then, of the first impact of the Nazis when things began to change. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="145">A: Well, certain things did begin to change, and don't call it "the Nazis," because actually -- wait. </sentence><sentence id="146">You call Nazis the German Nazis or the Hungarian Nazis? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="149">Q: That's a good question. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="151">A: I know. </sentence><sentence id="152">That's why I'm asking. </sentence><sentence id="153">Which one do you want? </sentence><sentence id="154">Because that was two different period. </sentence><sentence id="155">Because <span class="country">Hungary</span> not necessarily was on the <span class="region">German side</span>, and the historical background comes out now in today's days because of World War I mistake when the biggest part of <span class="country">Hungary</span> was taken away. </sentence><sentence id="156">And Hitler was the only one who was supporting, because he himself was <span class="country">Germany</span>'s leader, to get back what was taken away. </sentence><sentence id="157">Now, I don't in history -- I have to give you the historical background, which I think it's important because that made <span class="country">Hungary</span> on the side of the Axis. </sentence><sentence id="158">And that made <span class="populated place">Horthy</span> on the side of the Axis, because <span class="country">Hungary</span>'s part was taken most. </sentence><sentence id="159">Now, today, and in recent history, when <span class="country">Yugoslavia</span>'s breaking apart, one and a half million Hungarians were living there, then the <span class="populated place">Rumania</span>, the <span class="region">Transylvania</span> was taken away when two million Hungarians lived there, and just two days ago when <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>, <span class="country">Slovakia</span>, the upper part of <span class="country">Slovakia</span> was -- the lower part of <span class="country">Slovakia</span> was mostly Hungarian, a million and a half. </sentence><sentence id="160">And that was the reason. </sentence><sentence id="161">And they were not Hungarian. </sentence><sentence id="162">It was a first only rightist government, and then it became more sliding to the right, more to the right, and at the end it became a Nazi government. </sentence><sentence id="163">But it was not a Nazi government until October -- even then it wasn't called, because the Germans occupied <span class="country">Hungary</span> in March 19th, 1944. </sentence><sentence id="164">And from March 19, "44, Horthy lost his power. </sentence><sentence id="165">He was just a figurehead. </sentence><sentence id="166">And in October 15th, when the government was taken over, those are the Hungarian Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="167">Then it became actual Nazi government. </sentence><sentence id="168">Does it answer your question? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="187">Q: It's a good background to it all. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="188">Q: So you came from a Jewish family; correct? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="192">Q: So there must have been some danger at some point that had an impact on you or your photographic activities were not exactly normal, I presume. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="194">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="195">In all honesty, you know, there were Jewish laws which started in 1939, I think. </sentence><sentence id="196">But there were one, two, three different kind of Jewish laws. </sentence><sentence id="197">But, personally, I was not affected by it direct. </sentence><sentence id="198">Not the photography, and not in personal life. </sentence><sentence id="199">But you knew what was coming. </sentence><sentence id="200">At least you thought you knew what was coming. </sentence><sentence id="201">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="202">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="203"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection And, let me put it this way. </sentence><sentence id="204">My brother, who was 11 years old -- 11 years older than I am, he married an American which was accidental. </sentence><sentence id="205">It had nothing to do with Jewish or not Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="206">And he came to the <span class="country">States</span> in 1939. </sentence><sentence id="207">And two days later or three days later, actually, he was called up for <span class="populated place">labor camp</span>, to serve in <span class="populated place">labor camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="208">But he wasn't there. </sentence><sentence id="209">I was there. </sentence><sentence id="210">Except the bad rumors. </sentence><sentence id="211">There were people who were affected; but, personally, I wasn't. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="252">Q: How? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="254">A: How? </sentence><sentence id="255">I knew the captain, and by then we had -- I don't know if you read it or -- we had exemption for my father and his whole family for the Jewish laws. </sentence><sentence id="256">And I was in the <span class="populated place">labor camp</span> but not as a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="257">Exempt and with different armband, and I was in very good friendship with the captain. </sentence><sentence id="258">And I said to the captain, "Goodbye. </sentence><sentence id="259">I'm not going to <span class="country">Germany</span>." </sentence><sentence id="260">And I was stepping down to the left. </sentence><sentence id="261">And that's when I went to <span class="populated place">Wallenberg</span>,? </sentence><sentence id="262">who I didn't know it exist, to the <span class="populated place">Swedish legation</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="272">Q: How did that happen? </sentence><sentence id="273">How did you come into contact with <span class="populated place">Wallenberg</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="276">A: My father's <span class="interior space">studio</span>, which I told you, did also foreign legations, people and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="277">And he, at least three years before, two years before, he took picture of Per Anger, who you mentioned. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="278">And-- [Technical conversation] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="279">Q: Allright. </sentence><sentence id="280">So let's just start again with how you came to make contact with <span class="populated place">Wallenberg</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="281">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="282">My father took his family pictures. </sentence><sentence id="283">He was a young man then, Per Anger, and his wife and little baby and it's about. </sentence><sentence id="284">I would say, two years before, this happened. </sentence><sentence id="285">And he also bought a <span class="spatial object">Leica camera</span> at that time, and I was teaching his wife how to use the camera because of the new baby and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="286">And then, I have seen them weekly as -- not friends, but in a friendly  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection atmosphere. </sentence><sentence id="287">I -- every week I -- we used to live in the -- it's a well-known <span class="building">building</span> in <span class="populated place">Budapest</span>, the <span class="building">Gerbeaud palace</span>, or the <span class="building">Gerbeaud building</span>, which was the most famous confectionery in all of <span class="populated place">Budapest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="288">And in the war, naturally, there was not too many chocolate, and I got a box of chocolate every week, which I gave to his wife, wife, because she loved it. </sentence><sentence id="289">And when I actually -- and it was an escape from the <span class="populated place">labor camp</span>, though I took it easy and I call it I just stepped aside. </sentence><sentence id="290">I, you know -- all I knew, my father also had the Swedish passport because he had Swedish friends. </sentence><sentence id="291">And very little, because I wasn't too much in contact by then with them, but I was able to go <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="292">And he told me about it. </sentence><sentence id="293">He told me, "You have also Swedish passport." </sentence><sentence id="294">And that gave me the idea that I go, when I escape the <span class="populated place">labor camp</span>, to -- right away, next morning, to go to the <span class="building">Swedish legation</span> and look for <span class="populated place">Per Anger</span>. </sentence><sentence id="295">Now, the way it actually happened was there were hundreds of people, that was on the <span class="region">Buda side</span>, hundreds of people waiting in front of the <span class="building">legation</span> asking for the Swedish passport. </sentence><sentence id="296">But the policeman didn't let them in. </sentence><sentence id="297">So somehow I worked my way to the policeman, and I asked him, "Would you please send a message to Per Anger that Thomas Veres is here and would like to speak to him." </sentence><sentence id="298">In about a half an hour, somebody came out, two other policemen, and said -- made on the loud speaker announcement that everybody should immediately leave the <span class="region">territory</span> of the <span class="populated place">Swedish legation</span>, immediately, except Thomas Veres. </sentence><sentence id="299">And a cold sweat was coming down. </sentence><sentence id="300">And they let me in. </sentence><sentence id="301">And I met Per Anger, and he said, "What can I do for you?" </sentence><sentence id="302">I said, "Look, I just left the <span class="populated place">labor camp</span>, and I'm asking you what you could help." " </sentence><sentence id="303">Oh, I introduce you to Raoul." </sentence><sentence id="304">And a young man came in. </sentence><sentence id="305">"Raoul," he said, "this is Thomas Veres, friend of mine, photographer." " </sentence><sentence id="306">Oh, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="307">You will be my photographer." </sentence><sentence id="308">And in ten minutes the official paper was made out that Thomas Veres is the official photographer of the Swedish legation of <span class="country">Hungary</span>. </sentence><sentence id="309">And Wallenberg signed it, and he gave it to me. </sentence><sentence id="310">I never used that paper because it wouldn't mean anything at all. </sentence><sentence id="311">But he said, "From now on, you will be my photographer, and you will do documentary what we are doing here for the outside world to show what's happening. </sentence><sentence id="312">You will report directly to me" -- not to the usual people who were working on the passports. </sentence><sentence id="313">And that's how I became his photographer. </sentence></p></dialogue>
