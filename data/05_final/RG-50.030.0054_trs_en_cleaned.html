<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="255">Q: Who played it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="257">A: The Germans. </sentence><sentence id="258">Uh, the Jews were not allowed anymore on the <span class="spatial object">trams</span>, not in <span class="building">public buildings</span>. </sentence><sentence id="259">They were kept away from this. </sentence><sentence id="260">They had to stay <span class="building">home</span> at certain hours. </sentence><sentence id="261">They...then they had...non-Jews were not allowed anymore to stay with Jewish people...Jewish people were not allowed to visit non-Jews...a separation became as a wake, suddenly, between the people who were your friends and people you had lived with all...all those years. </sentence><sentence id="262">And it went from one thing to another and finally people...L, I forget to tell that right after the invasion, a lot of people had tried to escape. </sentence><sentence id="263">For instance, in the first days after 1940, after the May occupation, I know, for instance, my parents also tried to escape. </sentence><sentence id="264">I go back now to a few days after May 10th, uh...because the, the images come up and they don't come in...you know...in order. </sentence><sentence id="265">Flies back and forth there. </sentence><sentence id="266">But, uh, my parents, too, ...they tried to escape with friends. </sentence><sentence id="267">They had to wait because the friends were coming and they...believe it or not they came with valises full of clothes. </sentence><sentence id="268">Because...you know...nobody understood what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="269">They thought they could take a <span class="spatial object">taxi</span> and they could drive to the Hook of <span class="country">Holland</span>, to <span class="populated place">Ljmuiden</span>, and take a <span class="spatial object">boat</span> and go to <span class="country">England</span>. </sentence><sentence id="270">But then by the time my parents and they got a...I don't know, a <span class="spatial object">cab</span> or a <span class="spatial object">car</span> or whatever it was, it was some kind of a <span class="spatial object">car</span>. </sentence><sentence id="271">Uh, we all were piled in and we drove but soon the <span class="spatial object">car</span> couldn't go any...anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="272">Nobody could get through, and the few people that got away in <span class="populated place">Ljmuiden</span>, they were just the lucky ones, if they made it to <span class="country">England</span>, and the rest had to go back. </sentence><sentence id="273">So there was a try, there was.... People tried to escape then, but later on they adapted to the rules and, uh, they hoped for the best. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="291">Q: Did you or any of your family members try to leave <span class="country">Europe</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="293">A: At that moment...afterwards, no. </sentence><sentence id="294">No. </sentence><sentence id="295">Only at that moment, at that time when most people tried to escape, but afterwards there was no opportunity, there was no way out because, uh, very soon <span class="dlf">borders</span> were closed and, uh, no...it was very dangerous and a parent didn't want to  USHMM Achives RG-50.030*0054 5 endanger his children. </sentence><sentence id="296">Uh, parents had parents too, older people they didn't want to leave. </sentence><sentence id="297">It was...it is an involved thing to leave. </sentence><sentence id="298">To get up and leave is a terrible thing, because you have to be thinking only of you, your children and maybe if your parents can go, but you cannot take the whole family. </sentence><sentence id="299">It...it breaks you in in two pieces. </sentence><sentence id="300">It's terrible. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="311">A: Despair. </sentence><sentence id="312">Hope that the Queen would survive and that the Queen could do something and that the Queen would take care of us all. </sentence><sentence id="313">But it meant...well, it meant..."My gosh, she left!" </sentence><sentence id="314">You know. </sentence><sentence id="315">That was unheard of...terrible! </sentence><sentence id="316">Not that she left, but understood because the Queen was a symbol of uh beauty, honesty. </sentence><sentence id="317">Uh, the Queen was looked upon as a wonderful, wonderful person, the whole family. </sentence><sentence id="318">I think most of the Jews were very royal-minded, at least in my, uh, surrounding, you know, so when she left it was quite a shock. </sentence></p></dialogue>

I don't recall exactly what evening. </sentence><sentence id="641">There was one Friday night. </sentence><sentence id="642">There was probably one Monday night, Tuesday or Wednesday...I don't recall the evenings. </sentence><sentence id="643">That meant that the children who were given to the <span class="building">Creche</span> to taken care...to be taken care of, to be loved by everyone, they went on <span class="spatial object">transport</span>, transport...those...during those nights, and that was terrible, the way it went. </sentence><sentence id="644">You see, the <span class="building">Creche</span> was meant for children of parents who worked during the day. </sentence><sentence id="645">They used to come there at eight o'clock, seven-thirty, between seven-thirty and eight o'clock in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="646">The parents delivered them, mother usually, and then they got clean clothes and they got breakfast and we played with them.

five-thirty I believe. </sentence><sentence id="650">When the mother was through with work, she came and picked up the child. </sentence><sentence id="651">Now an influx of new children came there, that were taken away from their parents. </sentence><sentence id="652">The <span class="building">Creche</span> was changed then. </sentence><sentence id="653">It used to have...imagine a <span

</sentence><sentence id="655">Next <span class="dlf">door</span>, next to that big <span class="dlf">door</span> is a smaller <span class="dlf">door</span> with a smaller <span class="interior

big <span class="dlf">doors</span>, they were usually not even opened. </sentence><sentence id="658">Every...the whole <span class="spatial object">traffic</span> went through there. </sentence><sentence id="659">Now let's get back to the big <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="660">On the right hand side when you come in, there's a <span

there was a small <span class="interior space">room</span> where the babies used to be. </sentence><sentence id="664">Mothers had babies too, and the babies came there too during the day, so from any
