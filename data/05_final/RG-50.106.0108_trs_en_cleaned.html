<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="748">A: Well, it's been asked of me a -- a number of times previously, including some video interviews. </sentence><sentence id="749">This ties in very deeply with my spiritual values. </sentence><sentence id="750">I think -- think that not only the mission of the <span class="building">museum</span>, of teaching people that intolerance, prejudice, discrimination, all these ugly phenomena that characterize our life on earth, have to be eradicated, eliminated. </sentence><sentence id="751">But we have to, ever so slowly, try to awaken to the fact that we are all members of oneness, we are all children of God, we are all brothers, we are all oneness, and as long as we continue looking at other people as separate and distinct from a -- from us, we -- we are not going to find our way back to our creator. </sentence><sentence id="752">And I am a firm believer in that. </sentence><sentence id="753">And I, in this sense too, I see my work for the <span class="building">museum</span> as -- as possibly indirectly contributing. </sentence><sentence id="754">Iam extremely impressed with the skill and enthusiasm and -- and -- and -- and energy with which the <span class="building">museum</span> was created, is being supported, is being developed and continues its work. </sentence><sentence id="755">And I want to be a part of it, but I also want to be a part of the general effort to teach all of us, and the <span class="building">museum</span> is doing its share, showing other, equally egregious holoca -- Holocaust-like experiences of other ethnic groups, be This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="756">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="757"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Wallace Witkowski % September 1, 1998 they Armenians or -- or just because some <span class="populated place">county</span> is in <span class="country">Asia</span>, that should not matter less than a mil -- million people were killed because they were Asian rather than they were other group, religious or ethnic. </sentence><sentence id="758">So I guess this is the best I can articulate at this point, why I committed to -- to -- to work for the <span class="building">museum</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="773">A: I only have concern that a lot of what I said is not going to be of -- really of -- of -- well, maybe it will be of peripheral value, peripheral value to you to -- to -- to see what kind of people volunteer. </sentence><sentence id="774">But I think the -- that -- that I volunteer for a slightly different reason than let's say a -- a typical, if I may use that word, survivor volunteer works for the <span class="building">museum</span>. </sentence><sentence id="775">There is a deep, tragic, desperate effort to make sure that the people who died, didn't die in vain, without any -- any lessons to be learned from it. </sentence><sentence id="776">So I can -- I respect my -- I-- I--I--I am in awe of these people who come and travel a long distance sometimes, to spend a couple hours in the <span class="building">museum</span>, just being escorts, or -- or guides. </sentence><sentence id="777">My commitment is the same and yet somewhat different, because even though all the men in my family died as a result of the war, except my father, who survived the war, but I had uncles. </sentence><sentence id="778">One, a pilot who died in <span class="country">England</span>, another persecuted and -- and killed by the communists, I feel that I have the need to assist in preserving the story of the Holocaust and teaching. </sentence><sentence id="779">In one of the interviews I said six million or seven million died, and they're silenced, so This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="780">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="781"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Wallace Witkowski %8 September 1, 1998 somebody has to speak in their place. </sentence><sentence id="782">Even if I am just translating little pieces of the -- of the story, I--I hope that I am making a contribution. </sentence><sentence id="783">And I'm waiting for them to give me more while my brain is still functioning. </sentence><sentence id="784">After all, I am 70. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="799">A: Definitely, if--if they just don't mind sending the stuff to <span class="populated place">Michigan</span>, to <span class="region">rural Michigan</span> rather than calling me to come in, or sending it to <span class="populated place">Arlington</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="803">A: No, I cannot think of anything. </sentence><sentence id="804">The difficult part of it is that even though that interview in 1990 was a two videocassettes long, I can still not -- I still cannot make myself look at it. </sentence><sentence id="805">Like I probably will not be able to listen to this interview that you're conducting with me today. </sentence><sentence id="806">It is helping me in a sense that somehow I unburden myself, that I -- that I lessen the weight of memory by talking about it, but I don't want to review it. </sentence><sentence id="807">No, I cannot think of anything else that I would like to add. </sentence></p></dialogue>
