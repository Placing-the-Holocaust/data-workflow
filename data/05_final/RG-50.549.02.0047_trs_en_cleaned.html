<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="28">Q: What did -- When you were a little kid in <span class="populated place">Budapest</span>, could you have imagined that now, this many years later, this is what you'd be doing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="30">A: No, I certainly did not. </sentence><sentence id="31">But I think that's probably true of a non-Holocaust person, too, that you don't really think what you're going to do as an adult, or even the fact that you're going to be grandparents. </sentence><sentence id="32">I mean, that's very old people, and it's very hard to think about. </sentence><sentence id="33">But I spent a lot of wonderful years, when I was in <span class="populated place">Budapest</span> with my father, going to, not <span class="building">Disneyland</span>, but to <span class="interior space">playgrounds</span>, and <span class="building">theme parks</span>, in a very small way, that - - with <span class="spatial object">roller coasters</span>, and all that kind of stuff, so I have very fond memories of that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="38">Q: [inaudible] ... Is having a good time important to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="40">A: Well, i -- when you say important, yes it certainly is, I'd rather have a good time than a bad time, you know. </sentence><sentence id="41">Important, I think at this point, health, and having my family remain healthy, and around me, is more important, but yeah, having a good time certainly is important. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="44">Q: Did the -- the going to the <span class="building">amusement park</span> with your family as a child -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="45">A: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="46">Q: -- how did that stay with you during all of these quite un-amusing times you've had -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="47">A: That always stayed with me. </sentence><sentence id="48">It's really strange, because I know we're going to talk about the Hidden Children a little bit later, but the very first meeting I went to after our Hungarian group was formed, we sort of introduced each other, and everybody gave a little blurb of -- of the -- the war years, and I kind of ended up, not meaningly, sounding </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="70">Q: You said they made up a fiction, what do you mean? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="72">A: Did you see the movie, "Life is Beautiful"? </sentence><sentence id="73">The Italian film that won all the awards?A lot of my friends thought the movie fictionalized, and trivialized the Holocaust, and I think you would have had to see the movie to know what I'm talking about, but it's -- when you see the movie, knowing it's about the Holocaust -- when I first went to the <span class="building">movies</span>, for the first 20 minutes I thought I was in the wrong movie, because there was a comedy. </sentence><sentence id="74">It was silly, it was Marcelle Marceau and Chaplin all put into one, before the Holocaust theme takes place. </sentence><sentence id="75">And it was basically about a father protecting his child. </sentence><sentence id="76">I This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="77">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="78"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0047 5 didn't think it was trivialized at all. </sentence><sentence id="79">I really related to it, because the whole process, in some ways, my parents made up stories that I was able to accept. </sentence><sentence id="80">So I never had their fear, I always had their very positive attitude that my grandmother who had died in the <span class="country">United States</span>, previous to the war, was a butterfly, and every time there was a butterfly flying around, it was my grandmother up there watching out for us. </sentence><sentence id="81">And to this day, you know, butterflies are kind of a meaningful thing. </sentence><sentence id="82">And there was always a positive thing, that things would be okay. </sentence><sentence id="83">So, I never had the fear that my parents had, but they wanted to be sure that I wouldn't, and I guess I didn't. </sentence><sentence id="84">I don't know if that makes any sense. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="101">Q: Sure. </sentence><sentence id="102">I -- Yo-You had said that you previously had been able -- your -- your mother had instructed you that if she said it was black, it was black, and you were not to question. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="105">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="106">That's absolutely true. </sentence><sentence id="107">That was probably the -- the only time that she spoke to me in very strong language, because I think somebody stopped us on the <span class="dlf">street</span>, and asked us about our religion, and my mother said we were Catholic, and I kind of pulled at her, and disagreed, and aft-after that, my mother said that at any time, that our lives depended on it, and it's very important that I not question anything she says, and if she says it's one thing, it's -- if it's -- yes, that's absolutely -- that's the truth, but -- no, no, I mean that -- that was -- and I think -- you know, I think the European children are sort of brought up that way, so it wasn't quite as difficult for me to deal with. </sentence><sentence id="108">You know, your -- you speak when you're spoken to, and you don't question a lot, and I don't think today's generation would get away with that. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="109"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="110">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="111"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0047 6 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="112">Q: Were there other instances where your mother -- where you had to comply with your mother when you knew she was not telling the truth? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="113">A: I think I -- well, the only other time, and it wasn't a ma -- even a matter of complying, but she -- she stole an egg, and I think I did tell that story in my video, and I remember that very clearly, cause everybody said where did you get the egg, and she said she ran into a <span class="building">farmhouse</span>, and chicken was laying an egg, and she took the egg because she made me a cake, and it needed an egg. </sentence><sentence id="114">A little yellow cake thing, and I -- I asked her about stealing, and I think she sort of -- gee, I don't remember all that well, but I don't think it was a major discussion, but she said that when you're hungry, sometimes -- it was there, she didn't think she was taking it from anybody else, so whatever. </sentence><sentence id="115">I was 10 years old, so I didn't go into it, in major, you know, depth. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="119">Q: Was it primarily your mother then, who shaped you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="121">A: I think so. </sentence><sentence id="122">My father and I had a wonderful relationship. </sentence><sentence id="123">He was a very quiet and very loving man, very successful in business. </sentence><sentence id="124">My father -- I think the reason for that during the war years, is that by -- my mother did not look Jewish, and I was a little girl, and I -- I don't know what -- what it looks like, but I guess I didn't look obviously Jewish, I had blue eyes, and -- my father definitely looked Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="125">He had a no -- you know, a nose that was more obviously Jewish, and not only that, but what they were doing is -- had men just drop their pants, and that was certainly easy to identify. </sentence><sentence id="126">So, I think my father, during situations where we were questioned, or had to negotiate to stay at someone's <span class="building">house</span>, or were stopped on the <span class="dlf">street</span>, my father always stayed in the background. </sentence><sentence id="127">In -- You know, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="128">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="129"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0047 7 during -- during the time of hiding, and also my father had a kidney stone problem, so my mother was very protective of his health. </sentence><sentence id="130">During -- Before the hiding, during the -- 01 -- the bombing, the air raids, my mother was in charge of the <span class="building">building</span>, and we went down to the <span class="interior space">cellar</span>, and all that kind of stuff, so she had more mobility, and was able to accomplish more, we stayed more in the background. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="146">Q: When you were growing up, though, before you were 10, before all of this happened, </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="148"> was he a strong presence? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="149">A: Oh yes, definitely. </sentence><sentence id="150">Every Sunday we went to the <span class="building">zoo</span>, we went to the <span class="dlf">playground</span>, we went to the <span class="building">amusement park</span>, and he would come -- I had this huge world map on the <span class="interior space">closet</span>, or the <span class="dlf">wall</span> of my <span class="interior space">room</span>, and every evening after he came <span class="building">home</span> from the <span class="building">office</span>, we would play a game of identifying <span class="populated place">capitals</span>. </sentence><sentence id="151"><span class="country">Countries</span> all over the world, and eventually <span class="env feature">rivers</span>, and <span class="env feature">oceans</span>, and stuff, and it was -- it was a different kind of life than today. </sentence><sentence id="152">The fathers came <span class="building">home</span> at the end of the day, mothers kind of took care of all the bathing and getting you to <span class="spatial object">bed</span>, and all that kind of stuff, but I had a very, very close relationship with my father, and a -- a very loving relationship. </sentence><sentence id="153">In some ways, I think I was probably closer to him. </sentence></p></dialogue>
