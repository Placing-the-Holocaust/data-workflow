<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="29">A: No, it wasn't a n-nickname, it was the diminutive, which is often done in -- in <span class="country">Greece</span>, to take the ending of the name itself. </sentence><sentence id="30">So Isaac is <span class="populated place">Saaco</span>, and it got shortened to <span class="populated place">Zako</span>, and that's how I was known by my parents, my brothers, and friends. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="50">Q: And you were born where? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="52">A: I was born in <span class="populated place">Athens</span>. </sentence><sentence id="53">My parents had migrated from the <span class="populated place">city</span> where they were born, which was at that time, when they were born, called <span class="populated place">Monastir</span>, part of the <span class="country">Ottoman Empire</span>. </sentence><sentence id="54">And after the first World War, they left because the conditions there were terrible, and ended up in <span class="populated place">Athens</span>, and that's where I was born. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="58">Q: L-Let's -- let's talk a little bit about what it was like to grow up in <span class="country">Greece</span>, and what it was like in particular in your family. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="60">A: Sure. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="62">Q: First let's talk about your parents, and then we'll go to your two siblings. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="64">A: All right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="66">Q: T-Tell me about your father and your mother. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="68">A: My father was -- when I began to understand the situation, my father was an accountant. </sentence><sentence id="69">He was th-the chief accountant of a very large <span class="building">company</span> that dealt in -- in importing textiles, and selling wholesale. </sentence><sentence id="70">My father was lame because he had polio as a young child, and essentially almost a club foot, which had then to be corrected in an operation that took place in <span class="populated place">Paris</span>, when he was a teenager. </sentence><sentence id="71">And he stayed on in <span class="populated place">Paris</span>, and did -- studied accounting. </sentence><sentence id="72">My mother was a -- a teacher in a <span class="building">school</span> in the <span class="populated place">town</span> where she was born, in an <span class="building">Alliance Frangaise school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="73">So, because they both very proficient in French, then it was compulsory to speak French at <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="74">Between themselves, my parents talked in <span class="populated place">Ladino</span>, or Judeo-Espagnol, which I had to do also with my maternal grandmother, when she visited us, because that's the only language she knew. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="82">Q: Now, did your parents come from a wealthy background, I mean, your father had been in <span class="populated place">Paris</span>, and having medical care there, as well as studying, or -- or not? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="84">A: Well, it's interesting that you ask that, because it's now that I'm finding out, through some of the work that I have done for the -- for the <span class="building">Holocaust Museum</span>, about my parent's backgrounds, and very slowly I -- I have found out, that especially in my father's family, they were very prominent. </sentence><sentence id="85">Both, I think, in financially, but also as leaders of a <span class="populated place">community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="86">My great-grandfather, Solomon, was one of the first 13 signatures in 1864 to open <span class="building">Alliance-Frangaise schools</span> in <span class="populated place">Monastir</span>. </sentence><sentence id="87">My grandfather Isaac, whose name I bear, which was another tradition in <span class="building">Sephardic homes</span>, was a president of the Jewish community of <span class="populated place">Monastir</span>. </sentence><sentence id="88">And my Uncle Solomon, who was my father's eldest brother, was president of the <span class="building">Joint Distribution Committee</span>. </sentence><sentence id="89">So, apparently they must have been a very prominent family. </sentence><sentence id="90">My grandfather -- and I still remember a letterhead, it was in several languages, but the one that I remember was in French, fournisseur de l'armee This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="91">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="92"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection turque. </sentence><sentence id="93">And we see he used to s -- to sell goods to the Turkish army. </sentence><sentence id="94">Grain, and other material, not -- not weapons, but -- so they had been in that business for a long time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="108">Q: So wha -- it's -- i -- why did it take you so long to find out, did your father not tell you about the history of the family, or -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="110">A: He -- you see, you have to remember, | think in Europe generally, avi was something peculiar to my family, parents don't exchange a lot of confidences when you're young. </sentence><sentence id="111">Things immediately change, magically, when you reach manhood, or adulthood in -- in <span class="country">Europe</span>. </sentence><sentence id="112">And then you become a friend, and things then open up. </sentence><sentence id="113">You see, I left <span class="country">Greece</span> when I was 19, to come to study in <span class="country">United States</span>, so I didn't have the opportunity to engage my father in reminiscences, so my brother -- younger brother, who stayed with my father until my father's death in <span class="country">Greece</span>, he knows much more sometimes, about stories that my father told him, than I had an opportunity to do -- to do. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="118">Q: So tell me what sort of a person your father was as a father to you. </sentence><sentence id="119">Wer -- were -- did you -- would you have considered yourself close, prior to the war? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="122">A: Yes, well not really close, again, because of what I mentioned before. </sentence><sentence id="123">We were not distant, but my father was a -- a very even tempered individual. </sentence><sentence id="124">He encouraged me in my studies. </sentence><sentence id="125">He insisted to review my homework even, I think, when I first went to <span class="building">high school</span> in the <span class="building">gimnasium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="126">There were things that he had no notion at all, whether mathematics, or physics, and yet he insisted to review the homework. </sentence><sentence id="127">I -- by contrast, my mother was a -- a very demanding person. </sentence><sentence id="128">Having been a teacher, and also temperamentally, she asked of me to do things -- to excel, to study my f -- French lessons, to practice -- at one time I started learning the violin at the <span class="building">Athens Conservatory</span>, but the war put an end to all of that, so I didn't pursue that <span class="spatial object">instrument</span>. </sentence><sentence id="129">So there was always a contrast. </sentence><sentence id="130">My -- my mother was much more demanding individual, my father a much more even tempered, but still expecting things. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="140">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence><sentence id="141">And -- and would you say that as a child you felt close t -- though they weren't sharing information with you -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="144">A: Right, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="146">Q: -- were you able to come to them with difficulties, or -- or were -- would you talk to your friends about those kinds of things? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="148">A: No, I would -- up to a certain point, then ev -- eventually I would have to learn to talk to my -- my parents, but I would talk to my mother, because I lived all day long with -- with her, and it was almost a natural thing for me, the first person to think of telling her about something. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="150">Q: And it would be her. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="152">A: It'd be her, yes. </sentence><sentence id="153">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="154">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="155"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="160">Q: Did you go -- y -- s -- when we wer -- drove here in the <span class="spatial object">car</span>, you talked about taking your kids for a walk. </sentence><sentence id="161">Did your father and mother go for walks with you, and -- and do things with you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="164">A: My father did not, because -- as I mentioned before, because of his lameness. </sentence><sentence id="165">My mother took me about four or five <span class="dlf">blocks</span> away from -- from the <span class="building">house</span> where we -- I grew up. </sentence><sentence id="166">There was a little <span class="dlf">park</span>, and then she would take us, I'm sure when I was very young. </sentence><sentence id="167">Later on, when I reached the age of 10, I then started taking my younger brother on walks. </sentence><sentence id="168">Another thing that I remember we did very frequently was -- as I said, my maternal grandmother visited us twice a week, she lived with a -- an aunt. </sentence><sentence id="169">And it was really for an able person, it was let's say, a 15 minute walk. </sentence><sentence id="170">But for my grandmother, it turn out to be maybe a half an hour, or a little bit more, because she was older, and she would have to rest from time to time. </sentence><sentence id="171">And the little <span class="dlf">park</span> was on the way, so we're -- I would go to the <span class="spatial object">keropper</span>, and we would eventually reach the <span class="dlf">park</span>, sit at the <span class="spatial object">bench</span>, let her rest. </sentence><sentence id="172">And my mother would come sometimes together. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="182">Q: When di -- because I didn't know this, when -- when did you start violin lessons? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="184">A: Oh, I started violin lessons when I was eight or nine years old, maybe 10. </sentence><sentence id="185">But I started <span class="building">school</span> when I was four, the reason being that that was when my second brother was born, Samuel. </sentence><sentence id="186">And I don't know, perhaps I was too much, and my mother needed to have free time to care for my brother. </sentence><sentence id="187">She knew the teacher in the <span class="building">Jewish school</span>, which was around the corner from my <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="188">So she asked her if sh -- I could go there for a few hours, just sort of to be kept, and not to interfere with the <span class="building">house</span> affairs. </sentence><sentence id="189">But apparently I must have picked up, because there from then on, I continued, and I went to -- to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="190">But I think usually at the end of a <span class="building">school</span> year, then my actual age would be apparent to the teachers. </sentence><sentence id="191">So the first six years of <span class="building">primary school</span> -- at the time I went to <span class="building">school</span> it was six years <span class="building">primary</span>, six years <span class="building">high school</span>, or <span class="building">gimnasium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="192">For the first seven years of sc -- of schooling, I changed <span class="building">school</span> every year, because -- for the reason I mentioned before, they would find out from my behavior I was a lot younger than -- than my grade, and they would wo -- washme -- wanted me to -- to remain for another year in the same grade, but of course, my parents did not want to do that, and I continued. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="202">Q: And your violin came in the midst of this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="204">A: The violin came -- yes, I started with a -- a private teacher, who lived a few <span class="dlf">blocks</span> from my <span class="building">house</span>, for about a year. </sentence><sentence id="205">And then my parents decided that I ought to go to the <span class="building">conservatory</span>, and I had to give an audition, and I was then admitted, and I started studying. </sentence><sentence id="206">I have -- I have to change, because now I remember, | started in 1939, so I was about 13 then. </sentence><sentence id="207">The reason I'm saying that now, in recollection, was because I was at the <span class="interior space">conservatory</span> for two years -- two and a half years, and then after the -- the occupation, after the war, it closed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="212">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="214"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="215">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="216"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="217">A: It closed for a -- at least a year, year and a half, that's what interrupted the violin lessons. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="219">Q: So you were very good to go to <span class="interior space">conservatory</span>, no? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="221">A: Well, but for only a year, year and a half, I didn't reach any exalted levels. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="223">Q: Did you love it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="225">A: At that time I did. </sentence><sentence id="226">The <span class="spatial object">violin</span> is a very hard instrument, and to -- to -- to make it make a pleasant sound, it -- the technique in itself is very hard. </sentence><sentence id="227">I had a boyhood -- childhood friend, two years older than I, Saby Shabetai, he lived in the <span class="interior space">apartment</span> above ours. </sentence><sentence id="228">And when I would eg -- do exercises, then the <span class="dlf">windows</span> were open, and then from time to time he would shout and tell me to stop that horrible sound. </sentence><sentence id="229">But I -- I persevered, but the war put an end to that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="235">Q: Right, right. </sentence><sentence id="236">And you have two brothers, Samuel, who was born in 1930, I believe? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="239">A: In 1930, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="241">Q: And -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="243">A: And the youngest, he was named Nehama, he was born in 1934. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="245">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="246">Tell me a little bit about <span class="populated place">Samuel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="247">Was this hard for you, when the second brother -- you were four -- you were four years old when he -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="251">A: It wasn't hard -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="253">Q: [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="255">A: -- but I think it's -- I can see it in my own children and grandchildren, that the four age difference, for the first 10 - 15 years, is almost an -- an unbridgeable gap. </sentence><sentence id="256">You have different friends. </sentence><sentence id="257">I -- I -- I didn't have, I ca -- as I recall, any problems with my younger brother, but I wasn't really that close to him. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="261">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="263">A: But in contrast, with the youngest brother -- let me call him Meko, because that's how we -- we called him, from the diminutive Nehameko, I was much closer to him. </sentence><sentence id="264">I was sort of his protector. </sentence><sentence id="265">I would take him for walks to the <span class="dlf">park</span>. </sentence><sentence id="266">I would sometimes supervise the first lessons that he had in going to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="267">And this is how we were growing up. </sentence><sentence id="268">I'm -- I'm sure that a little bit later on, if -- if things had not happened w-what actually happened, I would have been friendly with all of them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="275">Q: All of them. </sentence><sentence id="276">How do you account for being so close, or wanting to do things with the littlest one, and not with the one [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="279"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="280">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="281"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="282">A: I think simply that -- that I thought it was a natural thing. </sentence><sentence id="283">I -- I don't think I was asked by my mother, but simply I -- I felt that it was a natural role to play, because I was now big enough to protect him if he would go out and play, if another kid would attempt to beat him up, I would be around to -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="286">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="288">A: -- to protect him. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="290">Q: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="292">A: It was just a -- a role I -- | -- I fell into naturally. </sentence><sentence id="293">I don't think I was asked to do it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="296">Q: Was yours a <span class="building">religious household</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="298">A: We were observant in all the Jewish traditions, I'm talking the Sabbath, and of course, all the holidays. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="300">Q: So you observed the Sabbath? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="302">A: Yes, I think at the age of five and on, my Friday chore, before the actual Sabbath started, was to deliver a bottle of olive oil to the <span class="building">synagogue</span>, because in <span class="building">Sephardic synagogues</span>, there are no candles. </sentence><sentence id="303">Everything is in <span class="spatial object">glass containers</span> with olive oil and wicks that burn. </sentence><sentence id="304">And the thing that you do is to keep the <span class="building">synagogue</span> supplied with oil. </sentence><sentence id="305">And since it was so near my <span class="building">house</span>, then I would be asked to deliver a -- a bottle of oil. </sentence><sentence id="306">Also, my memories, both of the Sabbath, and -- and -- and the major holidays, they are visual, oral, and olfactory, because Friday afternoon, before the onset of Sabbath, when the <span class="interior space">dining room</span> and the <span class="interior space">living room</span> were closed, the <span class="interior space">floors</span> were waxed, and I still remember the -- the wax smell, which wa-was indicative of the preparations for the Sabbath. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="312">Q: And do you remember the smell of food, specific food? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="314">A: A little bit at times. </sentence><sentence id="315">I have more visual memory of the dishes that my mother cooked. </sentence><sentence id="316">Some of them were, at least visually, very attractive. </sentence><sentence id="317">And I also le -- remember at times when she would do a number of desserts that required the rolling of dough to a very thin layer, which today you can buy at the <span class="building">store</span>, it's called phylo -- phylo, which is a Greek word. </sentence><sentence id="318">But in those days, she did it, and if you don't -- you cannot roll it, you roll it up to a certain point, and then I remember she wore a sleeveless dress, and would powder her arms with flour, and then get under the dough and begin to pull it from every <span class="interior space">corner</span>. </sentence><sentence id="319">And you have to be very careful. </sentence><sentence id="320">Very often it would break, and there's nothing you can do. </sentence><sentence id="321">You would have to start all over again. </sentence><sentence id="322">So I remember these things. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="332">Q: Now, in the Sephardic tradition, are there particular kinds of Jewish dishes within that tradition? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="334"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="335">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="336"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection A No, I don't think it's a Sephardic tradition so much, as it is the tradition of the <span class="region">territories</span>. </sentence><sentence id="337">I think that if you take the cuisine that I think my mother -- first of all, I think because of the way she was taught, butter was never used. </sentence><sentence id="338">I don't remember seeing butter in my <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="345">Q: Oh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="347">A: Yes, it was -- first of all, you wanted to avoid having butter, in case inadvertently you used it with a -- a meat dish. </sentence><sentence id="348">But it was partly that, partly that both in <span class="country">Greece</span>, and in where she was born, there is not much dairy. </sentence><sentence id="349">At least -- <span class="country">Greece</span> is not a <span class="country">country</span> with lots of <span class="region">dairy land</span> to grow cattle to produce dairy products. </sentence><sentence id="350">Ev-Everybody cooks with olive oil. </sentence><sentence id="351">So there's a tremendous similarity. </sentence><sentence id="352">So, the -- the infusion is p-partly Mediterranean, partly Turkish, partly Greek cuisine, but I think in -- in my mother's case, there are some remnants of dishes that hark back, I think, from the 14" or 15" century in <span class="country">Spain</span>, because they were descendants of the Sephardic Jews who were expelled from <span class="country">Spain</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="359">Q: You were -- were you going to <span class="building">synagogue</span> on a regular basis, or more -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="361">A: Every Saturday. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="363">Q: Every Saturday you went? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="365">A: Every Saturday. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="835">A: Well, it was frightening because for one thing, by -- by that time, we knew what had happened to <span class="country">Europe</span>, what -- what ha -- what happened to Jews in particular, so we -- we knew it was not a good thing for us, all right? </sentence><sentence id="836">But again, th-there's another th -- aspect which becomes important for our story, that <span class="populated place">Athens</span> was occupied by Italians. </sentence><sentence id="837">I think Hitler, as a sop to Mussolini, gave him <span class="populated place">Athens</span>, and a few other larger <span class="populated place">ci-cities</span>, and regions of <span class="country">Greece</span> to occupy. </sentence><sentence id="838">Unfortunately, well -- I don't know if that would have made it -- it may -- it might have made a difference. </sentence><sentence id="839"><span class="populated place">Salonika</span> was under total German occupation. </sentence></p></dialogue>

</sentence><sentence id="875">We did not suffer very much in our family, because -- although we didn't get the kinds of foods that we were used to. </sentence><sentence id="876">Then I remember being sent by my mother to stand in -- on <span class="dlf">queues</span>, in <span class="dlf">lines</span>, to buy a piece of feta, a piece of cheese. </sentence><sentence id="877">And sometimes we would stand on <span class="dlf">line</span> for hours only to -- to reach the <span class="dlf">door</span> practically, and then be told that there's no more |-left. </sentence><sentence id="878">So we spent a great deal of time like that. </sentence><sentence id="879">But I was not directly affected with it in <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="880">We had to be very careful, I -- we were advised and admonished by our teachers not to make any politically overt statements in <span class="building">class</span>, for obvious reasons. </sentence><sentence id="881">But ho -- yor -- y-you knew that you were not entirely free to say what you wanted to, and you had to be very, very careful. </sentence><sentence id="882">There was no curfew in <span class="populated

school</span> in "42, normally I would have then taken the exams to get into the <span class="building">Polytechnic Institute</span>, but it was closed. </sentence><sentence id="884">The <span class="building">university</span> was closed. </sentence><sentence id="885">So I then, until the beginning of the Jewish persecution in <span class="populated place">Athens</span>, I worked for slightly over a year for a man who was in -- during the occupation there was a <span class="building">clan-clan-clandestine stock exchange</span>. </sentence><sentence id="886">We're not talking about

and occasionally bars, small bars of gold. </sentence><sentence id="888">And this <span class="building">market</span> was obviously entirely <span class="interior space">underground</span>, because it was under penalty of death if you were caught with gold. </sentence><sentence id="889">The way the <span class="building">market</span> was done, it was strictly over the <span class="spatial object">telephone</span>. </sentence><sentence id="890">Somebody would call and -- in the morning and say, "I have 10 -- 10 liras," they used to be called collectively, "to sell, what is the asking price?" </sentence><sentence id="891">And this <span class="building">market</span> would fluctuate entirely on what would happen in the international news. </sentence><sentence id="892">If the Germans were winning, then the <span class="dlf">Greek drachma</span> would lose even more of it's value. </sentence><sentence id="893">We talk about, by that time, a million drachmas, you know, it was -- millions was just like to buy some candy. </sentence><sentence id="894">If the allies were winning, on the contrary, then the <span class="dlf">drachma</span> would rise, because you know, naturally people thought that with the allied side winning, then the days of liberation for <span class="country">Greece</span> would come, and therefore the <span class="dlf">drachma</span> would gain, you know, gain value. </sentence><sentence id="895">So that's what I did. </sentence><sentence id="896">I mean, I would then -- my -- my -- my -- the -- the man I worked for would be the middle man. </sentence><sentence id="897">He would then sell -- get a buyer, get a seller. </sentence><sentence id="898">And then I would then have to from time to time, deliver the goods, which were rolls, maybe of 10 silver coins, and I would deliver them to the -- go pick them up, and -- and deliver them. </sentence><sentence id="899">And it was, you know, it was a dangerous thing, because if I was fa

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1553">A: Ransom had to be paid. </sentence><sentence id="1554">Then the deportation occurred, and actually, this was written up in the papers, because the then archbishop of <span class="country">Greece</span> wrote a -- a -- a letter to the Greek prime minister, the -- the collaboration government, protesting the -- this treatment of the Jews of <span class="populated place">Salonika</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1555">And very well known, he was threatened to be shot by the German general occupying <span class="country">Greece</span> at that time, and there's a equally famous reply that he made, and he said, "General Stroop, Greek -- Greek clergy are hanged, are not shot. </sentence><sentence id="1556">Please observe this tradition." </sentence><sentence id="1557">So, information was available. </sentence><sentence id="1558">Finally, I -- I -- I have to tell you -- which I have now pieced together subsequently, is my father's niece, the daughter of his sister, and her husband had escaped the last minute from <span class="populated place">Monastir</span>, went to <span class="populated place">Salonika</span> because they had family there, but they were told they were crazy to come to <span class="populated place">Salonika</span>, because it was under German occupation. </sentence><sentence id="1559">Go to <span class="populated place">Athens</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1560">So they came to <span class="populated place">Athens</span>, I imagine around May of deg43. </sentence><sentence id="1561">Italian -- I mean, that's still under the Italian occupation. </sentence><sentence id="1562">And I'm sure that from Allegra -- that was my cousin's name, Allegra Russo, and her husband, they were told whatever they know, because they had seen these things first hand, I mean, the treatment of the Macedonian Jews of <span class="populated place">Bitola</span>, it was unspeakable from the first minute of the occupation. </sentence><sentence id="1563">So they knew. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1661">Q: Now the reason why I'm asking is because does this mean that the Germans, when they come in, can easily get a list of who the Jews are, and where they're living? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1663"> A Yes, the answer is, I think, yes. </sentence><sentence id="1664">Now, the list may not have been up to date, because effectively, some people who are coming from <span class="populated place">Salonika</span> and other parts of -- of <span class="country">Greece</span> to <span class="populated place">Athens</span>, because of the favorable atmosphere of the Italian occupation, they didn't necessarily go to the community and register. </sentence><sentence id="1665">I believe, but I am not entirely sure a-about what I'm going to say, that when the rabbi received the instruction to issue then a proclamation for the Jews to come and register, I think the paperwork also went with him. </sentence><sentence id="1666">So he -- he or -- or -- or other people in the <span class="populated place">community</span> that went into hiding, hid -- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2589">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="2590">I should have go-got interviewed by an officer, not -- he was not the commanding officer of the regiment, and I think they are probably debating about what -- to have me do. </sentence><sentence id="2591">Certainly I was not either trained, or old enough to join a -- a -- a <span class="building">fighting unit</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2592">And then, the -- the same afternoon, I am called to go and talk to the second in command. </sentence><sentence id="2593">Let me parenthetically note that in <span class="populated place">ELAS</span> there was always dual leadership. </sentence><sentence id="2594">There was the military commander -- I don't want to -- | -- th-the -- the -- the second in command, it was not a rank, but he was the equivalent of a political officer. </sentence><sentence id="2595">If you want to call it a commissar, right? </sentence><sentence id="2596">Well, they were called <span class="building">captanios</span>, which is a gen -- generic name for captain, or -- or an officer of some rank. </sentence><sentence id="2597">So I go to his <span class="building">office</span>, and he told me that he has an important mission for me. </sentence><sentence id="2598">He didn't know me, but he had ler -- known that I was from <span class="populated place">Athens</span>, that I spoke French, and some Spanish, was a very important mission. </sentence><sentence id="2599">He says, "Every year, the little <span class="env feature">rivlets</span>, or even <span class="env feature">creeks</span>, which are dry most of the year, but in spring, after the snows fall, then these <span class="env feature">creeks</span> flood, and even the little <span class="env feature">rivers</span> flood, and -- and always there are people who drown. </sentence><sentence id="2600">Now, our mission, or the mission I'm going to entrust you with is this. </sentence><sentence id="2601">Because we don't know when the next sweep is going to come, and we want to be sure that our <span class="dlf">line of retreat</span> is available to us, we don't want to have to ford something that's not passable. </sentence><sentence id="2602">So what I want you to do is, I'm going to put you in charge here," I'm 16 and a half years old, "put you in charge of a -- a group. </sentence><sentence id="2603">And there" ll be two Italian officers, they are both engineers. </sentence><sentence id="2604">And your mission is to go to a number of <span class="populated place">villages</span>," which had -- he had written down, near some of those <span class="env feature">rivers</span>. " </sentence><sentence id="2605">And you will tell them that you have orders for the <span class="populated place">village</span> people to help you do two things. </sentence><sentence id="2606">First, cut down <span class="env feature">trees</span> to provide material for building the <span class="dlf">bridge</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2607">The Italian officers would measure, and find the appropriate place, and then you would -- the villagers would help with labor to cut the logs, and also with material such as nails, and things like this, as well as labor, to assemble the <span class="dlf">bridge</span>." </sentence><sentence id="2608">And so he gave me official orders signed, whatever it was, I don't even know if it -- there was a seal. </sentence><sentence id="2609">So -- and then I was introduced, there were in the outside, these two men, who had officer uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="2610">They were also armed, you know? </sentence><sentence id="2611">Now, I did not know Italian, but between French and <span class="populated place">Ladino</span>, I could make out a few things, and we could begin to understand each other. </sentence><sentence id="2612">I think they had been briefed -- that's now th-the word, about what the -- the mission was. </sentence><sentence id="2613">And so, the following morning, you have the Nehama group walking to our destination. </sentence><sentence id="2614">And it took us -- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2732">A: Look, I don't think we spoke very much. </sentence><sentence id="2733">I mean, occasionally the conversation would come back, because later on, when I was part of a real, ongoing military unit, after thes -- this mission of -- that I returned from. </sentence><sentence id="2734">And there was a large contingent of <span class="building">regimental headquarters</span>, where we were really living, and staying together, and talking. </sentence><sentence id="2735">Then we started exchanging, but in the first month or two, most of the time we are talking about is -- first of all, the next preoccupation, or the only preoccupation is what are you going to eat, because there is no food to be had there. </sentence><sentence id="2736">This is not a <span class="building">unit</span> where you're going to go for chow, when something rings, you have to scrounge for things. </sentence><sentence id="2737">So most of the th -- of the time, and necessarily is you're thinking about only one thing, survival. </sentence></p></dialogue>

id="2755">Because you got to remember, for the previous two years, that <span class="region">region</span> -- you know from time to time you would have incursions of Italians who would burn their <span class="populated place">villages</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2756">I mean, I saw the rems of that, the hulks of -- of just nothing but <span class="dlf">walls</span> with -- with the open

a-attack us. </sentence><sentence id="2760">They would put us up. </sentence><sentence id="2761">But they wouldn't show up. </sentence><sentence id="2762">And although tried to get [indecipherable] would say again following morning, the long and the short is we went through two or three other <span class="populated place">villages</span> with almost identical results. </sentence><sentence id="2763">But the -- the third or fourth <span class="populated place">village</span>, it was just, I think, after Christmas of "43, maybe December 28 or 29. </sentence><sentence id="2764">We got to this <span class="populated place">village</span>, and -- although the sa -- the story was the same tomorrow, but they didn't put us up in a <span class="building">house</span> in that -- in that <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2765">Instead they guided us something like close to a half an hour walk from the <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2766">And in the middle of <span class="region">nowhere</span> there was a little <span class="building">barn</span>, and it was two stories. </sentence><sentence id="2767">And in the lower part was a tethered donkey, and the upper was just a -- a <span class="interior space">room</span>, but it had a <span class="spatial object">fireplace</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2768">So he says, "This is where you're going to -- to stay for your -- during your stay." </sentence><sentence id="2769">All right. </sentence><sentence id="2770">So that's where we slept the first night. </sentence><sentence id="2771">When we got up the following morning, it had begun to snow incessantly, which continued for a week. </sentence><sentence id="2772">Now, very quickly we were totally snowbound. </sentence><sentence id="2773">Fortunately -- I mean, the way we survived is once a day, around midday or so, a poor, elderly woman from the <span class="populated place">village</span> would trudge all that distance, with a sack of roughly ground corn flour. </sentence><sentence id="2774">And that's our subsistence, we would take the corn flour and melt some <span class="env feature">snow</span>, knead it into some kind of a dough, and pat it to a semblance of a bread, and then we would burn it on the <span class="spatial object">fireplace</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2775">That's what we ate. </sentence><sentence id="2776">Now, the -- I think the second week, she brought us an <span class="spatial object">egg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2777">And we were, of course, you know, we haven't seen anything like this, and we were overjoyed, but very quickly we decided that it would be -- to divide it into three -- I mean, we would not even feel it in our mouths. </sentence><sentence id="2778">So we decided to keep it as a symbol of our eventual deliverance, both from the snow outside of that [indecipherable] the mission as well as the war, because -- and then I continue, very quickly, I mean we used the <span class="spatial object">egg</span> to play games with the mice. </sentence><sentence id="2779">The mice would come out at night, because it was the <span class="interior space">gallery</span> of all the [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="2780">And we had not thought, we had left the <span class="spatial object">egg</span> someplace, and then in the glow of -- still of the fire -- we used to go out and gather branches, and burn them. </sentence><sentence id="2781">We saw how mice steal the <span class="spatial object">egg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2782">One mouse takes it in it's paws, and sort of -- and the others drag it by the tail. </sentence><sentence id="2783">So we discovered the game, so we used to take the <span class="spatial object">egg</span>, and have bets made, and races. </sentence><sentence id="2784">We would leave it like this, and then we see the mouse come, and we say -- the bet was how fast he will get to the <span class="dlf">hole</span>, of course, by the time he reached the <span class="dlf">hole</span>, we grab the <span class="spatial object">egg</span> again, and -- so that's the way -- and that's how I began to learn Italian because spending all day long, we used to sing Italian songs. </sentence><sentence id="2785">And I clearly remember the first day that -- when the s-snow ended, it was the kind of a thing that you know when the snow clears, and the -- the <span class="env feature">sky</span> is completely s -- cloud free, and bright, blinding brightness because of the white, and we heard that drone of <span class="spatial object">aircraft</span>, which was an incredible sound. </sentence><sentence id="2786">And we look up, and we see huge formations of <span class="spatial object">bombers</span>, which we di -- concluded couldn't be anything but allied, because the Germans didn't have very much of an air force. </sentence><sentence id="2787">And -- and -- and -- and I think in retrospect, because we -- I know I can tell you, I can -- the direction which they were flying, namely <span class="region">northeast</span>, they probably were coming from <span class="country">Italy</span> to bomb the <span class="dlf">oil fields</span> in <span class="populated place">Ploesti</span> in <span class="country">Romania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2788">So, you know, we could almost -- the kind of a thing that we all three of us looked up, and -- and sort of begged that the day will come for us very quickly. </sentence><sentence id="2789">So, after -- after the second week there, we, you know, concluded that we were not going to get anywhere, especially now since the <span class="env feature">ground</span> was covered with snow, even if things had changed, the attitude had changed. </sentence><sentence id="2790">So, we -- I had lost also a sense of orientation where we were. </sentence><sentence id="2791">Where is the nearest <span class="building">partisan unit</span>? </sentence><sentence id="2792">We had been on the <span class="dlf">road</span> for practically a month. </sentence><sentence id="2793">So I was told, and we were pointed to some direction, and we got This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2967">A: -- because by that time, there was also another transformation that had taken place a few months before my arrival in the partisans, namely the partisans became organized as a modern army, with echelons, distinct divisions, regiments, battalions, companies. </sentence><sentence id="2968">At least on paper, all right? </sentence><sentence id="2969">And -- whereas before, these were independent <span class="spatial object">units</span>, marauding, doing whatever they could, but this was put on a much more professional footing, because by that time, the -- the man in command of the entire ELAS was General Sarafias, who was a professional military officer before the war. </sentence><sentence id="2970">So when I then was assigned to the <span class="building">regiment</span> -- now the -- the regimental commander was a -- a man who permanent [indecipherable] was a major in the former Greek army, by the name of Karfis. </sentence><sentence id="2971">And he happened to have as an adjutant, a recent graduate of the military -- <span class="building">Greek military academy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2972">So he was the usual, you know, not spit and polish, because we didn't have the things for that, but saluting, although there wasn't s-so much saluting with the partisans, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2973">The method of addressing each other was synagonistis, which means fellow fighter. </sentence><sentence id="2974">It was -- it wasn't comrade, it wasn't mister. </sentence><sentence id="2975">It was even t -- with an officer of superior rank, you would address him as fellow fighter, and then his name. </sentence><sentence id="2976">So, because I think of the fact that my background, finishing <span class="building">high school</span>, command of a language, and so forth, I was given a -- a clerical job, primarily enciphelment -- codes. </sentence><sentence id="2977">Because by that time, there were even <span class="spatial object">radios</span>, and nearby, because very near the regimental place, there was the -- the <span class="dlf">airfield</span>, if I can call it that, it was just a bare piece of <span class="env feature">ground</span>, but it was situated in the <span class="region">natural plateau</span>, the one that I fired, remember? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="3041"> A No, no, no, no. </sentence><sentence id="3042">Again, because it was <span class="building">regimental headquarters</span> -- now, it's fighting units, and sabotage are in the <span class="region">region</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3043">I mean, if I drew a <span class="dlf">circle</span>, it would probably cover, you know, a radius of 50 - 60 kilometers. </sentence><sentence id="3044">40 miles, you know, because the [indecipherable] adjacent things. </sentence><sentence id="3045">By that time, in the beginning of the partisan war, the major things that the partisans had to do -- wa-wanted to do, was A, kill known collaborators, primarily to elevate the morale of the people. </sentence><sentence id="3046">You know, begin to give them a sense that there are people who are protecting them. </sentence><sentence id="3047">That those who collaborate with the enemy are going to get their just desserts. </sentence><sentence id="3048">And because you cannot fight heavy engagements, there were occasional skirmishes, and fi -- and attacks with -- with isolated Italian, or -- or German units. </sentence><sentence id="3049">But in our <span class="region">sector</span>, when we begun to do a systematic thing of attacking <span class="spatial object">convoys</span> because our <span class="building">unit</span> was the nearest to the main <span class="dlf">road</span> that goes from <span class="populated place">Trikala</span> to eventually <span class="populated place">Kardhitsa</span>, and then <span class="populated place">Lamia</span>, and so forth, to <span class="region">south</span> [indecipherable] <span class="country">Greece</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3050">So that -- that was essentially the -- the -- the mission, if I can call it, of the regiment. </sentence><sentence id="3051">We -- we never got engaged. </sentence><sentence id="3052">We don't do that with the -- the light weapons. </sentence><sentence id="3053">The heaviest weapons I remember we had in the whole regiment was two heavy machine guns. </sentence><sentence id="3054">You can't engage an enemy that has <span class="spatial object">armory units</span>, with two heavy machine guns. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3080">Q: Are you getting news about the front? </sentence><sentence id="3081">I mean clearly the -- the -- there's a turn in the war, and there's been a turn in the war since 43, or late "42. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3084">A: Right, well, most of the spring, we knew -- first of all to us, through the British connection, primarily, as well as independently, the Greek connections, because of course, division talk to the agency in <span class="populated place">Athens</span>, or the top command of ELAS. </sentence><sentence id="3085">So -- but it would come to us two or three weeks late. </sentence><sentence id="3086">So it primarily still involves the -- the campaign in <span class="country">Italy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3087">The -- the great event occurs June six, when <span class="populated place">Normandy</span> occurs in the war. </sentence><sentence id="3088">We -- we get also news of the <span class="region">eastern front</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3089">But that was the -- the -- the first major event. </sentence><sentence id="3090">That really didn't have an immediate effect, other than si -- psychological, that now these two great parts of the allies are converging. </sentence><sentence id="3091">But I think through a -- the stream of -- of messages coming from <span class="region">division</span>, and from <span class="building">ELAS headquarters</span>, definitely show an increase in the pace of operations, for two reasons. </sentence><sentence id="3092">First of all, visibly, from reports, Germans are abandoning smaller <span class="populated place">towns</span>, and concentrating in major <span class="dlf">arteries</span> now. </sentence><sentence id="3093">Why would they do that, since no -- no -- nobody thought that the <span class="country">Greece</span> itself was about to be invaded by allied troops. </sentence><sentence id="3094">So -- so that was one -- one reason. </sentence><sentence id="3095">Then, also, the news began to -- to trickle down again. </sentence><sentence id="3096">We had more contact even from tiko partisans, who had much better communications, and already we began to see that the Russians are approaching the silent part of Europe, namely the <span class="region">Balkans</span>, and it doesn't take a strategic, Napoleonic mind, a short look at the map indicates that -- because <span class="country">Greece</span> is al-almost like a <span class="env feature">peninsula</span>, the bottom of the <span class="region">Balkans</span>, if the Russians were advancing that much, I think which eventually what happened is that the Germans would have an untenable position in this. </sentence><sentence id="3097">So, this explains why the Germans were consolidating their <span class="dlf">lines</span>, and because in the meantime, attempts had been made by the British mission to try to unite the warring factions of the Greek resistance. </sentence><sentence id="3098">And eventually, in the -- in June or July of "44, there was a -- as -- a signed agreement that was signed by representatives in the <span class="region">Middle East</span>, in <span class="country">Lebanon</span>, I believe, <span class="populated place">Beirut</span>, which then held until the end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="3099">So -- so we had this pace going on. </sentence><sentence id="3100">But again, the day to day life for -- for us, food was very scarce, as usual, although it was <span class="building">regimental headquarters</span>, th-they didn't grow crops or -- or other food. </sentence><sentence id="3101">Also clothing, and -- and -- and sanitary conditions were not -- I mean, if you went to sleep at night, especially in -- in the winter, well in the middle of the night, you know, people are getting -- or you sleep on the <span class="interior space">floor</span>, people are getting up and stepping [indecipherable] sometimes on bodies, make their way to -- to go out, maybe to relieve themselves. </sentence><sentence id="3102">But very often it was not for that reason. </sentence><sentence id="3103">You would go up, and open the <span class="spatial object">tunic</span> to let the cold air come in to quiet the lice, because in sleeping ne -- bodies next to each other, the lice begin to get warm, and begin to -- to move, and you -- it's not particularly pleasant, and to quieten them again, you go out, open the <span class="spatial object">tunic</span>, let the cold in, and they quiet for a bit, and you sleep for another hour or two. </sentence><sentence id="3104">Th-This -- this -- this persisted until when it became real warm in the <span class="env feature">mountains</span>, May, June, and on, because then you could go bathe in the <span class="env feature">streams</span>, and that would -- we used to do that every day, and at times it effectfully -- eventually happened to me later on, a month or two later, when I went swimming, and I had been perspiring, running to get to the place to swim, and I must have caught a cold, which was then misdiagnosed as malaria, and I had other problems. </sentence><sentence id="3105">But this was -- the pace noticeably started. </sentence><sentence id="3106">There were more action from our This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

class="building">headquarters</span> in the <span class="region">Middle East</span>, or from <span class="building">ELAS headquarters</span>, to harass Germans, even notably those who were retreating and going <span class="region">north</span>, but not to attempt any major action, even if we were able to. </sentence><sentence id="3109">The reason being that they didn't want to infuriate the Germans, because fay -- they didn't really have to infuriate them, they were doing that anyhow in many cases, namely, a scorched earth policy, they attempted to blow up the <span class="building">port facilities</span> in <span class="populated place">Pireas</span>, and it was only a last minute action by the partisans in the <span class="populated place">city</span>, that averted the blowing up of <span class="building">port facilities</span> in <span class="populated place">Pireas</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3110">So -- so noticeably we saw the pace accelerate. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3148">A: I hadn't seen any action, I -- only action I saw was a -- a month later, which was -- came out in -- inadvertently. </sentence><sentence id="3149">I don't think I had -- I -- I knew that it wasn't a question of roughness or the danger, but that really I had no experience, and I had seen enough of what had been going on to know that I should not be entrusted with lack of appropriate training, on -- on anything major. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3158">A: Well, food was always, I think once a day. </sentence><sentence id="3159">And most of the time, because that which was -- was available were -- I still remember them, black eyed -- they look like black eyed peas, or black eyed beans. </sentence><sentence id="3160">But these were from old, even sometimes abandoned <span class="building">governmental warehouses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3161">There -- the villagers would make flour available, whatever they were able to do. </sentence><sentence id="3162">And those things were usually spoiled rotten, and you'd find little crawling worms inside, but not after boiling, we used to joke that we would eat meat also, while eating the -- the beans. </sentence><sentence id="3163">But, again, rel-relief would come from hunger in -- in the summertime, when -- because of vegetables [indecipherable] vegetables. </sentence><sentence id="3164">I forgot what you asked me -- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3305">A: Many, many tunes, you know, as you know, they came from partisan, Russian partisan songs, but with Greek words, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3307">Q: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="3308">Now you -- it's clear that the war is closing, but there is an -- an action that happens that's sort of by accident. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3311">A: Right, the -- that's right, the only one that I participated. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3313">Q: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3315">A: Well very quickly, one -- one morning, if I -- I remember, it was close to 10 o'clock in the morning, and I was sort of manning the <span class="spatial object">telephone</span>, and it rang, and they asked the other -- at the other end, to speak to the colonel. </sentence><sentence id="3316">So, but I couldn't get the colonel, I got the adjutant. </sentence><sentence id="3317">Well, very quickly what tran-transpired, <span class="building">regimental headquarters</span> was in a part that was really a short distance from the <span class="env feature">plains</span> of <span class="populated place">Thessaly</span>, but it was a -- a suitable elevation. </sentence><sentence id="3318">And there was a -- a kind of like an entry, a <span class="dlf">pass</span>, a <span class="dlf">mountain pass</span>, and essentially what the telephone call said is four or five or six <span class="spatial object">German trucks</span> have entered this <span class="dlf">pass</span>, which had been manned by a very small unit of partisans, about five or six. </sentence><sentence id="3319">And we, of course knew that coming to the <span class="dlf">pass</span> and going south, ended in a <span class="dlf">cul-de-sac</span>, because there was nothing, after you've gone for another kilometer, just there was a w -- a <span class="dlf">mountain wall</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3320">So, when they saw that happening, you know, that's why they called to alert us. </sentence><sentence id="3321">They were not able, those who were guarding the <span class="dlf">pass</span>, to engage how many Germans there would be, and the nearest unit that -- of a sufficient strength, was at least three or four hours away. </sentence><sentence id="3322">So very quickly the commanding officer decided that the [indecipherable] is to fool the Germans into thinking that they are surrounded, that there This is a verbatim

http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0 are many more than actually we were. </sentence><sentence id="3325">So he dispatched anybody who could walk, including us clerical personnel in the regimental unit, to go, so we grabbed the -- our weapons, and after running for about 45 minutes, and out of breath, you could see down in that <span class="dlf">cul-de-sac</span>, and all the -- the Germans had se -- literally circled the <span class="spatial object">wagons</span>, and some of them had gone hiding. </sentence><sentence id="3326">And as they were being fired by the <span class="building">unit</span> that was guarding the <span class="dlf">pass</span>, they would return -- was rifle fire, they didn't have anything heavy. </sentence><sentence id="3327">And so we started firing at them, and they were firing at us. </sentence><sentence id="3328">And they -- since they saw things coming from both directions, they really concluded that they were in -- in dire straights. </sentence><sentence id="3329">And we were afraid that they would communicate via radio to their original <span class="spatial object">unit</span>, and they would come to relieve them, with a much bigger force. </sentence><sentence id="3330">But apparently, they either didn't have radio, or if they had, they didn't know where they were, see, they got lost. </sentence><sentence id="3331">And by that time, in about three hours, or -- the main fighting unit came, and started -- the partisan unit, firing at the Germans, and then, after about a few minutes, you begin to see a white flag, but just before that happened, suddenly there was a little noise, or -- or -- or sound near where I was behind a <span class="env feature">rock</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3332">And at the same time that I heard the sound, I also felt a -- kind of a -- of a pain, temporary pain in the right knee, and when I bend down I saw it was a tear, and something -- oozing a little bit of blood. </sentence><sentence id="3333">And it must have some part of a -- of a bullet that had hit a <span class="env feature">rock</span> and splintered, and part of the thing ricocheted, but it didn't go inside, I didn't find anything, it wasn't a major wound, and it didn't hurt, but nev-nevertheless when I was taken to [indecipherable] I was bandaged by a woman who turned out to be a Jewish woman, who had gone to <span class="building">school</span> for midwives, with a -- a -- a young girl, who was next door neighbors to us. </sentence><sentence id="3334">So -- but it was the only action that I saw. </sentence><sentence id="3335">I mean we -- we -- the number of Germans killed was, I think, eight or nine, and two were wounded, they were carried out with a <span class="spatial object">litter</span> and three prisoner. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3973">Q: -- how long was it wh -- after you had seen your father that you knew it was [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3975">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="3976">May I fo -- spend a couple of minutes -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3979">Q: Sure. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3981">A: -- to mention what happened to me after, in December of "44, when finally the problem -- the political fighting was over. </sentence><sentence id="3982">Our neighbor, who w -- was liberated by German -- I mean -- German -- British -- British troops, and Greek police. </sentence><sentence id="3983">And, I mean everything had been closed, there would have been -- had been no food, other than what one had, you know, kept in before the trouble started. </sentence><sentence id="3984">So the following day, I went and stood in <span class="dlf">line</span> at the <span class="building">grocery store</span> two blocks from our <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, waiting to get whatever, you know, was -- was available. </sentence><sentence id="3985">And five minutes later, after I started s-standing in <span class="dlf">line</span>, a number of police officers, gendarmerie come, and they're going down the <span class="dlf">line</span>, who is Isaac Nehama? </sentence><sentence id="3986">So, me. </sentence><sentence id="3987">Well they take me, and first they took me to the <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, and I saw my father, there were other policemen and gendarme around, some of them in civilian clothes, some of them in uniform. </sentence><sentence id="3988">And my father is really half hysterical, half -- not hysterical, I mean vocally, but frightened, but at the some time, also resolute, because they are doing searches, and so forth, and he had a few gold sovereigns left on his person, and they found it. </sentence><sentence id="3989">He -- at -- for a moment he thought that they were going to grab it away, and there was the only thing that we had left to our name, so he started shouting, and screaming, and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="3990">Well they -- they didn't take the money, but they took me away, they took me to the <span class="building">police station</span> and they began to pummel me with the butt of the rifles, because they wanted me to reveal names of EAM/ELAS people in the <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3991">I told them I hadn't been in the <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span> for over a year. </sentence><sentence id="3992">I was not a part of that before I left. </sentence><sentence id="3993">Yes, I was in <span class="populated place">ELAS</span>, but I went to survive, not to -- for political reasons, and certainly I did not know anyone in the <span class="region">neighborhood</span> of that. </sentence><sentence id="3994">Well, I was beaten for -- for quite a time, but at the end I was put in a -- in a <span class="spatial object">car</span>, and taken to the place which ironically, in the center of <span class="populated place">Athens</span>, was the place where the Gestapo used to round up their prisoners in the <span class="interior space">basement</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3995">It was a -- an <span class="building">office building</span>, had the <span class="interior space">basement</span>, or the base for a <span class="building">garage</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3996">And by the time I got there, it was dark, and I was -- a <span class="dlf">door</span> opened, and I was shoved, almost total darkness, except you could feel the smell and the noise of lots of other people. </sentence><sentence id="3997">In short, they had been rounding up people, and the following day they put us in <span class="spatial object">trucks</span>, they took us to a -- a c -- a <span class="populated place">mini camp</span>, a <span class="populated place">detention camp</span> with <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span>, near the <span class="env feature">shore</span>, <span class="populated place">Glifada</span>, which is a <span class="populated place">suburb</span> of <span class="populated place">Athens</span>, a s -- beautiful <span class="building">spa</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3998">And I -- I was kept there for a -- a day and a half, and then we were taken, and put on to <span class="populated place">Pireas</span> on <span class="spatial object">ships</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3999">We didn't know where we were going, and after a traverse of I think three or four days and nights, then also it happens in darkness we will disembark. </sentence><sentence id="4000">And we found ourselves in -- in the middle of a <span class="env feature">desert</span>, at least it looked like a <span class="env feature">desert</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4001">Now subsequently I learned it was <span class="populated place">Lugia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4002">Well, what had happened, the British then had taken all these things as prisoners, because the people of <span class="populated place">ELAS</span> had taken some British soldiers as -- as prisoners, so it was kept as a kind of bargaining chip. </sentence><sentence id="4003">Well, fortunately, in the meantime, my father, through frantic efforts, and a cousin of his, knew This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="4004">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy.

and now he's a -- a prisoner of the British. </sentence><sentence id="4006">Because two days after I arrived in <span class="populated place">Lugia</span>, then once a day some British soldier will come with a clipboard and mention names. </sentence><sentence id="4007">And somebody said to me, "Your name has been called." </sentence><sentence id="4008">So effectively, the word had come down, and

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4061">A: Well, look I can understand they -- they -- you know, they -- what they were trying to do, I -- I wasn't beaten by the British themselves, I was beaten by the Greek gendarmerie, who were, of course, doing the beating of -- of the -- I think the British, wa -- once I got to the <span class="building">detention place</span> in <span class="populated place">Athens</span> itself, and to [indecipherable], once we came under English army control, people not beaten. </sentence><sentence id="4062">If anything else we were well treated. </sentence><sentence id="4063">I mean, food was there plentiful. </sentence><sentence id="4064">In <span class="country">Libya</span> one day, a man came, an English, with a English uniform, and I saw in his shoulder a patch that said <span class="country">Palestine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4065">I took a chance, and I addressed him in Hebrew, the only phrase that I -- I knew, do you speak Hebrew? </sentence><sentence id="4066">And he says, "Are you," -- I didn't know how to -- I didn't know any more Hebrew other than that, but I told him my name. </sentence><sentence id="4067">Then he said, ""Okay, come in the evening." </sentence><sentence id="4068">Then in the evening he brought me a couple of bars of chocolate. </sentence><sentence id="4069">Tha -- of course, it wasn't really in his power to let me out. </sentence><sentence id="4070">But I was let out in a few days anyhow. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4093">Q: Did that do something to you, as a human being, did that -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="4095"> A Of course, I -- well, first of all, I was -- I was really, for one thing, taken aback that -- that such savagery was possible, and especially for something that w -- I had not done, or for - - I could not fulfill a request which in good consc -- I wasn't hiding anything. </sentence><sentence id="4096">It wasn't as if they were asking me the name of my <span class="spatial object">unit</span>, or where are they? </sentence><sentence id="4097">I would have told them. </sentence><sentence id="4098">There was nothing s-secret about that. </sentence><sentence id="4099">But they -- they were -- and I can see that this was not done at the request of the British, but it was simply on their own initiative. </sentence><sentence id="4100">It was that horrible thing. </sentence><sentence id="4101"><span class="country">Greece</span>, unfortunately, is the only <span class="country">country</span> where the resistance, which in spite of all of this horrible political infighting, at least did something to shore up the morale of the people, inflict losses on the Germans and the Italian. </sentence><sentence id="4102">It was never officially recognized until about 10 years ago, when finally Papandreaou, the minister who was now the prime minister is dead, rammed a law through one of the two <span class="building">Houses of Parliament</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4103">He didn't even clear both of them. </sentence><sentence id="4104">And this is the tragedy, the pity of Greek political life and affairs, that even after 50 or more years, they are not even willing to say bygones be bygones, at least recognize a contribution that was made, of substantial dimensions. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4117">A: All right. </sentence><sentence id="4118">Well, I then resumed my life in the sense that I began to prepare myself. </sentence><sentence id="4119">Now it's beginning of the year of "45, for taking the entrance examinations at the <span class="building">Polytechnic Institute</span> in -- in sep -- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4127">A: In September, right. </sentence><sentence id="4128">But it means preparation. </sentence><sentence id="4129">Well, of course the war -- war is still raging in <span class="country">Europe</span>, I mean, still going on, and finally it ends at the end of April of 45, and soon thereafter, the stories first trickle, then becomes a torrent, both in the newspaper stories, as well as the newsreels, to see the emaciated, things in <span class="populated place">extermination camps</span>, the <span class="building">crematoria</span>, the piles of corpses, and all this horror. </sentence><sentence id="4130">Well, what can one do but, you know, without any trace of where our loved ones are. </sentence><sentence id="4131">And it was not until I think beginning of August, of "45, that first on the radio -- at the time of news, they didn't have the things as bulletins, at the time of news, it would be an extended time that they took to recite names, because as news be-began to trickle down, and come down from Europe of prisoners from the -- the <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>, some -- in some cases the Greeks themselves, political prisoners who were in <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>, then there was also news from contingents of Greeks that had gone, some of them forcibly, some of them voluntarily, to work in <span class="building">German factories</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4132">But they got, of course also co -- caught by the fighting of the war. </sentence><sentence id="4133">Some of them never returned, and so they also had to be listed. </sentence><sentence id="4134">And then one day in the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence

information about this collection 5 beginning of August of "45, a neighbor called me and told me that she heard my brother's name mentioned. </sentence><sentence id="4137">But because I -- I didn't wa -- I didn't know whether she had heard correctly, whether she made a mistake, whether the -- the possibility of there being another person of the same name. </sentence><sentence id="4138">I didn't tell my father, and I immediately came down, it was very early in the morning, and I ran to the <span class="building">offices</span> -- the nearest <span class="building">office</span> of the newspaper. </sentence><sentence id="4139">I went to the -- and I -- and I told them what I wanted, and they had the list that it was going to appear in the afternoon paper, and then I saw Sam Nehama, comma, <span class="populated place">Athens</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4140">So I was confident enough because I knew that they -- we are the only Nehamas in -- in <span class="populated place">Athens</span>, so I then brought this thing with me, and show it to my father. </sentence><sentence id="4141">And now of course, there is no way, I mean, I asked at the <span class="building">newspaper office</span> how can one get in touch, because usually this information came via UNRRA, who was the relief organization that shepherded all these DPs, in the <span class="populated place">displaced persons camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4142">But there was nothing tangible, but while we are fretting, I mean, when we gonna hear, and when is he gonna come, the following day he called on the <span class="spatial object">phone</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4143">Now, on the <span class="spatial object">phone</span> he told us that he was in <span class="populated place">Bari</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4144">So, I thought meant that he was going to take the -- the <span class="spatial object">ferry</span>, which takes about a day to get to <span class="populated place">Corling</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4145">And then -- so we thought that it was going to be a few days more. </sentence><sentence id="4146">And then, about half an hour later, the <span class="spatial object">phone</span> rang again, I remember it was at the neighbors, and I had to run <span class="interior space">upstairs</span>, and it was Sam again, he says, "I -- I -- I called you from <span class="populated place">Corling</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4147">I didn't want to break the news so suddenly upon you that I'm here, I'm not in <span class="populated place">Bari</span>, I'm already in <span class="region">Greek territory</span>, I'm in <span class="populated place">Kolif</span>, which is an hour and a half. </sentence><sentence id="4148">So, I told my father, Sam is here, he couldn't believe it, of course he couldn't come -- I -- and ran to the railr -- <span class="building">railroad station</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4149">He came off, you know, was whole hundreds, literally, of people retur -- returning from <span class="country">Germany</span>, and Europe, and he had on short corduroy, brown corduroy pants, in the manner of lederhosen, you know, which I'm sure he must have gotten in <span class="country">Germany</span> from one <span class="building">agency</span> or the other. </sentence><sentence id="4150">And of -- of course, first of all the -- what impressed me was his size, it was -- he was a grown man, and -- and certainly he was not thin, he looked rather -- very, very healthy and well fed. </sentence><sentence id="4151">And -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4179">Q: And how old is he now? </sentence><sentence id="4180">You were nine -- you were -- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4185">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4187">A: Okay, he was 15 years old. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4189">Q: And he's a grown man [indecipherable] because of what he [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4191">A: No, no, he's -- he still, you know, has a youthful face. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4193">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4195">A: But he has the stature of a grown man, he was not the little, short boy that I had left before. </sentence><sentence id="4196">And let alone that in my mind's eye, having seen the newsreels, and read the stories, and when I knew that he was also liberated, you know, I thought I was going to see a broken individual, not -- if not ema-emaciated, or as -- a skeleton with skin, but This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="4197">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="4198"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 6 certainly even with premature gray hair. </sentence><sentence id="4199">Fortunately none of that had touched Sam, which I'm very, very happy for him. </sentence><sentence id="4200">I think in contrast, I think I had been much more affected by the -- the war, though I did not see the -- the horrors that he did, but by the separation, because I was at an -- at an age where I could begin to -- to think about things like this, and in -- in -- internalize them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4209">Q: It's interesting, because one would assume, theoretically -- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4217">Q: Yes? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4219">A: Originally, when I was told that you were interested in interviewing me, I told Sharon Mueller that I have nothing to say, compared to what Sam went through. </sentence><sentence id="4220">But Sharon is a wise lady, and she said, "The invitation is not proportional to the travail that one has undergone, with what one has to say." </sentence><sentence id="4221">So that persuaded me to come and -- and talk with you. </sentence><sentence id="4222">But I always think that the -- compared to what he saw, and what he went through, mine really paled [indecipherable] insignificance, except that things that -- the way they affected me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4227">Q: Affected you, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4229">A: I would -- perhaps I would have felt -- and I've had the same kind of -- of -- even if I was in hiding, because I was at a -- you know, even two or three years made a difference, and maybe my own inclination [indecipherable] was to -- to think about these things, and I thought a lot about them. </sentence><sentence id="4230">And the -- the -- the pain of not finding them, seeing them in newsreels what had gone on, and seeing the enormity of these things, all of those things then combined to very quickly |-leave, at least in me, what I perceive -- I cannot obviously speak for Sam and what is deep in his mind, but I had a -- a much more -- I felt it, I think more than he did. </sentence><sentence id="4231">That's -- I -- I think that I did, I'm -- I'm not sure that that's true, objectively. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4235">Q: But you also, in terms of being with the partisans, and maybe this makes a difference, not only were you older, but you had time to think about it, you had time to -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4237">A: Yes, although in both cases, there was always the question of survival. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4239">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4241">A: But can you imagine me -- when -- when he retells in his tape the Death March from <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> to only a <span class="dlf">rail head</span>, which is less than 50 kilometers away, and it took three This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="4242">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="4243"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 7 days, and no sleep, and you don't dare fall by the wayside, because you're gonna be shot. </sentence><sentence id="4244">I think a minute of that is more than the entire year of what I went through. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4251">Q: My suspicion is, but I don't know, is you didn't ask him, immediately what happened, you wa -- you waited until -- or did you? </sentence><sentence id="4252">Did you go alone before you went to see your father? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4255">A: Or -- no, no, I -- I didn't -- no. </sentence><sentence id="4256">I knew that my f-father was waiting and anxious. </sentence><sentence id="4257">I wouldn't have dare take Sam and say let's go and have a chat. </sentence><sentence id="4258">So no, we went. </sentence><sentence id="4259">But even in the subsequent days, because I did not know, number one, seeing the horrors in the newsreel, and not knowing yet to -- ho -- how much they had affected him. </sentence><sentence id="4260">Now, outwardly he's -- he's j -- fine, but I wanted to be careful, so I -- I -- I did not broach things like this. </sentence><sentence id="4261">And really, even things like -- when did you arrive in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4262">Even I asked him a few years ago, because then I wanted to find the exact date. </sentence><sentence id="4263">He said, "I can give it to you within four or five days." </sentence><sentence id="4264">Well, I went to the <span class="building">Holocaust Museum</span>, I went to the <span class="building">library</span>, found the famous <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> Chronicles of Danuta, and what do I see? </sentence><sentence id="4265">17" of August, an entry that a contingent is expected tomorrow of 20 odd thou -- thousand and t- twenty -- 2100 Jews from <span class="populated place">Rhodes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4266">It was a mistake, they didn't put the Athenians. </sentence><sentence id="4267">And then it says, me -- X number of males were given numbers, starting from B something to <span class="populated place">B</span> -- and I know Sam's na -- number is <span class="building">B7464</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4268">So he was right smack in the middle of that <span class="region">range</span>, so I know now the day they got to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4269">Now, I asked Sam what time of day, and he told me it was still dawn, almost, just before dawn. </sentence><sentence id="4270">Because I've tried to think when did my mother and father -- and my -- my mother and brother die. </sentence><sentence id="4271">Nobody knows, but from <span class="populated place">Sam</span> I know it was either the same day, or the latest the following day. </sentence><sentence id="4272">They didn't keep them. </sentence><sentence id="4273">They had no place to -- to -- they had to dispose of them. </sentence><sentence id="4274">So at least I -- I can -- I have narrowed the day of my mother's and brother's deaths. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4295">Q: But his coming -- his coming back was confirmation that no one else was coming, right? </sentence></p></dialogue>
