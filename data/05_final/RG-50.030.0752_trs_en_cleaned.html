<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6386">A: About that, I cannot tell you very much. </sentence><sentence id="6387">But you know, because first of all, the army kept away the prisoners from these people that they brought in. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6390">Q: Oh, so you saw them at a distance? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6392">A: We saw them in the distance. </sentence><sentence id="6393">We couldn't get so close to them, because of the fact that, you know, revenge would have taken place. </sentence><sentence id="6394">And in the <span class="country">U.S.</span>, don't take revenge on other people, you know, even, you know, they come into a <span class="populated place">town</span>, and they don't kill other people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6398">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6407">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6409">A: Because the <span class="building">prison</span> -- the <span class="dlf">wires</span> were all torn down. </sentence><sentence id="6410">You could go out through the <span class="dlf">wires</span> anywhere you wanted to go. </sentence><sentence id="6411">I used to go to the <span class="populated place">villages</span> and ask for things to eat, you know, in the beginning. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6415">Q: And did they give them to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6417">A: Oh, yes. </sentence><sentence id="6418">Oh, yes. </sentence><sentence id="6419">I think they had so much fear in them, that it was beyond belief. </sentence><sentence id="6420">You know, a guy nearby <span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span> was a mayor of this particular <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6421">He was made mayor right after the Germans moved away and the Allieds came in, the Allied Forces. </sentence><sentence id="6422">I don't know who installed him as mayor, but he was the mayor. </sentence><sentence id="6423">I walked into the mayor's <span class="building">house</span>, and I asked him, I would like to have a <span class="spatial object">bike</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6424">He says, no problem. </sentence><sentence id="6425">He gave me an address, and I went up there and tried to get the <span class="spatial object">bike</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6426">And of course, the <span class="spatial object">bikes</span> were all hidden. </sentence><sentence id="6427">You couldn't find them. </sentence><sentence id="6428">So you know, the idea is that the -- the reason I'm saying that, that the Germans had so much fear of being beaten up or being killed. </sentence><sentence id="6429">And in fact, some of them were. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6443">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6445">A: By the Russian prisoners, you know, the ones that were older, not the youngsters, you know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
