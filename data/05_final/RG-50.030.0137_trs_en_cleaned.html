<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="114">Q: When did this start to change? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="116">A: Well, of course, it started to change as a matter of fact even...let's see...in <span class="building">school</span> when Hitler started, you know, in "36 and then "37. </sentence><sentence id="117">We had in my class in <span class="building">high school</span> we had some uh native Germans, you know. </sentence><sentence id="118">They called them <span class="spatial object">schwabs</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="119">The German minorities and they already started, you know, uh sort of uh secretively first uh German sympathizers and uh talking loud and proud, you know, about the <span class="country">Germany</span> and Hitler and you started feeling a certain extent already uh but uh even then it wasn't too bad, but of course when the war broke out...let's see...in "39...1 would say...let's see...in "39...then in "41 it was not too bad in in my <span class="populated place">town</span>, but when in "41 the Hungarian army came in and occupied uh the <span class="region">territory</span>...there was northern part of <span class="country">Yugoslavia</span> where I lived... <span class="populated place">Voivodina</span>, and uh then uh of course when they came in they started uh...we were, as I...well...as I said I was half-Jew, right. </sentence><sentence id="120">But they were, regardless, the half-Jews and the Jews uh had to go to <span class="populated place">camps</span>, to <span class="populated place">labor camps</span> in uh the surrounding <span class="region">areas</span>. </sentence><sentence id="121">Just working every day, but we came <span class="building">home</span> at night. </sentence><sentence id="122">The real trouble started in 1942. </sentence><sentence id="123">In 1942, we heard some rumors...it was in January. </sentence><sentence id="124">It was a very cold winter, one of the coldest we ever had. </sentence><sentence id="125">If I recall it was like uh...with the celsius now, twenty-three below zero which was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="126">The <span class="env feature">Danube River</span> was frozen and we heard some rumors that uh <span class="building">Hungarian gendarmes</span> are murdering Jews in the <span class="populated place">neighborhood cities</span>. </sentence><sentence id="127">We couldn't believe it. </sentence><sentence id="128">We said it's just, it's just rumors. </sentence><sentence id="129">Nobody took it very seriously. </sentence><sentence id="130">And on the 23rd of January, there was a proclamation over the radio that no Jews or half-Jews can leave their <span class="building">homes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="131">Everybody has to stay <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="132">Still didn't realize what this all meant, but of course we couldn't leave. </sentence><sentence id="133">Then sometime in the morning uh my neighbor's, maid came over. </sentence><sentence id="134">She was a Hungarian girl. </sentence><sentence id="135">She walked across the <span class="dlf">street</span> and she come to my <span class="building">house</span> and she said that she heard some rumors. </sentence><sentence id="136">They saw some <span class="spatial object">vans</span>, some big <span class="spatial object">trucks</span>, and they saw blood in the <span class="spatial object">trucks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="137">So we still didn't realize. </sentence><sentence id="138">We still this...this is rumors. </sentence><sentence id="139">Must have been cattle or something. </sentence><sentence id="140">Then I remember around eleven o'clock in the morning, the <span class="dlf">doorbell</span> rang. </sentence><sentence id="141">If I recall I opened the <span class="dlf">door</span>...there was three Hungarian gendarmes and uh...OK...they opened the <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="142">They came in. </sentence><sentence id="143">The first thing they did...uh we had a maid also...first thing they asked the maid -  how is your boss? </sentence><sentence id="144">How are they treating you? </sentence><sentence id="145">And she said, oh, very fine. </sentence><sentence id="146">Then they came into the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="147">They spoke to my father. </sentence><sentence id="148">One of the officers went in to the <span class="building">library</span>. </sentence><sentence id="149">We had a big <span class="building">library</span>, a lot of Hungarian books. </sentence><sentence id="150">Oh, he says...you are Hungarian. </sentence><sentence id="151">He said yeah, you know, we're not Hungarian. </sentence><sentence id="152">We read Hungarian literature and as a matter of fact | have uha cousin in in in <span class="populated place">Budapest</span> who's in the Hungarian army, which happened to be true. </sentence><sentence id="153">Not that it meant too much, but uh...and I still didn't realize the danger. </sentence><sentence id="154">I didn't know what's happening in the <span class="populated place">city</span>, you know...what's going on. </sentence><sentence id="155">And they asked a few more questions. </sentence><sentence id="156">They talked to my mother. </sentence><sentence id="157"><span class="populated place">Dadada</span>. </sentence><sentence id="158">And they left. </sentence><sentence id="159">So that was all. </sentence><sentence id="160">So we didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="161">A few minutes later my aunt, my mother's sister, who's also gentile but her husband was Jewish...she came over crying. </sentence><sentence id="162">They took her husband away. </sentence><sentence id="163">So, so we didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="164">We still...you start worrying but you still don't know what's happening. </sentence><sentence id="165">And in the evening, that evening, we heard rumors that people were getting killed and actually those <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> were carrying people and the blood was human blood. </sentence><sentence id="166">Well next morning we found out what happened...about uh fifteen to two thousand Jews were murdered, including...my uncle across the <span class="dlf">street</span> was not murdered. </sentence><sentence id="167">He was saved luckily. </sentence><sentence id="168">He was already down on the <span class="env feature">Danube River</span> being ready to shot and at the last minute came an order from <span class="populated place">Budapest</span>, from Horthy's uh <span class="building">headquarters</span>, to stop the the killings. </sentence><sentence id="169">But another uncle, another aunt...uh two uncles matter of fact, two aunts, their daughter, everybody was killed. </sentence><sentence id="170">They were taken down to the <span class="env feature">Danube River</span>, shot and thrown into the <span class="env feature">river</span>. </sentence><sentence id="171">They had to dug a <span class="dlf">hole</span> because as I said it was frozen. </sentence><sentence id="172">Then it was frozen so they had to dug a <span class="dlf">hole</span> and throw the bodies into the <span class="env feature">river</span>. </sentence><sentence id="173">The only survivor was the dog. </sentence><sentence id="174">Their little dog was crying the next day...we went over there to see what happened and the <span class="spatial object">table</span> was all set for lunch. </sentence><sentence id="175">The food, everything was on the <span class="spatial object">table</span>...it was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="176">The dog crying. </sentence><sentence id="177">And then you heard the stories. </sentence><sentence id="178">Then you heard, this was killed, who was killed, what was killed. </sentence><sentence id="179">Some people were not taken to the <span class="env feature">Danube</span> like down the <span class="dlf">street</span> there was a <span class="building">house</span>, a good friend of mine who was my teacher at one time...they were killed in the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="180">Shot from close range. </sentence><sentence id="181">And then, you know, we heard that this friend and this friend was killed and we didn't know about the Serbs (ph) yet. </sentence><sentence id="182">Then we heard that the Serbs were killed also. </sentence><sentence id="183">A lot of Serbs, a lot of Serbs were killed. </sentence><sentence id="184">It was horrible. </sentence><sentence id="185">It was January 23rd, 1942, but that was only one day that they did the killing in my <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="186">And then everything stopped. </sentence><sentence id="187">Then a few days later we decided to leave my <span class="populated place">hometown</span>, <span class="populated place">Novisad</span>, and we went to <span class="populated place">Budapest</span>, the capital of <span class="country">Hungary</span>, and there life was still quite normal. </sentence><sentence id="188">We lived in an <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="189">My aunt lived there, who was gentile and uh my uncle of course and her family and we uh uh rented an <span class="building">apartment house</span> in <span class="populated place">Budapest</span> and uh lived there oh quite normally for about uh I would say nine months, ten months. </sentence><sentence id="190">Then uh one day they said...again it was in the papers... everybody who is Jewish or half-Jewish, you know, has to register...<span class="building">police department</span> I remember. </sentence><sentence id="191">And I went down. </sentence><sentence id="192">I registered. </sentence><sentence id="193">They said that uh in a few days we have to leave. </sentence><sentence id="194">They didn't say exactly where in a certain <span class="populated place">camp</span> and then when we went down there we got a white band so that distinguished you from a full Jew, from a hundred percent Jew...the white band. </sentence><sentence id="195">No star. </sentence><sentence id="196">Just a white band. </sentence><sentence id="197">And then we were taken, we were transported to uh a <span class="populated place">Hungarian town</span>, <span class="populated place">Hajduhatasza</span> (ph) was the name...about uh oh hundred kilometers uh south from <span class="populated place">Budapest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="198">Was a <span class="populated place">camp</span> sort of. </sentence><sentence id="199">We worked there. </sentence><sentence id="200">Hard work, unloading uh <span class="spatial object">railroad cars</span>, building <span class="dlf">railroad tracks</span>, you know, and uh just work everyday. </sentence><sentence id="201">We had food. </sentence><sentence id="202">We had food. </sentence><sentence id="203">It it wasn't really bad. </sentence><sentence id="204">I was uh I can honestly say that at that time we were not really suffering there. </sentence><sentence id="205">However, uh in the very beginning as a matter of  fact we were even permitted to go back to <span class="populated place">Budapest</span> on the weekend, you know, to see our parents and ... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="296">Q: What was <span class="populated place">Budapest</span> like at that time...when you went back? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="298">A: Normal. </sentence><sentence id="299">Normal life. </sentence><sentence id="300"><span class="populated place">Budapest</span> was still normal life. </sentence><sentence id="301">And uh the Jewish were still living, you know, in pretty normal circumstances. </sentence><sentence id="302">And then I uh recall one time when we went <span class="building">home</span> on a weekend, I saw a <span class="spatial object">train</span> coming from <span class="populated place">Budapest</span> and it stopped at the <span class="building">station</span> next to our <span class="spatial object">train</span>...see, and...let me see now...that was the year after, I'm sorry. </sentence><sentence id="303">Now the year after, when I was still going <span class="building">home</span> and this <span class="spatial object">train</span> was coming, and it was full of people, and at first we didn't know...it was all locked up, the <span class="spatial object">train</span>...you know, those cattle, <span class="spatial object">cattle cars</span>. </sentence><sentence id="304">It was locked up and we saw people in the <span class="dlf">windows</span> and crying and asking for water...then we realized...Jews from <span class="populated place">Budapest</span>, transported, you know, to <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="305">We didn't know where they were going, you know...we found out later. </sentence><sentence id="306">They are taking them to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="307">It was a horrible sight. </sentence><sentence id="308">Uh and as I say, then after one year we couldn't, of course they stopped us going back. </sentence><sentence id="309">They said we couldn't go back any more to <span class="populated place">Budapest</span>, and I was in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> and from then on...that was...let's see...from "42 to "44, but uh we you know, we were moved from that <span class="region">area</span> to another <span class="region">area</span> which was near the <span class="dlf">Romanian border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="310">Also same type of work. </sentence><sentence id="311">Luckily we had a pretty good commander. </sentence><sentence id="312">Our commander was a pretty nice guy so uh we were not uh really suffering too much. </sentence><sentence id="313">Some <span class="populated place">camps</span> were worse off than ours. </sentence><sentence id="314">In uh...let me see now...this is "44. </sentence><sentence id="315">Yeah, and then one day of course I heard uh the the German troops, of course, the German troops were going through our <span class="populated place">village</span> and uh one day uh a <span class="spatial object">German train</span> stopped and I was talking to this uh German officer...spoke German, of course...and uh asked him what's going on and he told me he just heard that uh the Americans landed. </sentence><sentence id="316">It was June 6th, 1944. </sentence><sentence id="317">But he says we aren't worried. </sentence><sentence id="318">He says, you know, we are very confident, he said. </sentence><sentence id="319">And of course he didn't know who I was really so he was talking to me like nothing was going to happen, you know. </sentence><sentence id="320">Was in 1944. </sentence><sentence id="321">Uh now uh about uh...let's see...a few months later, see as the Russian armies were getting now closer already to that <span class="region">area</span>, I had a friend of mine, an older...about seven or eight years older than I was...told me that uh one of these days now, Cornel, he says we are going to escape. </sentence><sentence id="322">We cannot stay here any longer, because eventually they're going to take us from here to some place else and, you know, we don't know what's going to happen, so we cannot stay here. </sentence><sentence id="323">You know, his plans where to take me with him to his <span class="populated place">hometown</span>, escape and go to his <span class="populated place">hometown</span> and, of course, he knew that I spoke Russian. </sentence><sentence id="324">And uh in fact the Russian army was coming. </sentence><sentence id="325">He, he ......for selfish reasons but more that he knew that I'm going to be able to communicate with the Russians and which is going to help him indirectly. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="354">Q: What was it like for you at that time in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> (ph)? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="356">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="357">Not really. </sentence><sentence id="358">Not really, because I think that the commander knew that the Russians are...of course, he knew, he knew that the Russians are coming. </sentence><sentence id="359">It was obvious. </sentence><sentence id="360">And he figured if he is nice to us, it's going to be better for him you see. </sentence><sentence id="361">So uh, which was true in a way. </sentence><sentence id="362">But anyway, so this uh friend of mine, one day uh we were told that the <span class="spatial object">train</span> is going to  pull out, oh in about three or four hours and go to some other destination. </sentence><sentence id="363">Didn't know where but anyway we're leaving this this place. </sentence><sentence id="364">So he told me...he says, Cornel - the <span class="spatial object">train</span> pulls out - we're going to stay here and escape at night. </sentence><sentence id="365">And uh the <span class="spatial object">train</span> started pulling out...for a moment I was hesitating because I tried to stay with my younger, you know, friends, with my own age friends, but he pulled my arm. </sentence><sentence id="366">Stay. </sentence><sentence id="367">And we stayed and the <span class="spatial object">train</span> pulled out. </sentence><sentence id="368">We, of course, left the place right away and we went in to the <span class="region">countryside</span>. </sentence><sentence id="369">Yeah, sure. </sentence><sentence id="370">And we took, of course, the bands off but we still didn't look like Hungarian farmers, so uh, you know, you were not a hundred percent safe. </sentence><sentence id="371">Anyway, we went to the <span class="region">country side</span> and we went off the <span class="dlf">road</span>, off the <span class="dlf">highway</span> because the <span class="dlf">highway</span> was dangerous because, you know, the the German troops...they were already retreating and the Hungarians, but they were going on the <span class="dlf">highways</span>. </sentence><sentence id="372">And besides uh <span class="spatial object">Russian planes</span> were coming and bombing the <span class="dlf">highways</span>, so we went off the <span class="dlf">road</span> and uh we were hiding somewhere, you know, in the <span class="env feature">grass</span> and I remember, at one time they said these troops, the Hungarian troops...they stopped on the <span class="dlf">highway</span> and the Hungarian...some of the soldiers were coming towards us because we were near a little <span class="env feature">lake</span> or something, and they were coming closer and closer. </sentence><sentence id="373">So my friend said now let's act very normally and calm, because uh...and they came, they saw us and they said uh, what what are you guys doing here. </sentence><sentence id="374">I said we missed our <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="375">We sold them a bill, bill of goods, you know, and they believed it, fortunately. </sentence><sentence id="376">So later on at night when the sun went down we saw a Romanian...there was a a part of <span class="country">Romania</span> see at that time...we saw a Romanian farmer and we called him closer and said uh please...we didn't speak Romanian but he understood...and says, you know, try to hide us. </sentence><sentence id="377">We have to uh get away, and he did take us in, fortunately. </sentence><sentence id="378">We were lucky. </sentence><sentence id="379">He took us in and we were hiding in his little <span class="dlf">farm</span> there for about uh three days. </sentence><sentence id="380">He was feeding us ___OK and we heard the Russians, you know, the <span class="spatial object">cannons</span>, getting closer and closer and uh he says when when...today...tomorrow, you know...and he told us that the Russians are celebrating a few miles away, but they're not coming yet. </sentence><sentence id="381">They're still not here, so he can't let us loose see. </sentence><sentence id="382">And oh I think next morning he comes up. </sentence><sentence id="383">He says the Russian and the Romanian soldiers are here so we are safe. </sentence><sentence id="384">It's OK. </sentence><sentence id="385">So we came down from our hiding place and the first thing, the first Romanian soldier I met took my watch, took my shoes, which were not too good but obviously looked better than his...oh yes...you know...we figured liberated, you know, they're going to put their arms around us...anyway, but we were free. </sentence><sentence id="386">We knew we were free. </sentence><sentence id="387">So then we started walking back to his <span class="populated place">hometown</span>, which was as I say from there perhaps about eighty, ninety, hundred miles. </sentence><sentence
