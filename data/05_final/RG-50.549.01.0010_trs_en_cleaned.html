<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="133">Q: So when you no longer had to feel that way and had to feel like you had to hide who you were, did that open something in you? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="195">A: Actually I was no longer Kleinfeldt(ph) during the war, they changed my name to disguise the Jewishness, so I had some other name, Alshevska(ph), it was the name of the <span class="populated place">village</span>, so they gave it to me, so I was no longer Kleinfeldt(ph) any way, I was Alshevska(ph), just any name. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="197">Q: So when you were a kid and at that point when you didn't have to hide any more, what was your identity, who did you think you were, who were you for you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="199">A: This was difficult, but I don't think I had time, or thought much about it, I mean, with the first family, my only occupation was to keep alive and somehow withstand the abuse. </sentence><sentence id="200">With this family I wanted to be helpful, so I was either working, doing something with them, and then I started going to <span class="building">school</span>, so my life was pretty busy. </sentence><sentence id="201">I don't think I thought much about This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="202">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="203"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Edwarda Rorat 10 February 25, 1996 Page 10 my identity or anything and most likely I tried to block my past, most likely because I did realize sometime later on, that I eliminated my parents entirely, so most likely I also try not to think of anything much. </sentence><sentence id="204">I don't know what a child does. </sentence><sentence id="205">Maybe this is survival methods. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="213">Q: Did you identify with being Jewish? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="215">A: Well the people reminded me of this every moment of my life. </sentence><sentence id="216">Not only that I'm Jewish, but that I'm scabby Jewish, it doesn't translate exactly into English, does it? </sentence><sentence id="217">Scabby, lousy, rotten, dirty Jew, all those things. </sentence><sentence id="218">So yes, I did know I was different, I was Jewish. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="223">Q: So at the point that you didn't have to hide this any more, was that at least a feeling for you of, like the equivalent of coming out, of saying okay, yes I'm a Jew and yes that's fine. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="225">A: No, I never thought was fine, because nobody else thought it was fine and I did not think it was fine. </sentence><sentence id="226">I actually felt very inferior, very ugly, very inferior. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="229">Q: You were saying that there were efforts made after the war, on different Jewish organizations, what was going on that you were aware of? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="231">A: Well, I had my sister, not with me, but she was already with Jewish people in <span class="populated place">Lublin</span>, which is the bigger <span class="populated place">city</span> and she wrote me that we have an opportunity to leave <span class="country">Poland</span> and possibly go to <span class="country">United States</span>, but I was separated with my sister, we were not close and now her asking me to join her wasn't, it wasn't, I don't know, it didn't mean as much to me as being with this woman who was taking care of me. </sentence><sentence id="232">I didn't want to hurt her feelings and somehow I was not very much concerned with my sister. </sentence><sentence id="233">I knew that she will do all right, she was older than I, stronger and everything and maybe their methods were not the best, the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="234">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="235"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Edwarda Rorat 11 February 25, 1996 Page 11 people who came to the <span class="populated place">village</span> to talk me into leaving the <span class="populated place">village</span>, leaving my adoptive parents. </sentence><sentence id="236">They didn't talk to me, I mean, they tried to kidnap me because they knew I don't want to leave, so they either tried to kidnap, or if they contacted me they were saying the worst things about the villagers, so that didn't play with me, so no, so that's why I didn't go. </sentence><sentence id="237">I didn't leave them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="246">Q: How long did you stay in the <span class="populated place">village</span> with them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="248">A: I mean, in their <span class="building">house</span> 13, 14, but later there were no more <span class="building">schools</span>, even to that age, I have to walk several miles to <span class="building">school</span>, there was no <span class="building">school</span> in that little place, but at 14 there was not even enough <span class="building">school</span> in the next, I don't know how you call it, next <span class="populated place">village</span> and so I had to go to <span class="populated place">Lublin</span> and then I them very early, so that I was with them  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Edwarda Rorat 12 February 25, 1996 Page 12 was the only Jewish kid in the <span class="building">class</span> and he hated my guts. </sentence><sentence id="249">He absolutely couldn't stand me. </sentence><sentence id="250">He was a cruel person altogether, he used to beat up the other children. </sentence><sentence id="251">But I was so good in learning, in behaving, in everything, that he'd no excuse to hit me, there was no excuse and he absolutely couldn't stand a Jewess, so he continuously used to just call me something, it was sarcastic, it was unpleasant and eventually he did hit me. </sentence><sentence id="252">And that was the time I could not be hit any more, that was sort of a saturation point in my life. </sentence><sentence id="253">So I came <span class="building">home</span> and I said I will not go to that <span class="building">school</span> again, that's why I had to march several miles to another <span class="building">school</span>, rather than going to this one. </sentence><sentence id="254">So it was pretty difficult for a few years old child to go through <span class="building">school</span> and <span class="env feature">forest</span>, not a single person there. </sentence><sentence id="255">I had to leave early, before sunrise, I mean it was dark and go by myself. </sentence><sentence id="256">There were wild animals around and walk, so I wasn't easy. </sentence><sentence id="257">And then after <span class="building">school</span>, the same thing, walking several miles by myself, but the good thought was that studying always came very easy to me compared to the other children that it did feel good to be a good student and my adoptive parents were very proud of me. </sentence><sentence id="258">But that again, it really, nothing was ever simple. </sentence><sentence id="259">When I was too good there, the children were jealous and they also could call me, oh she's so good because she's Jewish and almost being the best student was almost like an insult that that's because Jews, you know, they are so manipulative and so shrewd and whatever. </sentence><sentence id="260">They turn it in . </sentence><sentence id="261">The teachers like me, but  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Edwarda Rorat 13 February 25, 1996 Page 13 they felt I have to be educated. </sentence><sentence id="262">They believe in that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="282">Q: What about the parents of the other children, was there any resentment by them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="284">A: I really don't know. </sentence><sentence id="285">The other children had hard time learning. </sentence><sentence id="286">I suppose because of my background I had it easier, my parents were educated and that probably was in my genes. </sentence><sentence id="287">So I had it real easy, I was delayed with my schooling because of the war and the way I was catching up, I was practically flying through those <span class="spatial object">classes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="288">So that's why I could finish really on time, otherwise it wouldn't have been possible. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="294">Q: I want you to help me get a picture, and actual, so I can make a little movie </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="308">Q: Sounds like a really nice part of your day. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="310">A: That was after the war of course, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="312">Q: And then you would get to the <span class="building">school</span>, what did the <span class="building">school</span> look like, was it a wooden <span class="building">building</span> or what? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="314">A: Yeah, the <span class="building">school</span>, when I walked several miles to this other place, this was already better place than my <span class="building">school</span> in my <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="315">It was a small <span class="interior space">room</span>, nothing really special. </sentence><sentence id="316">I particularly like classes of religion. </sentence><sentence id="317">The priest was giving them and he was teaching of all those miracles that happen in Catholic religion. </sentence><sentence id="318">Of course I was educated and brought up actually in Catholic experience, so I was learning this. </sentence><sentence id="319">Of all the miracles that happen in Catholicism and I suppose this was pleasant to me. </sentence><sentence id="320">Maybe I thought that miracles will happen to me too, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="321">And I was reading all the books on the subject. </sentence><sentence id="322">So actually this is my most pleasant thought, the priest. </sentence><sentence id="323">He was not anti-Semitic, at least didn't let me feel it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="334">Q: Did you feel any conflict between, being brought up as a Jew that you were not to This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="335">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="336"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Edwarda Rorat 15 February 25, 1996 Page 15 worship idols in Catholicism with it's love of idols? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="340">A: A conflict within myself? </sentence><sentence id="341">No, I was very curious to learn this Catholic religion, it was very soothing to me, I like the miracles and as I told to you, I eliminated the thought of my parents from my mind and I did not remember if my parents were religious or not, I don't remember any of that. </sentence><sentence id="342">So I was trying to learn what I was taught. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="346">Q: Did you pray for a miracle? </sentence></p></dialogue>
