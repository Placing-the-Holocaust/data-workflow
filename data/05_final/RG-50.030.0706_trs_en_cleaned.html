</sentence><sentence id="3580">Because it turned out that <span class="region">New York state</span>, there are unclaimed insurance policies, monies which were left around in <span class="building">banks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3581">In the bill -- b -- in the billions. </sentence><sentence id="3582">And the story was that <span class="populated place">New York state</span> can get this if it stays unclaimed, because there is a law, if you don't claim X after so many years, it becomes the property of the state. </sentence><sentence id="3583">So naturally, <span class="region">New York state</span>, I can imagine if they could get a couple of million, perhaps billion, oh my gosh, you know?
