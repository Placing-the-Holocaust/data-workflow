<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A:Yes. </sentence><sentence id="6">My name is Stanislaw Soszynski. </sentence><sentence id="7">I was born on February 24, 1931, in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="8">I lived in <span class="populated place">Old Town</span> through my whole childhood. </sentence><sentence id="9">This is the oldest part of <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>, mostly inhabited by the poor, craftsmen, merchants. </sentence><sentence id="10">A very diverse population, forming the <span class="region">northern part</span> of <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="11">The <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span> was inhabited by many, even very many, Jewish families. </sentence><sentence id="12">In our <span class="building">building</span>, at 11 <span class="dlf">Fret Street</span>, there lived five Jewish families, out of twenty-odd total in the <span class="building">building</span>. </sentence><sentence id="13">Our relations were those of neighbors, that is <span class="building">apartments</span> were not locked, theft was unknown. </sentence><sentence id="14">Nowadays the full symbiosis that existed in those crowded, packed <span class="building">buildings</span> is forgotten. </sentence><sentence id="15">There were of course disturbances in this symbiosis. </sentence><sentence id="16">There had to be. </sentence><sentence id="17">Whenever people are crowded into a <span class="interior space">mall space</span>, the conflicts of their interests lead to occasional strife. </sentence><sentence id="18">That peaceful life, that life of storekeepers, tradesmen, craftsmen, minor civil servants, was interrupted by the war. </sentence><sentence id="19">There was an immense <span class="building">market hall</span> near the <span class="dlf">street</span> that I lived on. </sentence><sentence id="20">It was on <span class="dlf">Swietojerska Street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="21">It was split in half, and fish were sold on one side, while vegetables, fruits, and dairy products were sold on the other. </sentence><sentence id="22">That <span class="building">market hall</span> will be very important to the lives of many people during the war. </sentence><sentence id="23">Firstly, food will be sent through it, for it stood on the <span class="dlf">line</span> that was designated by the Germans as the <span class="dlf">border</span> of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="24">Later, in the years of the defense of <span class="populated place">Old Town</span>, that <span class="interior space">hall</span> will be transformed into a huge <span class="building">hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="25">Although it is impossible to change a <span class="building">fish market</span> or a <span class="building">produce market</span> into a <span class="building">hospital</span>, that was how it was, regardless. </sentence><sentence id="26">The siege of <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> in 1939 was a great drama. </sentence><sentence id="27">The Germans, having broken the resistance of the Polish army west of the <span class="dlf">Vistula</span>, surrounded <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="28">The <span class="populated place">city</span> was full of historic architectural artifacts and <span class="spatial object">monuments</span>. </sentence><sentence id="29">Almost 700 antique <span class="building">buildings</span> were so ravaged by the war that they had to be built practically all over again. </sentence><sentence id="30">Besides, the 1.5 million enclosed people of the <span class="populated place">city</span> defended itself desperately, led by President Stefan Starzynski. </sentence><sentence id="31">The defenders consisted partly of members of the Jewish population. </sentence><sentence id="32">President Starzynski, the defender of <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> in 1939, appointed Czerniakow as his co-worker representing the Jewish population, the Jewish society. </sentence><sentence id="33">When the Germans entered <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>, a demolished <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> covered in snow, in which the <span class="dlf">walls</span> smelled scorched. </sentence><sentence id="34">I lived through one of the most difficult times in my life. </sentence><sentence id="35">We were going on <span class="dlf">Wierzbowa Street</span> to Marshall Jozef Pilsudski Square to visit my aunt, passing the burned <span class="building">buildings</span> of <span class="dlf">Theater Square</span>, when on the other side of the <span class="dlf">street</span> I saw a man who appeared to be drunk. </sentence><sentence id="36">I was with my father and my siblings. </sentence><sentence id="37">He was stumbling from the sides of the <span class="building">houses</span> to the <span class="dlf">curb</span> and weaving across the width of the <span class="dlf">sidewalk</span>. </sentence><sentence id="38">At last he fell down. </sentence><sentence id="39">Father said that we should keep going down the side of the <span class="dlf">street</span> that we were on, but he crossed the <span class="dlf">street</span> and approached the man. </sentence><sentence id="40">He picked him up, and now others came up. </sentence><sentence id="41">Together they sat him on a <span class="dlf">wall</span>. </sentence><sentence id="42">I saw that my father lifted up the man's trouser leg and bound the man's leg with his handkerchief. </sentence><sentence id="43">He kept going down the <span class="dlf">street</span>, parallel to us. </sentence><sentence id="44">When we came out onto the <span class="dlf">square</span>, I noticed that Z-shaped <span class="dlf">anti-aircraft ditches</span> had been dug into the <span class="env feature">grass</span> of the <span class="dlf">square</span>. </sentence><sentence id="45">There were some people filling them in while a German sentry watched over them. </sentence><sentence id="46">The soldier wore a helmet and carried a carbine with an affixed bayonet. </sentence><sentence id="47">Father went up to him and looked at him. </sentence><sentence id="48">He came back This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="49">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="50"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection and said "That thug ran his bayonet through that man's leg." </sentence><sentence id="51">I could not understand how someone could simply bayonet someone's leg like that, on the <span class="dlf">street</span> in broad daylight, simply because he was not filling a <span class="dlf">ditch</span> fast enough, or, as it later turned out, because he was a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="52">It was an inexplicable situation, but I realized then that a time had come when law went against common sense... these are complex matters, I cannot explain, but I realized that invaders, Germans, bad people had come. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="103">Q:You were eight years old then. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="105">A:I was then eight years old, yes. </sentence><sentence id="106">A common life of poverty commenced. </sentence><sentence id="107">The <span class="populated place">city</span> was destroyed, there was no running water, no light, no food. </sentence><sentence id="108">Water was carried from the <span class="env feature">river</span>. </sentence><sentence id="109">Because women did the laundry in their <span class="building">homes</span>, every <span class="building">home</span> had a big <span class="spatial object">kettle</span> for doing the wash. </sentence><sentence id="110">The men stood in a <span class="dlf">row</span> and together took all of the <span class="spatial object">pots</span>. </sentence><sentence id="111">They went in long strings to the <span class="dlf">Vistula</span>, taking <span class="dlf">streets</span> that sloped down to the <span class="env feature">river</span>. </sentence><sentence id="112">They nailed together <span class="spatial object">boards</span> and put them over the <span class="env feature">water</span> they collected so that it would not splash out. </sentence><sentence id="113">These problems cemented people all the more; nothing unites like misfortune. </sentence><sentence id="114">Joy may split, while misery draws people together. </sentence><sentence id="115">This is the second scene that I remember, and it also is as if from a ghastly dream. </sentence><sentence id="116">German patrols began appearing in our <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span> dressed in what were known before the war as anti- [102] suits. </sentence><sentence id="117">They were made out of a watertight, prepared fabric. </sentence><sentence id="118">On their backs they carried <span class="spatial object">tanks</span> and in their hands they had nozzles such as are today used to apply lacquer under pressure. </sentence><sentence id="119">There was some kind of poison in those <span class="spatial object">tanks</span>, phenol or carbolic acid or some other liquid that destroyed everything that it came into contact with. </sentence><sentence id="120">It turned out that these patrols demanded money from owners of <span class="building">Jewish stores</span>. </sentence><sentence id="121">If the extortion money was not paid, the Germans would hose down the inside of the <span class="building">store</span> with the carbolic acid. </sentence><sentence id="122">There was a <span class="building">jeweler</span> in the next <span class="building">building</span> to us. </sentence><sentence id="123">He had a tiny <span class="building">store</span>, so small that the <span class="dlf">door</span> simultaneously served as the display. </sentence><sentence id="124">There was a <span class="spatial object">counter</span> inside, while the precious things he put on display were hung on an ingenious little <span class="spatial object">shelf</span> in the <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="125">I stood before the <span class="dlf">door</span> when the Germans came up and demanded payment - he did not have it. </sentence><sentence id="126">Within a few minutes, the <span class="building">store</span> had been soaked with that stinking carbolic acid. </sentence><sentence id="127">To this day, I get a feeling of grimness whenever I enter a newly disinfected <span class="interior space">room</span>, because I see a man with that destructive nozzle in his hand. </sentence><sentence id="128">There was no talk of a <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> at the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="129">At first it was even said that the Jews would be in a better situation than the Poles under the occupation because they would be able to understand what the Germans were saying. </sentence><sentence id="130">The lion's share of the Jewish people understood German. </sentence><sentence id="131">This turned out to be an illusion. </sentence><sentence id="132">The winter of 1939-1940 was bitterly cold. </sentence><sentence id="133">The frost was so strong that it split open <span class="env feature">trees</span>. </sentence><sentence id="134">On <span class="dlf">New Town Square</span>, there stood a dozen <span class="env feature">trees</span> at the base of which was a temporary <span class="dlf">cemetery</span>. </sentence><sentence id="135">In the middle stood a statue of the patron of <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>, and the <span class="env feature">trees</span> broke up so that limbs were falling down on the <span class="dlf">graves</span>. </sentence><sentence id="136">During that winter I wore my scarf, earmuffs, a fur hat. </sentence><sentence id="137">I was standing in the <span class="dlf">gate</span> when one of my friends ran out bare-headed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="171">Q:One of your Jewish friends? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="173">A:Yes, one of my Jewish friends. </sentence><sentence id="174">I motioned to him with my chin, to ask "Hey, have you gone crazy? </sentence><sentence id="175">You should put something on your head." </sentence><sentence id="176">He motioned with his head at a German This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="177">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="178"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection patrol standing at a narrowing in the <span class="dlf">street</span> to which all the passing Jews had to bow. </sentence><sentence id="179">He did not have a cap so that he would not have to bow, in that horrible cold. </sentence><sentence id="180">I looked at him, he was three or four years older than me, and I felt the strangeness of the situation. </sentence><sentence id="181">Then talk began that there would be a <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, that all the nationalities in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> would be put into their own <span class="region">zones</span>. </sentence><sentence id="182">No one said that there would be a <span class="interior space">Jewish section</span>, an <span class="building">extermination section</span>. </sentence><sentence id="183">I think that the precision with which that society was destroyed was the result of great thought - psychological thought, organizational thought. </sentence><sentence id="184">I think that it must have been done by people who knew mob psychology. </sentence><sentence id="185">It is not so simple to collect three or four hundred thousand people in one place without telling them about one's goal, one's purpose. </sentence><sentence id="186">The first step was simply lying: that is, it was said that <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> would be split into sections. </sentence><sentence id="187">There would be an assigned <span class="dlf">Aryan section</span>, a <span class="dlf">German section</span>, a Jewish section. </sentence><sentence id="188">The <span class="dlf">Jewish section</span> was relatively speaking huge, very large in this first phase. </sentence><sentence id="189">These <span class="region">sections</span> were to be inhabited exclusively by those assigned to them. </sentence><sentence id="190">The psychological groundwork for this division was laid by posting on <span class="spatial object">streetcar posts</span> and <span class="spatial object">street lanterns</span> signs that said "Jews Are Forbidden To Walk On This Side Of The <span class="dlf">Street</span>." </sentence><sentence id="191">Suddenly, a part of the <span class="dlf">street</span> was off-limits, like <span class="building">stores</span>, like <span class="dlf">parks</span>, and similar places in the <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="192">Another form of preparation was that the Germans placed signs on the <span class="dlf">roads</span> that instructed drivers to drive past very quickly because the <span class="region">area</span> was infected with typhus. </sentence><sentence id="193">Finally, small <span class="dlf">walls</span> sprang up. </sentence><sentence id="194">The people of <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>, especially the people of <span class="populated place">Old Town</span>, the oldest <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span>, were hot-headed, and if <span class="dlf">walls</span> were put up against their will, then they took them down. </sentence><sentence id="195">At first those <span class="dlf">walls</span> were taken part. </sentence><sentence id="196">Someone needed some bricks, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="197">It turned out that this was another ploy: it was said that the <span class="dlf">walls</span> would form <span class="dlf">checkpoints</span> where the police could check passer-by's identification, but in reality it was announced that the <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span> was closed, and that people who were forced to wear armbands with the Star of David had to go there. </sentence><sentence id="198">Tens of thousands of people living in that <span class="region">zone</span> had to be moved, however. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="227">Q:Your <span class="building">house</span> was not in the <span class="region">zone</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="229">A:Our <span class="building">house</span> was on the <span class="dlf">border</span> of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="231">Q:So it was still on the <span class="region">Aryan side</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="233">A:The back of the <span class="building">house</span> was in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="234">But our part, the front of the <span class="building">house</span>, where our <span class="interior space">apartment</span> was, was on the <span class="region">Aryan side</span>. </sentence><sentence id="235">This later led to an unexpected result: the great smuggling operation that began when the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was closed. </sentence><sentence id="236">For example, people would pour milk down the <span class="dlf">drain-pipes</span> to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> part. </sentence><sentence id="237">But now I am speaking about the point when tens of thousands of people were leaving the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and tens of thousands were moving in. </sentence><sentence id="238">Because time was very short, the people who had property there had to quickly sell everything in an effort to save something. </sentence><sentence id="239">Those people were pauperized. </sentence><sentence id="240">So a great <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was created, containing 300,000 people. </sentence><sentence id="241">Today, when one looks at a map and knows the outcome of it all, one can see that the <span class="dlf">line</span> of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was very carefully drawn so as to leave all large <span class="dlf">parks</span> outside. </sentence><sentence id="242">No large <span class="region">area</span> of <span class="env feature">greenery</span>, no <span class="dlf">square</span> that could give some respite to the children there, not to mention the adults. </sentence><sentence id="243">One of the surprising, shocking facts that I have learned is the story of the teacher in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> who asked the children to draw summer. </sentence><sentence id="244">It turned out that the children did not know what it This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="245">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="246"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection looks like. </sentence><sentence id="247">Four and five year-old children who had grown up behind the <span class="dlf">walls</span> could not; draw a horse, cows, sheep they did not even know what those things were. </sentence><sentence id="248">Families left our <span class="building">house</span> in tears. </sentence><sentence id="249">Superintendent Bomoski [ph -220], a simple man, helped them load what they had - they were not rich people. </sentence><sentence id="250">In any case, we said that sooner or later the war would end, that we would surely see each other again. </sentence><sentence id="251">Unfortunately this was not to be. </sentence><sentence id="252">Those <span class="dlf">walls</span> were the battle-ground of a contest between the leadership of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, the people of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, and the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="253">Because by means of those <span class="dlf">walls</span>, attention was turned away from the basic facts. </sentence><sentence id="254">If one day it was announced that <span class="populated place">Zlota</span>, <span class="populated place">Hoza</span>, or <span class="populated place">Sienna</span>, or a part of a <span class="building">building</span> was no longer in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> or else was now included in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, it seemed as if directing energies toward "defense" was the most important thing. </sentence><sentence id="255">In reality, this was not the case. </sentence><sentence id="256">Hunger began there. </sentence><sentence id="257">Rations were purposely reduced so that hunger began. </sentence><sentence id="258">Small boys who could get through the <span class="dlf">holes</span> knocked in the <span class="dlf">walls</span> of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> went through. </sentence><sentence id="259">Among others, two boys from our <span class="building">building</span> came. </sentence><sentence id="260">They sat on a <span class="dlf">stump</span>. </sentence><sentence id="261">All of the <span class="building">houses</span> in that old part of <span class="populated place">town</span>, since the only heat was from <span class="spatial object">coal stoves</span>, had large stumps in the <span class="interior space">courtyard</span> for chopping wood. </sentence><sentence id="262">They sat on that <span class="dlf">stump</span>, we all ran up. </sentence><sentence id="263">They sad that it was hard, that some of their parents were in poor health, that they came because they had nowhere to go and they knew they had friends here, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="264">The adults gave them, I had nothing of course, what they had, some pieces of bacon, bags of flour. </sentence><sentence id="265">I made an appointment to see them. </sentence><sentence id="266">Because the <span class="spatial object">streetcar</span> went through the <span class="dlf">streets</span> of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> to <span class="populated place">Powzazki</span>, there was no other way for the <span class="spatial object">streetcar</span> to go, one could board on the <span class="region">Aryan side</span> and ride through. </sentence><sentence id="267">Although a policeman guarded the <span class="spatial object">car</span>, it was possible to jump out, at first, when the <span class="spatial object">streetcar</span> still operated as it did before the war. </sentence><sentence id="268">I suddenly found myself in a <span class="populated place">city</span> that is hard to imagine. </sentence><sentence id="269">Thousands of people walked back and forth, apparently with no purpose. </sentence><sentence id="270">Peddlers ran around with their <span class="spatial object">carts</span>. </sentence><sentence id="271">Someone was selling bread, which he kept in a <span class="spatial object">basket</span> made of <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span>, so that no one could take it without paying. </sentence><sentence id="272">All of this was so unbelievable that even now that I am an adult, an old man, an artist, whenever I try to represent it graphically I look at my work and think that it is complete]y surrealistic. </sentence><sentence id="273">Bread bundled in <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span> is inedible. </sentence><sentence id="274">One cannot even begin to share those peoples experience. </sentence><sentence id="275">I found the boys: it turned out that they lived with ten other people in one <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="276">Sanitary problems began immediately. </sentence><sentence id="277">Today, in a world in which everything works without disruption, we do not understand what it means, twelve people in one <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="278">Not in one <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, in one <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="279">Now, suddenly that one small <span class="interior space">water closet</span> intended for the use of a family of four or five must function as a <span class="interior space">street lavatory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="280">An unbelievable thing started to happen. </sentence><sentence id="281">I cannot talk about people dying. </sentence><sentence id="282">I know it now, but I did not see it then. </sentence><sentence id="283">But there were dead bodies laying on the <span class="dlf">sidewalks</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="337">Q:In the <span class="dlf">street</span> or on the side? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="339">A:Everywhere! </sentence><sentence id="340">Today it is known that; on <span class="dlf">Krochmalna Street</span> there was a <span class="building">building</span> in which, out of four hundred inhabitants, four hundred died! </sentence><sentence id="341">A whole <span class="building">apartment building</span> died, a huge <span class="building">apartment building</span> with four hundred people. </sentence><sentence id="342">After some time, the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was sealed off completely. </sentence><sentence id="343">One could not go in without a special pass, and even with a pass... the story went around <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> that a Polish doctor, on the

</sentence><sentence id="352">Of course. </sentence><sentence id="353">Today, after the war, the names of those people have been established, and it is known that it was done with all of the perfidy of the consequences that such a form of extermination carries with it. </sentence><sentence id="354">Because the <span class="dlf">walls</span> of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> moved as those people were crowded even more, and we lived close by, I had an experience that I already told you about that is I sold milk. </sentence><sentence id="355">This was necessary because my father fell ill and could no longer support the <span class="building">household</span>. </sentence><sentence id="356">There were three of us then, my mother. </sentence><sentence id="357">I was twelve years old then. </sentence><sentence id="358">I took a milk can and went outside of <span class="populated place">town</span> to a farmer who would sell me twelve liters. </sentence><sentence id="359">I was scared while transporting it, because the so-called "sentries" stood guard at all of the <span class="building">train stations</span>. </sentence><sentence id="360">This was often quite dramatic: a German gendarme called "Pretty Boy, " because he had a very pretty appearance, an ideally smooth face, clean-shaven, a pretty boy, came into the <span class="interior space">compartment</span> and started looking for contraband. </sentence><sentence id="361">Meat, butter, whatever made him happy. </sentence><sentence id="362">I was sitting on my <span class="spatial object">milk can</span> between the <span class="spatial object">seats</span> next to the <span class="dlf">window</span>. </sentence><sentence id="363">There was another milk can up on the <span class="spatial object">luggage rack</span>, which its owner, another man, had opened so that it would not go sour. </sentence><sentence id="364">The German seized the <span class="spatial object">can</span> by the

Germans put up signs saying that they would shoot without warning at anyone found in that <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="494">It turned out that this was all part of their

of the <span class="populated place">city</span> was to be leveled with the <span class="env feature">ground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="496">No one knew that then except for people like Professor Zachwatowicz, who was able to get to the documents dealing with Pabst in the <span class="building">town hall</span>. </sentence><sentence id="497">Now, filled with horror and surprise, we watched as a great <span class="populated place">city</span> of a million and a half people and covering several square kilometers was turned to <span class="env feature">desert</span>, completely leveled. </sentence><sentence id="498">Everything of any value was taken out: pipes, <span class="interior space">balconies</span>, <span class="dlf">roofing</span>, upholstery, and so on, and then the <span class="building">buildings</span> were blown up. </sentence><sentence id="499">The <span class="building">houses</span> were mined and blown up. </sentence><sentence id="500">In 1944, when

to 45. </sentence><sentence id="505">If one goes to that part of <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> today, one can still see how it was. </sentence><sentence id="506">Every time a <span

up. </sentence><sentence id="507">I wanted to understand why it happened, why those people were destroyed, why that <span class="populated place">city</span> was destroyed. </sentence><sentence id="508">I looked for some sort of memory of those people. </sentence><sentence id="509">I dug up the strangest things there. </sentence><sentence id="510">Some of them I could not pick up, or, feeling their gravity, I decided that I had no place worthy to hold them. </sentence><sentence id="511">For example, once a <span class="spatial object">bulldozer</span> pushed aside a huge block of bricks, under which lay several hundred trouser and vest buckles, which evidently had been in a bag or a <span class="spatial object">box</span> that had decayed. </sentence><sentence id="512">Oxidized buckles. </sentence><sentence id="513">Because they had been there, crushed, for a long time, they had formed a cluster, a <span class="spatial object">sculpture</span>. </sentence><sentence id="514">I looked at it and thought that this was a kind of summation of what had happened there. </sentence><sentence id="515">There must have been a sickly tailor there who was suddenly told that he had to leave everything. </sentence><sentence id="516">Of course, the buckles were the most important thing to him, because that was his <span class="building">shop</span>. </sentence><sentence id="517">He hid them down there in the <span class="interior space">basement</span>. </sentence><sentence id="518">They took his live away, and the buckles lay there. </sentence><sentence id="519">An <span class="spatial object">object</span>, a tiny <span class="spatial object">object</span>, can say more about a drama like this than a hundred words. </sentence><sentence id="520">That flat <span class="env feature">plain</span> was petrifying to the <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="521">It made it clear that life is stronger than that... that... demonic destruction. </sentence><sentence id="522">That was not human destruction, it was somehow devilish. </sentence><sentence id="523">The knowledge that someday this would all be grown over, <span class="env feature">trees</span> would sprout, <span class="populated place">neighborhoods</span>, children who did not even know what had happened would be playing, it would be another <span class="populated place">city</span> for them. </sentence><sentence id="524">I tried to remember and cement in my memory what had happened from this angle and I collected fragments of that <span class="populated place">city</span> and of that life. </sentence><sentence id="525">Sometimes the images I saw wandering in the <span class="dlf">ruins</span> were surrealistic. </sentence><sentence id="526">I think that I have told about this already. </sentence><sentence id="527">I once saw that <span class="spatial object">bricks</span> were flying into the <span class="env feature">air</span> on that flat <span class="env feature">plain</span>. </sentence><sentence id="528">They would jump up. </sentence><sentence id="529">A <span class="spatial object">brick</span> would leap into the <span class="env feature">air</span> and fall down again. </sentence><sentence id="530">There were whole <span class="dlf">fields</span> of jumping bricks. </sentence><sentence id="531">I could not understand, I thought that I was starting to see things, for how do bricks jump? </sentence><sentence id="532">But I put aside my concern and went closer to where the bricks were flying. </sentence><sentence id="533">I now saw with great surprise that that Teutonic fury had destroyed everything on the surface, but that down below the fundament remained, and they contained good, healthy brick. </sentence><sentence id="534">So the local carters earned money by clinging <span class="dlf">holes</span> down to the <span class="dlf">fundament</span>, throwing the bricks up to the surface, and selling them to people who were <span class="building">building</span>. </sentence><sentence id="535">It was very simple and logical, there was nothing extraordinary about it. </sentence><sentence id="536">All the same, that was how life began to creep back into that <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="537">Spontaneously, in the general rebuilding of <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>, it began by taking out the bricks, restoring order. </sentence><sentence id="538">The bricks were put in piles, the <span class="region">area</span> was cleaned, the <span class="populated place">Muranow residential district</span> was built, partly on <span class="region">land</span> that had been part of the <span class="populated place">Jewish section</span>. </sentence><sentence id="539">The <span class="populated place">city</span> began to expand as far as the <span class="dlf">cemeteries</span> that are still there today. </sentence><sentence id="540">It turned out that this was a kind of <span class="populated place">holy place</span>. </sentence><sentence id="541">Today it is very difficult to

<span class="env feature">earth</span> to build a fundament brings up human bones, <span class="dlf">mass graves</span> are found in completely unexpected places. </sentence><sentence id="543">Every

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="611">A:That is because I did not know that: it was a subject of our conversation. </sentence><sentence id="612">A year after the events in the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span>, <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> rose to do battle. </sentence><sentence id="613">As it turned out, that what they had done in one <span class="populated place">district</span>, they now expanded onto a scale of the whole <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="614">My beloved <span class="populated place">Old Town</span>, in which I grew up, and which was the place on <span class="country">earth</span> to which I belonged, as everyone should have such a place, was leveled just as the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was. </sentence><sentence id="615">It is very hard to understand the words "Your <span class="building">house</span> has burned down." </sentence><sentence id="616">They are only five words, but it is very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="617">When we went out, it was also very surrealistic. </sentence><sentence id="618">I kept fish. </sentence><sentence id="619">I always liked animals, birds, <span class="env feature">plants</span>. </sentence><sentence id="620">I made myself an <span class="spatial object">aquarium</span> and kept fish. </sentence><sentence id="621">I had already had one sad experience: <span class="dlf">windows</span> had to be completely blacked-out, so that no light at all got out, and it was winter. </sentence><sentence id="622">Upon opening the <span class="dlf">curtain</span> one morning, I saw that the <span class="spatial object">aquarium</span> had frozen. </sentence><sentence id="623">It was so cold in the <span class="interior space">apartment</span> that those poor fish were frozen still in the <span class="env feature">ice</span>. </sentence><sentence id="624">It is now September 2, 1944, the end of the defense of <span class="populated place">Old Town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="625">We are to come out with our hands up. </sentence><sentence id="626">I run into the <span class="interior space">apartment</span> and there is the <span class="spatial object">aquarium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="627">I know that soon there will be a great fire here, and that the <span class="spatial object">aquarium</span> will shatter, and that that little bit of <span class="env feature">water</span> has no chance of putting the fire out. </sentence><sentence id="628">The <span class="interior space">apartment</span> is a place to which one comes back, to which one comes with the feeling that it is a place of respite -
