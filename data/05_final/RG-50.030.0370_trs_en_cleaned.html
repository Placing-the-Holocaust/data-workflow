<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="17">Q:Can you tell me about your early childhood and about your family? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="19">A:My early childhood, let's say, was of course in <span class="country">Holland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="20">I grew up in <span class="country">Holland</span>, went to <span class="building">school</span> in <span class="country">Holland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="21">My father and mother were both German and had their parents still in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="22">We used to visit my grandmother in the summers because my grandmother's <span class="building">home</span> in <span class="populated place">Brieg</span> was a jewel of a <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="23">It was a big <span class="building">house</span> with a beautiful <span class="dlf">garden</span> and a <span class="interior space">tennis court</span> and a <span class="interior space">swimming pool</span> and in...in the twenties my mother's father was a...what do you call it? </sentence><sentence id="24">He was making paper stuff, let's say, like <span class="spatial object">folders</span> and writing. </sentence><sentence id="25">There's a word for it, I forget what it is. </sentence><sentence id="26">Anyway, he made his money in this <span class="building">factory</span>, or <span class="building">firm</span>, in <span class="populated place">Brieg</span> and she had the money. </sentence><sentence id="27"> https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.030*370 2 My father was an intellectual. </sentence><sentence id="28">He had studied medicine and was mainly interested at that point in medicine and pharmacology. </sentence><sentence id="29">He never practiced medicine but was a Pharmacologist Endocrinologist and the interesting thing about this is that in the early twenties he starts in <span class="country">Holland</span> to work for <span class="building">slaughter houses</span> because he wants the hormonal products of horses and cows because they begin the first hormone preparation in his <span class="building">laboratory</span> in <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span>. </sentence><sentence id="30">He was first in <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span> and ended up as the Dean of the <span class="building">University</span> in <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span> in the thirties and forties. </sentence><sentence id="31">Anyway, he... In his <span class="building">laboratory</span> they discovered testosterone. </sentence><sentence id="32">So, he is one of the first hormone researchers and I grew up when you asked me about childhood, that my father would put Ponds Cold Cream on one cheek and another hormone cream on the other cheek to see which one worked better. </sentence><sentence id="33">I think it was the <span class="env feature">Ponds</span>. </sentence><sentence id="34">O.K. Early childhood, what more do you want to know? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="53">Q:Brothers and sisters? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="55">A:Let me just quickly tell you about my mother because my mother was the artist in the family. </sentence><sentence id="56">She sang. </sentence><sentence id="57">She painted. </sentence><sentence id="58">She was a terrific painter and terrific singer also a good looking woman. </sentence><sentence id="59">Titian kind of reddish hair and lousy taste in everything except in art and music. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="65">Q:What do you mean? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="67">A:Lousy taste because she wouldn't throw out a thing and she would buy crap because she was stingy. </sentence><sentence id="68">So, we didn't grow up in a <span class="building">house</span> full of beautiful objects. </sentence><sentence id="69">We grew up with whatever was available. </sentence><sentence id="70">Never had a decent new bought dress in my youth because that's the way they were brought up. </sentence><sentence id="71">You get hand me downs. </sentence><sentence id="72">We were five children. </sentence><sentence id="73">There was an older sister  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.030*370 3 and older brother. </sentence><sentence id="74">Me and my younger sister, so five. </sentence><sentence id="75">I think one of the reasons why I got very orderly and very much into beautiful things, whatever, was a reaction to this kind of wild <span class="building">household</span>. </sentence><sentence id="76">But intellectually I think I owe both my parents the interest in literature, art, medicine, anything. </sentence><sentence id="77">Anything except politics. </sentence><sentence id="78">Politics did not play a role. </sentence><sentence id="79">Religion was a very strange situation because my father and mother were both Jewish racially,but had never, ever been in a <span class="building">synagogue</span>. </sentence><sentence id="80">Even in <span class="country">Germany</span>, so my father was born 1880. </sentence><sentence id="81">My mother was born 1883. </sentence><sentence id="82">I've personally never been in a <span class="building">synagogue</span> except when I travel and if I'm in a group or if I'm in <span class="country">Turkey</span> then the guide goes and shows me a <span class="building">synagogue</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="100">Q:Were you conscious of the background of being Jewish? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="102">A:I was conscious of this background and made more conscious of it by a sheer fluke. </sentence><sentence id="103">The <span class="building">schools</span> in <span class="country">Holland</span> are not like here, private or public. </sentence><sentence id="104">Every <span class="building">school</span> was public. </sentence><sentence id="105">You went to <span class="building">public kindergarten</span>, <span class="building">public lower grade</span>, <span class="building">middle school</span>, whatever and then <span class="building">high school</span> is <span class="building">Gymnasium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="106">To go into a <span class="building">university</span> you had to go at that time into a certain <span class="building">school</span> which prepared you for the <span class="building">university</span>. </sentence><sentence id="107">If you went into a trade, there was another <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="108">But if you had...If you didn't want to go to <span class="building">university</span>, I couldn't make it to the <span class="building">university school</span>, I was too stupid. </sentence><sentence id="109">I jumped from what they call a <span class="building">girl's school</span> into the second class of the <span class="building">Gymnasium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="110">I wasn't all that stupid I was just in protest. </sentence><sentence id="111">What made me very interested in  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.030*370 4 religion, I was 11 or 12 and I had to go, let's say, into the <span class="building">school</span> where you either go to <span class="building">university</span> to stay in a <span class="building">trade school</span> or you could get a girl's education. </sentence><sentence id="112">At that time it was just nothing. </sentence><sentence id="113">And, I was a biker. </sentence><sentence id="114">Like all Dutch kids, you were born on a <span class="spatial object">bike</span> and I biked and I was careless. </sentence><sentence id="115">And they wanted to put me in a certain <span class="building">school</span> which was right around the <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span> because then I wouldn't <span class="spatial object">bike</span> so far and come <span class="building">home</span> with a broken leg or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="116">I got put into that <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="117">It was a so called <span class="building">Hervormd Lyceum</span> which is not only Lutheran but it is the <span class="building">Reformed Lutheran church</span>, so the most Calvinistic sect of the <span class="building">Lutheran church</span> you can be in. </sentence><sentence id="118">That was my <span class="building">school</span>, because it was in the <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span>. </sentence><sentence id="119">Then the <span class="building">school</span> moved out of the <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span> and I was in the <span class="building">school</span> anyway, but there comes my religion. </sentence><sentence id="120">My religious background was <span class="building">Sunday school</span>, Christian. </sentence><sentence id="121">It was prayer every morning and so and so on. </sentence><sentence id="122">And it had some Jewish children. </sentence><sentence id="123">I wonder whether they were there because it was the <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span>. </sentence><sentence id="124">I think they were there because it was a very good <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="125">And so, this is where the Christian background comes from. </sentence><sentence id="126">The other thing, there is a habit in my family which is very German that came Christmas around, number one we had a <span class="env feature">tree</span>. </sentence><sentence id="127">Number two the kids were supposed to recite the Christmas story under the <span class="spatial object">Christmas tree</span>. </sentence><sentence id="128">The oldest kid first and by the time it reached me and my sister, it must have been close to the middle 30s, Hitler was there already because I was born in "19. </sentence><sentence id="129">So this was the Christian background. </sentence><sentence id="130">Jews were never mentioned except after "33."33 the first immigrants came from <span class="country">Germany</span> fleeing Hitler and my father immediately got into <span class="building">committees</span>, helped and was on <span class="building">refugees committees</span>. </sentence><sentence id="131">We had refugees all over the place, and we were aware of it, how lucky we were that we did not grow up in <span class="country">Germany</span> but in <span class="country">Holland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="132">I had also problems in <span class="building">school</span> because they knew  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.030*370 5 that my parents were Germans and the Dutch kids hated Germans. </sentence><sentence id="133">They had nicknames for them like in <span class="country">France</span> the Bosches and we called them the <span class="building">Moffen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="134">I was always the child of a moff father, which was a German father. </sentence><sentence id="135">The problem was that he was a professor, that he lectured at the <span class="building">University</span> and that he was so ungifted with language that he never learned decent Dutch so that the students finally said, "Professor Laqueur do us a favor, talk in German because we can't understand you." </sentence><sentence id="136">So, he lectured in German, but wrote in German, English, whatever they wrote in at the time. </sentence><sentence id="137">I think they all still wrote in German. </sentence><sentence id="138">Nobody wrote in English, in medical text. </sentence><sentence id="139">Dutch, you didn't write because nobody could read it, but they wrote German. </sentence><sentence id="140">They changed it. </sentence><sentence id="141">Science was German. </sentence></p></dialogue>
