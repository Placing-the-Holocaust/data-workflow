<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="7">Norbert, where we left off, we were talking about <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> and you had been describing its __--_--~.~"There were some stories about <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> that you had wanted to share with me in particular. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="10">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="11">I think in in connection with the with the daily question we were confronted with...how do we survive, because once a ___--_--_ asked me I should tell him something about the art of survival, and the answer is their is no art, so I will...in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> it was an accident, or a chance. </sentence><sentence id="12">Uh certainly you had to have the the will to survive and I must say after the first couple of weeks or months, where very often I was confronted with the question, will I be able to make it, or should I rather uh uh uh put an end to my life in order to be liberated from the misery, but then after one year or so when I got the better job and could work as a welder, and also was able to uh to uh get some additional food here and there for certain activities, for instance, when I was was uh appointed a <span class="spatial object">bed-maker</span> and and also when I was appointed to be the secretary of the <span class="dlf">block</span> in order to keep the records, that gave me a chance uh then to to uh somehow keep myself cleaner and and uh also to...my my I would say was was strengthened by by by that...  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="13">A: Well, uh because I II helped out to a certain extent to uh to uh to uh...for instance, when there was...when food was distributed, you know, there was a certain order had to had to be established. </sentence><sentence id="14">I was able with my <span class="building">school</span> French, for instance, to speak to the Greek prisoners, people from Greek who spoke only Greek and French. </sentence><sentence id="15">That was...or or or Latino (ph). </sentence><sentence id="16">Latino certainly I didn't know, but my French was good enough to communicate with them, or also with the people from other <span class="country">countries</span> in order so that that uh ___I_ was trying to help and then obviously the secretary uh uh who was doing the work before left, so I was asked to do it and and I accepted it gladly because uh I didn't become an officer of the of the <span class="building">barrack</span>, but at least it gave me a certain chance to to to improve, which was...improve, you know, and and and and uh whatever improve means, you know...conditions somehow. </sentence><sentence id="17">Uh so therefore as I say, the the the uh the chance to to survive, the chance that, call it that on the morning you didn't know if the evening would be yours or in the evening when you went to <span class="spatial object">bed</span>, not to be sure that the next morning you were still alive...somehow turned more into the positive angle. </sentence><sentence id="18">You wanted to survive. </sentence><sentence id="19">You wanted uh to to to survive and and reach a normal world again, at least that was my feeling to, as  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection uh were were loosing at the <span class="region">eastern front</span> and every day was another step uh uh uh and one day hopefully the <span class="region">eastern front</span> would would reach us, because we were in the <span class="region">eastern part</span> of...located in the <span class="region">eastern part of Europe</span>. </sentence><sentence id="20">Uh the...that was one of the things in which the British were so helpful, and also to provide food and and support directly uh and I was also the beneficiary of many of their good deeds and I'll never forget about it. </sentence><sentence id="21">One of the things which interesting was that one day a fellow who came...he was from <span class="country">India</span> because his father was a sheriff in <span class="country">India</span> in the British administration. </sentence><sentence id="22">He had never seen <span class="country">England</span> and when we talked, I could tell him a little bit about my experience in <span class="populated place">London</span> and so we exchanged views and so we became friends. </sentence><sentence id="23">And he told me then one day...and then as...since our life was such a peculiar kind of life, without papers, without books, without...with hungry for for for some spiritual food also. </sentence><sentence id="24">Uh he told me somehow that he has gotten something from I don't which...an organization in <span class="populated place">Boston</span>, and I asked him, do you have contact with <span class="populated place">Boston</span>. </sentence><sentence id="25">He said sure, through my <span class="spatial object">military mail</span> I have. </sentence><sentence id="26">He said I have an idea. </sentence><sentence id="27">Could you eventually try to establish contact for me with my friend...with friends I have in <span class="country">America</span>, in the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="28">The address I knew by heart...you know, we had no address book anymore, but my memory, thank God, was good enough. </sentence><sentence id="29">He said sure I will, so I formulated for him a letter in which he said I met Norbert here. </sentence><sentence id="30">He is alright. </sentence><sentence id="31">He is fine. </sentence><sentence id="32">He doesn't know anything. </sentence><sentence id="33">He doesn't know where his family is right now. </sentence><sentence id="34">I mean we had to be very careful and he hopes one day to be able to see you again, so this letter he sent out, and it reached my friends, probably after months or so and uh in the closing days of <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>...I think it was already in December when when most of the <span class="region">industrial area</span> was was badly, badly smashed and destroyed...he was...all of a sudden came running and he said I have good news for you. </sentence><sentence id="35">I said what was it, another uh big uh big uh victory on the on the western or <span class="region">eastern front</span>. </sentence><sentence id="36">He said no, but believe it or not I got a letter back from your friends. </sentence><sentence id="37">Now this was something which <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> hadn't seen before, and I couldn't believe it so I was so This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="38">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="39"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection excited I I ran to the <span class="building">toilet house</span> in in the <span class="region">area</span> where we were working. </sentence><sentence id="40">Uh the man who was in charge of that was also an inmate and I said, listen, close all the <span class="dlf">doors</span> and I give you...I don't know how much I have or not have...I have to read this letter. </sentence><sentence id="41">And I read from my friends who obviously did not quite understand what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="42">How could they? </sentence><sentence id="43">Uh said well, I'm glad to hear about Norbert. </sentence><sentence id="44">Just assure him when you see him again that we are the same friends we were, because we were friends from the youth movement, that when the war is over, he should come and be with us and and and and and uh uh he uh he should be of good..good courage and so on. </sentence><sentence id="45">So when I told this my very close friends, nobody could believe it, so I had the fortitude to bring this letter and to smuggle this letter with me into the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, which was terribly dangerous certainly, but I wanted to show them also to give them some kind of courage. </sentence><sentence id="46">There is still...you see, can see even from <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, from behind the <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span>, there is a connection you can establish with people in <span class="country">America</span>, and uh then I came to this count...to <span class="country">America</span> in "46 on a visit. </sentence><sentence id="47">Uh I saw my friends in <span class="building">Decateur</span> (ph), <span class="region">Michigan</span>. </sentence><sentence id="48">They had a <span class="dlf">farm</span> there and uh uh I asked for that letter because I wanted to to make it part of my <span class="building">museum</span>, and they said uh no, they will never give it away, because...but what they...at this time when they got the letter, they were completely puzzled. </sentence><sentence id="49">They said, for goodness sake how can he be...they didn't certainly know which location it was because it was a military number under which it was sent...how could it be he is a British prisoner of war. </sentence><sentence id="50">What happened to him, so they were completely flabbergasted until I explained it to him, to them and they they they got aware uh that actually that this was something in which a British prisoner of war became call it the conduit for a message to <span class="country">America</span>, and I must say this gave me a tremendous lift up and and and and and uh I told some of my friends. </sentence><sentence id="51">Uh he could hardly believe it, but this is what you could do with the British because there was this solidarity of man. </sentence><sentence id="52">They understood you. </sentence><sentence id="53">And they didn't accept any kind of anti-Semitism or racism amongst them, because for them the Nazis This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="54">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="55"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection were not only enemies on a military uh basis but also certainly on a political and moral basis I would say. </sentence><sentence id="56">That was one of the things uh I certainly have never forgotten. </sentence><sentence id="57">There was also...I want to emphasize, there were other ways of spiritual resistance, to uh to uh nourish us spiritually. </sentence><sentence id="58">I think I talked about the service. </sentence><sentence id="59">But uh a typical example uh how how how spi...spiritual resistance can work is this example which I've cited very often. </sentence><sentence id="60">I met in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> uh very early at my arrival, an elderly man. </sentence><sentence id="61">He originated from somewhere in <span class="populated place">Galatia</span> (ph), had served during World War I in the Austrian army, and uh after the war, after World War I, he had made his way to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, had established some existence as a cobbler, had married, uh had a nice family, and with a so-called Polish ar...with a Polish accent, in September 1939 and he had been taken a prisoner and and and was shifted from <span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span> to <span class="populated place">Saxonhausen</span>, from <span class="populated place">Saxonhausen</span> to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, and so so he had, when I met him, already he had spent quite some years behind the <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span>. </sentence><sentence id="62">He was a won...a simple man, uh a pious man, very religious in spite of everything, in spite of everything, and he said his his prayers every day and he always when when things were were difficult, he gave us certain quotations from whatever he had to to say well, uh they cannot succeed. </sentence><sentence id="63">Uh we were stronger in spirit than they. </sentence><sentence id="64">One day...it was uh uh in fall I think of "44...whenever it was, the weather was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="65">There was...it was a rainy day and the winds come blowing down from the  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection you doing. </sentence><sentence id="66">He said as you can see I'm praying. </sentence><sentence id="67">I said but I'm certain you said your morning prayers and for the (cough) evening prayers, I said it's too early, so uh what are you praying for. </sentence><sentence id="68">He said, well, I'm not praying not the morning prayers, not the afternoon, not the evening prayers. </sentence><sentence id="69">I'll sing a special prayer to God. </sentence><sentence id="70">I said what are your praying for. </sentence><sentence id="71">He said I'm thanking God, and I always was bewildered. </sentence><sentence id="72">I said __, thanking for what, for that misery we are in, for the for the terrible situation, for being forsaken here by God. </sentence><sentence id="73">He said you don't understand. </sentence><sentence id="74">I am thanking for God, God for one thing...that he didn't make me like them, the murderers around me. </sentence><sentence id="75">Uh and interesting enough, a couple of months later uh we had to undergo one of these infamous uh selections. </sentence><sentence id="76">That means when there were too many people especially in the uh in the in the <span class="building">hospital</span>, uh then the and the SS came to the conclusion that they should uh uh...that those who cannot or were  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection seen the only way to do it, and he was an an old uh camp man and he knew all the tricks and so he said yes, I I'm willing to undergo this risk, so that's what we did. </sentence><sentence id="77">We put him into the the <span class="spatial object">mattress</span>, covered him with straw and when the selection went on, somebody else went from for him and uh uh when they also checked the the the <span class="building">barracks</span>, didn't find him in the in the in the <span class="spatial object">mattress</span>, so he luckily survived and he survived also the the end of the war and just two or three years ago he uh he uh died in <span class="populated place">New York</span> at the blessed age of ninety-two. </sentence><sentence id="78">There's another interesting uh uh facet of this which uh has also uh described in his book, . </sentence><sentence id="79">Uh it was I think already I think in the  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection death sentence was usually confirmed by by ___, by the by the Gestapo, by the uh uh by Himmler's (ph) office in in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, and then one day when we mar...came back from work, we saw the <span class="spatial object">gallows</span> uh uh erected at the <span class="dlf">square</span> where we had our our our roll call, and we knew that uh that uh...we didn't know exactly what we saw...three <span class="spatial object">gallows</span> awaiting there, and then we got aware that these were these three friends who uh who uh obviously uh uh the order was...who who could not be saved and uh we all had to stand there at attention and the atmosphere was terribly tense because most of us knew them, appreciated them, loved them, knew about their courage and their dedication for fellow, for fellow inmates, so we were absolutely down and depressed, and then the spectacle began. </sentence><sentence id="80">They were led to the <span class="spatial object">gallows</span> and then one of the SS gangsters read the so-called death sentence, which was confirmed by <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> that because of their attempt to flee they have been...the Reichsfuhrer (ph) Himmler has decided that they should be put to death, and when they were under the <span class="spatial object">gallows</span> and the ropes already around them, one of the three...by the way uh uh one of them is the brother of our friend Freddie who is very active in our affairs in in <span class="region">California</span>. </sentence><sentence id="81">One of them all of a sudden penetrated this deadly silence with a voice which could be heard all over the the place and he said it in German. </sentence><sentence id="82">I will translate it ina moment. </sentence><sentence id="83">He said to...or he he cried out uh , which means, comrades, keep your highs heads...keep your heads high. </sentence><sentence id="84">We  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection minutes, uh to tell us don't worry about us, but you will have the uh the the the chance to see hopefully the other <span class="env feature">world</span> waiting beyond the the <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span>. </sentence><sentence id="85">So uh uh you see, and this this is this is this is uh just amongst the many things we we know from that time, proof that uh phys...spiritual resistance had remained in spite of the fact, and I can say for myself also personally, to say that well, they tried to make us a number but they will never convert us into a number. </sentence><sentence id="86">So this this this was, as I say, it was already at a time when when when when uh the <span class="env feature">air</span>, the <span class="dlf">political air</span> was was so different. </sentence><sentence id="87">People still died uh daily. </sentence><sentence id="88">There was still enough victims unfortunately, but when it came uh to this time, uh uh uh there...it it...the whole, the whole atmosphere had changed when particularly when certainly was that you could feel slowly also the military effect of the advances of the of the advance of the Allies in the <span class="region">east</span> and the <span class="region">west</span>. </sentence><sentence id="89">In uh...I think it was in in August, early in August, we saw from from our places in the <span class="building">factory</span> and the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, we saw our first major attack by the American air force uh uh stationed at this time in <span class="country">Italy</span>, coming from <span class="country">Italy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="90">They had attained almost completely already supremacy in the <span class="env feature">air</span> and they uh uh...I think it was early in August attacked arefineryin__I think is the name, and for days we saw the black smoke covering the whole <span class="region">area</span>, so we we thought for ourselves, well one day they must come and and also try to hit this <span class="building">factory</span> which did not produce yet but was very close to completion and sure enough, on on August 20th, 1944...it was a Sunday...the American air force uh to attack the uh uh combine...uh  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0 (ph)...that is the price. </sentence><sentence id="91">Uh one bomb, interesting enough, also by mistake uh uh went down in our own <span class="populated place">camp</span>, which is outside of the <span class="building">factory</span>...which was outside of the <span class="building">factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="92">Didn't do any damage, but another bomb by mistake hit the British prisoners of war. </sentence><sentence id="93">They were sitting outside of some kind of a <span class="dlf">trench</span> and uh uh forty of of those people were killed. </sentence><sentence id="94">They were playing <span class="spatial object">gramophone</span> (ph) music because they liked it so much to see the the the __ but then the bomb unfortunately hit, and amongst them was also a nice friend of mine, a man whom I befriended who who originated from <span class="populated place">London</span>, but also the British said well, that's it. </sentence><sentence id="95">That's the price we have to pay. </sentence><sentence id="96">Uh this is when we...when we went into action in <span class="country">Africa</span>. </sentence><sentence id="97">We knew that that something like this could happen so that was it. </sentence><sentence id="98">What we...what what uh we thought after this, after this experience was why don't they come also to to uh hit the <span class="dlf">railways</span> leading to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="99">We didn't know at this time that, for instance, Jewish leaders were storming the chancellories in <span class="populated place">London</span> and in <span class="populated place">Washington</span> uh uh to do something like that and certainly we we didn't know that there was a letter then written...I think under the signature of the then Assistant Secretary of the Army John McL___, saying that uh uh the uh governments have to concentrate on the completion of the war and also they are afraid and this is the the wording, that if something would be done in the interest of the prisoners, the Nazis could become more vindi...vindictive towards the prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="100">Well uh uh... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="199">Q: How did you feel when day by day went by and they did not bomb the <span class="dlf">railroad lines</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="201">A: I couldn't understand that. </sentence><sentence id="202">I couldn't understand that. </sentence><sentence id="203">Uh as I say, this question came up more after the war when I asked the people what...we we...on the other hand, peculiar as it may sound, we were so glad to see them because we were...when the attack came, for instance, , the only protection we had was outside in <span class="dlf">trenches</span> where you could see these hundreds  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 1 and hundreds of <span class="building">fortresses</span>, of <span class="building">flying fortresses</span>, coming and and and and there was hardly any anti- craft fire from from the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="204">Certainly our people, many of our people were were crying and so and and praying, and my reaction was, I said be happy uh to see them because you might have relatives sitting in the <span class="spatial object">cockpit</span>, you know, and and doing this work in our interest, and certainly you had to reckon that you could be also amongst the <span class="spatial object">targets</span>, but this is...in war, you know, you you you unfortunately you don't know where it hits. </sentence><sentence id="205">Uh so after the first event in August, after that very effective attack, we were put to work immediately to try to uh undo the damage, because they wanted...they had a certain date... don't know which...to uh to uh uh not to start production but to uh to also to get into production somehow, and I think the day before the deadline, the the <span class="spatial object">bombers</span> came again with another attack and then uh the next uh day, the next target to to have the repair, the damage repaired was I think the day after Christmas, and sure enough on Christmas they came again, and they smashed the <span class="building">factory</span> to smitherings and to such extent that nothing could be done anymore and there was...then the the morale I would say broke in this respect that they said there's nothing to be done anymore, so we were just trying to play around and play for time if possible. </sentence><sentence id="206">Also uh then realizing especially in December that the <span class="region">Russian front</span> had become very close. </sentence><sentence id="207">We knew that__ had been taken and that that certainly that they came pretty close, the Russian army close to <span class="populated place">Krackow</span>, and uh then uh uh in the course of the military events, in January when the uh Russians started their offensive across the I think, and uh reached <span class="populated place">Krackow</span>...<span class="populated place">Krackow</span> was  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 2 What I had done in case they they should drive us out, I had put on my my British underwear and my British boots I had kept available in so in case we we were we were driven out, and sure enough... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="217">Q: Excuse me. </sentence><sentence id="218">I'm going to pause because I want to know where did you get British underwear and British boots? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="221">A: From my friends, from the British soldiers, you know. </sentence><sentence id="222">They had enough stuff and part of it...as I say I was one of their benefactors and they gave me what...not only certain things I hadn't seen for years like chocolate and once in a while cigarettes which I didn't smoke, but gave away, but they...when I told them that and we talked about...they had wonderful stuff, uh uh which they got from the <span class="building">International Red Cross</span>, that certain underwear and also I had a pair of shoes I I could call it organize from them, and they were very generous and very gracious to me. </sentence><sentence id="223">I might owe the the <span class="building">British treasury</span> something for that. </sentence><sentence id="224">I don't know, but uh anyhow that's what it what it was, and uh yes...on August 18th, uh somehow we heard that the the Russians had uh uh broken through the <span class="dlf">German lines</span>, had uh entered <span class="populated place">Krackow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="225">We saw on the on the <span class="dlf">road</span> adjacent to our <span class="populated place">camp</span>, we saw already all these <span class="spatial object">trucks</span>, the <span class="spatial object">German military trucks</span> and <span class="spatial object">tanks</span> and so passing by, but in the direction towards the <span class="region">west</span>, so they were fleeing. </sentence><sentence id="226">And uh the question was will the Russians uh liberate us or what's going to happen, and then uh on August 18th, uh in the middle of the day, the order came that we had to be ready by four o'clock. </sentence><sentence id="227">We didn't know what...I1 mean we had no watches so it was...four o'clock was on their time. </sentence><sentence id="228">Everybody had to be ready to uh to walk out with the exception of those people in the in the uh uh <span class="building">hospital</span> who couldn't walk, and we were certain that uh they would be killed there because they wouldn't let them fall into the hands of the Russian army, </sentence></p><p><sentence id="229"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="230">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="231"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 3 of the Red army, and also we saw the day before by the way, that a lot obviously of papers uh uh had been burned, so the SS got already uh marching order with the with the with the order also to take care of papers which could be could be uh uh used against them, and then on the 18th in the afternoon we walked out and also the the the women of the of the <span class="building">brothel</span> walked out and it was approximate...it was a a terrible wintry day, approximately we heard this...it was minus eighteen centigrades, which I think is less than zero fahrenheit. </sentence><sentence id="232">There were the icy <span class="dlf">streets</span> on which we walked, and that was the first time that I saw again the outside there. </sentence><sentence id="233">The uh guards were very, very tense and afraid because they were they were deadly afraid that the Russians would overtake them and certainly uh being in an SS uniform was not...they knew it would not be very helpful for them. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="234">We uh...whatever we had, I mean we had a little bit of bread and that was...a little bit of...I don't know...margarine. </sentence><sentence id="235">That's all we could...we had to...that was for the whole the whole time, we could carry, and uh we were...as I said we walked and marched, so called marching order and very soon on account of the weather and so people people dropped left and right, and if they did were shot at...on the spot. </sentence><sentence id="236">Some, interesting enough, especially of Polish people, non-Jews (cough) who knew that eventually or who hoped that the population around <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> would help them, tried to escape into the <span class="env feature">woods</span>, which during the night was was was daring but still most of them were successful because all all the shooting didn't help because most of the bullets hit the <span class="env feature">trees</span> and not the people who had who had escaped, but for us there was there was no choice. </sentence><sentence id="237">We walked all night. </sentence><sentence id="238">We walked and and, interesting enough, we we saw, we heard the guns blazing. </sentence><sentence id="239">We saw the

writings, especially also in the book of ____ about the banality of evil, there were very unfair text against him, against Leo Beck, based on a story which I consider a historic lie.

under the title "We Have Survived." </sentence><sentence id="679">And he published one story which he published in such a way as if it was the writing by Leo Beck, but anybody who was familiar with
