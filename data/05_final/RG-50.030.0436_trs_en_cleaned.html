<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="59">A: Very mixed, our neighbors left and right were not Jews, but there were also quite a few Jews among them. </sentence><sentence id="60">It was, until 1937, I was not at all aware. </sentence><sentence id="61">I shouldn't say that because I do remember now that on Memorial Day, which is a holiday for everywhere in the world and schoolchildren went to the <span class="dlf">cemetery</span> but the Jewish schoolchildren were separated from the others and went to the <span class="dlf">Jewish cemetery</span>. </sentence><sentence id="62">That is when I became aware that, that there was a difference between the other children and me. </sentence><sentence id="63">That's all I remember. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="69">Q: But nothing that made you feel terribly different? </sentence><sentence id="70">Were you, were you ever aware of anti- Semitism, early in... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="73">A: Yes, yes, at that time I became aware of anti-Semitism and particularly in 1937, there were times where in our <span class="populated place">town</span>, soldiers, Romanian soldiers and particularly Romanian officers, who probably often got drunk, were roaming the <span class="dlf">streets</span> with guns, with the <span class="spatial object">revolvers</span> in their hands and yelling loud words against Jews. </sentence><sentence id="74">Yes, I was, that was when I began to be very much afraid. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="77">Q: Did, did that attitude affect the, your Christian friends? </sentence><sentence id="78">I mean, did they pick up the spirit of that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="81">A: No, not particularly, as a matter of fact, I remember one incident where this one Romanian officer was running through the <span class="dlf">streets</span> and yelling, "I'm going to kill all the Jews." </sentence><sentence id="82">A couple of friends of my father's, my stepfather, this was in 1937,"38, a couple of friends who were not Jews, tried to approach this officer and to talk reason to him and they were, I had completely the feeling that they were on our side, that they were not against us and they were two of the leading people in <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="83">So I didn't have a complete feeling of being betrayed by every Christian, you know. </sentence><sentence id="84">But, I can't describe it too well, this is how it began. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="89">Q: And then at what point did it get worse? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="91">A: Well we heard then the speeches that Hitler gave on the <span class="spatial object">radio</span> and we kept thinking, well it's not going to last too long, because sane people would not accept this and all, and anyway it's not here, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="92">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="93"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection it's somewhere in <span class="country">Germany</span> and then it was in <span class="country">Austria</span> and then it was in <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>, but and then it was in <span class="country">Poland</span>, and <span class="country">Poland</span> was pretty close to where we lived, but we still couldn't believe it, we still didn't think that it would find us. </sentence><sentence id="94">I can't, when I think of this now, I just can't understand how my parents did not accept my uncle's offer to leave. </sentence><sentence id="95">They, they simply didn't think that anything could happen to them. </sentence><sentence id="96">And we saw a number of Jews from <span class="country">Poland</span> coming to our <span class="populated place">town</span> and we made <span class="interior space">room</span> where we lived for them to sleep and we saw how it happened, but we still didn't believe it. </sentence><sentence id="97">And then in 1940, when Hitler and Stalin made this pact, we had not very much of a choice. </sentence><sentence id="98">We thought, since we knew what happened under Hitler to people, that we would in fact be better off to stay where we are and very many people were glad that the Soviets came. </sentence><sentence id="99">Of course, we didn't know what would happen. </sentence><sentence id="100">It was hard. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="112">Q: Can you tell me a little bit about life under the Soviets? </sentence><sentence id="113">I know that you've told me before that your <span class="building">home</span> was taken away from you. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="118">Q: What else? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="120">A: The interesting part was that their propaganda was so efficient, they, there were concerts, the people danced in the <span class="dlf">streets</span>. </sentence><sentence id="121">There were speeches that there is no better quality of life than in the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span>. </sentence><sentence id="122">The children got their education for free. </sentence><sentence id="123">The older people got their medical help for free. </sentence><sentence id="124">People were taken care of from their birth to their day they died. </sentence><sentence id="125">They never had to worry. </sentence><sentence id="126">And all of this wonderful thing happened because the Communist government knew how to take care of it's people. </sentence><sentence id="127">And in the meantime, during the night, people disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="128">And this, this was very, very difficult, because it hit us almost immediately and then one of the Soviets, who moved into our <span class="building">house</span>, told me, first of all he said to me, "You know that there is no God." </sentence><sentence id="129">And you know this, for me, even though I was not brought up in a strict religious sense, it was awful thing for me to hear. </sentence><sentence id="130">And then when my father was taken away, this man, whose name I do not know, I don't think I even knew it then, this man said to me, "Look, you are a young person, you have the best chance for a wonderful life in our <span class="country">country</span>, but you have to put an ad in the paper that you want to have nothing to do with your father, who is an enemy of the people." </sentence><sentence id="131">And of course I didn't do it. </sentence><sentence id="132">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="133">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="134"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection This is how life was under the Soviets. </sentence><sentence id="135">We saw a big <span class="spatial object">poster</span>, said, was seen in many places. </sentence><sentence id="136">Stalin was holding on his lap a child and giving the child a wristwatch, because that child had informed the teacher that the parents at <span class="building">home</span> had spoken against the government. </sentence><sentence id="137">And what the parents had said was, "No eggs today for breakfast." </sentence><sentence id="138">And the father had said, "Again no eggs?" </sentence><sentence id="139">And this was regarded as counter-revolutionary talk. </sentence><sentence id="140">The parents were arrested and the child got a watch. </sentence><sentence id="141">The parents disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="142">That was how life was. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="169">A: People went to <span class="building">school</span> and <span class="building">Jewish businesses</span> were taken away, all <span class="building">businesses</span> were taken away but the difference was that the Christians who had <span class="building">businesses</span> could, under the pack that Hitler and Stalin had, could say that they are false Germans, which means that their ancestors were of German background and therefore they were not arrested. </sentence><sentence id="170">They had the right to be resettled into <span class="country">Germany</span> and while the Soviets took away their <span class="building">houses</span> in Sattagura(ph) or in one of those <span class="populated place">towns</span>, when they were resettled, they got an, an equivalent <span class="building">house</span> or <span class="interior space">apartment</span> in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="171">And I even know about one man who was taken the same night as my father, who was a Christian and who was a merchant, a businessman. </sentence><sentence id="172">He, he dealt with, he sold ham and, and kielbasa and had pigs and made them, made, made these foods at <span class="building">home</span> and then sold them. </sentence><sentence id="173">Well he was regarded a Capitalist. </sentence><sentence id="174">He was taken the same night, but he said that he was a false Deutschner(ph), he was not, he was actually a half Polish, half-Ukrainian Christian. </sentence><sentence id="175">Well he was taken out of the <span class="building">prison</span> and sent to <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="176">And he escaped, my father didn't. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="189">Q: Was there fear on the <span class="dlf">streets</span>, was it better or worse than the Romanians who were hunting down people? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="191">A: Yes and no. </sentence><sentence id="192">A very difficult thing to answer. </sentence><sentence id="193">The people who were not arrested and who were friendly towards the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span>, didn't feel that they had anything to fear. </sentence><sentence id="194">They thought that it would be just the very rich people who, who should be treated that way, because they, they really This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="195">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="196"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection shouldn't be so rich. </sentence><sentence id="197">But very slowly, it became clear to everybody that you couldn't talk. </sentence><sentence id="198">Even though they said you had freedom to say anything, you knew that you couldn't, you couldn't even think against them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
