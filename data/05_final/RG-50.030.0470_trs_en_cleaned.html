<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="17">A: T-e-o.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="138">Q: And her maiden name was Deutsch? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="140">A: Deutsch. </sentence><sentence id="141">So, my grandfather, my maternal grandfather was Leopold Deutsch. </sentence><sentence id="142">My grandmother was Katarina, and they had three children. </sentence><sentence id="143">I'm sorry, they had three daughters and a son, four children. </sentence><sentence id="144">The oldest -- the oldest daughter was <span class="populated place">Giza</span>, then Blanka, and then Silva, and the son was Emme. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="150">Q: And <span class="populated place">Giza</span> plays an important role in your life? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="152">A: <span class="populated place">Giza</span> plays an important role in my life. </sentence><sentence id="153">Well, <span class="building">Blanka</span> does too in some sense because basically they lived sort of together. </sentence><sentence id="154">The family lived together. </sentence><sentence id="155">It was a small <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="156"><span class="populated place">Giza</span> was ten years, I'm sorry, fifteen years older than my mother. </sentence><sentence id="157">So, she often was sort of active as my mother's mother in they -- I see pictures that they had traveled together, for example, all three sisters to the <span class="env feature">seashore</span>. </sentence><sentence id="158">The middle sister got married fairly young and had two children, two daughters -- Zdenka and Vera. </sentence><sentence id="159">Their name was Appler, and the youngest -- the youngest daughter, my mother, was eventually sent to a <span class="building">school</span> in <span class="populated place">Cakovec</span> which is another small <span class="populated place">town</span>, much larger <span class="populated place">town</span> actually than <span class="populated place">Ludbreg</span>, much closer even to the <span class="dlf">Hungarian border</span>, and she went there to a teacher's -- a <span class="building">teacher's school</span>, became an <span class="building">elementary school</span> teacher. </sentence><sentence id="160">The middle sister who was married, was married to Rudi Appler, who came to <span class="populated place">Ludbreg</span>, opened a <span class="building">store</span>, and that's -- and that's where they had two children. </sentence><sentence id="161">The oldest of the three, <span class="populated place">Giza</span>, worked in the <span class="building">bank</span>, in the <span class="building">Ludbreg Bank</span>, and there she met a person who was to play a large part in my life and that was Ludva Vrancic. </sentence><sentence id="162">Ljudevit is actually his real name. </sentence><sentence id="163">I'll get back to him. </sentence><sentence id="164">The brother Erne worked in <span class="populated place">Zagreb</span>, worked early in <span class="populated place">Zagreb</span>, and I'm not exactly sure what he did there. </sentence><sentence id="165">I think clerical work of some sort. </sentence><sentence id="166">I'm not sure of what he did. </sentence><sentence id="167">And the -- my mother eventually finished the teacher's <span class="building">school</span> and worked as a teacher in a small <span class="populated place">village</span> near <span class="populated place">Ludbreg</span> for a short period of time. </sentence><sentence id="168">Then my father and she met and married and left to live in <span class="populated place">Zagreb</span>, and that's how I happened to have been born in <span class="populated place">Zagreb</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="186">Q: So, let me ask you something, you were a very, very young child when the war came in 1941. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="188">A: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="190">Q: So, what I need you to try to do is to distinguish what you've learned from other people and what you actually remember, because you were so little. </sentence><sentence id="191">So, if you can, as you speak, make that distinction, it might be very helpful. </sentence><sentence id="192">So, this is what my first question is for </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="196"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="197">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="198"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="199"> you. </sentence><sentence id="200">What is your -- do you have any memories before 1941, before you leave <span class="populated place">Zagreb</span> to go to <span class="populated place">Ludbreg</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="201">A: Images. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="203">Q: Images? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="205">A: Yes, I have in my head an image of my mother, but it's very hard to really tell because I was fortunate to have a lot of pictures of my parents, which I think a lot of children that lived through the Holocaust never got to have. </sentence><sentence id="206">And so it's very difficult because I've seen those pictures all my life. </sentence><sentence id="207">It's very difficult to really distinguish what's memory and what's a photograph that you have in your head. </sentence><sentence id="208">So, I think I have an image in my head, but I can't really tell you whether I do or don't. </sentence><sentence id="209">I think I have an image of myself leaving on a <span class="spatial object">train</span>, because I left apparently when I was three years old. </sentence><sentence id="210">I left <span class="populated place">Zagreb</span> with friends of my grandparents and went to <span class="populated place">Ludbreg</span>, and that happened before, just before, the war started, from what I understand. </sentence><sentence id="211">And, again, I don't have any idea whether -- because people often ask me whether I remember whether I was sent away because my parents were afraid of what's going to happen, or whether I was just going to visit my family just to visit my family or whether my mother, who already -- my brother had already been born, he was three years younger than I -- whether, you know, she said, you know, why not have this kid go away while she has a baby? </sentence><sentence id="212">I have no -- no idea why I was sent except there was an opportunity. </sentence><sentence id="213">These neighbors came and I went with them, and I don't remember being tearful or I don't remember the farewell. </sentence><sentence id="214">I don't remember any of that, but that was the last time I saw my parents. </sentence><sentence id="215">I don't remember any farewells. </sentence><sentence id="216">I remember sort of being on the <span class="spatial object">train</span> and there being fun. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="229">Q: It was fun? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="231">A: Mm-hmm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="233">Q: Was that the first time you were on a <span class="spatial object">train</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="235">A: Oh, I think so, probably. </sentence><sentence id="236">Well, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="237">It's very hard to tell. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="241">Q: Do you remember the birth of your brother? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="243">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="245">Q: You don't remember him as this tiny little baby? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="247">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="248">No. </sentence><sentence id="249">I mean, I remember him, however, when I do remember him very well is when he was brought to <span class="populated place">Ludbreg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="250">That I remember. </sentence><sentence id="251">That I really do remember. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="257">Q: So, were you told about your mother going to <span class="building">school</span>, because clearly you were too young. </sentence><sentence id="258">Your mother wouldn't have explained to you that she was a teacher. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="261"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="262">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="263"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="264">A: No, none of that. </sentence><sentence id="265">I'm just saying the background of what really -- of what this family was all about, who was who. </sentence><sentence id="266">I have not the foggiest. </sentence><sentence id="267">No, of course not, because all of that happened before I was born. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="272">Q: What did your father do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="274">A: My father had apparently learned the trade of brushmaking, and had opened a <span class="building">workshop</span> to make brushes. </sentence><sentence id="275">From what I am told by his surviving brother, he was very good at it, and by the time that I was born, I can tell from, again, from the pictures of him, what people told me, there was a small <span class="building">workshop</span> with, I don't know, ten or so workmen, and there was <span class="spatial object">machinery</span> and they made brushes and was very successful at it. </sentence><sentence id="276">But, I, again, don't have any memory of it. </sentence><sentence id="277">I only know pictures and stories. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="282">Q: Is this difficult for you as an adult person thinking about who were these parents and what you have are paper pictures? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="284">A: It's not actually that difficult. </sentence><sentence id="285">The reason for it is that it was not a new discovery that I made as an adult. </sentence><sentence id="286">If I had known nothing of that, and all of a sudden as an adult it came upon me, yes, of course, it would have been difficult. </sentence><sentence id="287">But I grew up with all of that. </sentence><sentence id="288">It's -- it's just part and parcel of my growing up. </sentence><sentence id="289">I always heard stories and always knew who I was and I always had these pictures so that, you know, it's, you know, you just to grow up with stories. </sentence><sentence id="290">That's all. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="298">Q: So, you go to Ludberg- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="300">A: <span class="populated place">Ludbreg</span>, which actually has a meaning. </sentence><sentence id="301">The word "lud" in Croatian means crazy or mad. </sentence><sentence id="302">This is kind of crazy. </sentence><sentence id="303">And "<span class="env feature">breg</span>", I think, means a <span class="env feature">mountain</span>, but it also could be the words got transposed and it was "<span class="env feature">berg</span>" which means <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="304">So, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="305">Nobody ever explained why this is called that, but it's <span class="populated place">Ludbreg</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="312">Q: Do you have a first memory of <span class="populated place">Ludbreg</span>? </sentence><sentence id="313">Remember arriving? </sentence><sentence id="314">You don't remember - </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="318">A: No, I don't remember arriving. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="320">Q: With your grandparents? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="322">A: I remember very well being with my grandparents. </sentence><sentence id="323">That I do remember, and again, I have certain images like I remember sitting with my grandfather in a <span class="interior space">room</span> and playing at his feet, and he was paralyzed already on one side because he had a stroke. </sentence><sentence id="324">And he was trying to pick up the <span class="spatial object">toys</span> that I was playing with, something like that, and he fell. </sentence><sentence id="325">It was a traumatic experience for me. </sentence><sentence id="326">So, I remember that, and I remember Hanukkah. </sentence><sentence id="327">I remember the- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="334">Q: What happened after he fell? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="336">A: Oh, someone came -- he couldn't pick himself up. </sentence><sentence id="337">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="338">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="339"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="344">Q: You just-- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="346">A: I just remember that I was guilty of throwing the <span class="spatial object">toys</span> around or something. </sentence><sentence id="347">So, I remember being upset and crying. </sentence><sentence id="348">So, that's why I remember that. </sentence><sentence id="349">I remember Hanukkah for example, but not the whole thing. </sentence><sentence id="350">I remember candles and I remember getting an orange, which was very exciting. </sentence><sentence id="351">Oranges were not to be had. </sentence><sentence id="352">I remember at Pesach, or before Pesach. </sentence><sentence id="353">I remember that they were burying <span class="spatial object">silverware</span>, and I thought that was a very strange thing to do, but that's apparently what can be done. </sentence><sentence id="354">I found that much later. </sentence><sentence id="355">I had no idea of that. </sentence><sentence id="356">I remember my grandfather sitting in the <span class="dlf">garden</span> with all of us playing around and he used to -- he used to have his little <span class="spatial object">table</span> in front. </sentence><sentence id="357">This was, mind you, we were living in the <span class="building">house</span> that was attached to the <span class="building">synagogue</span>, and it was also -- and everything -- all the Jewish community matters played themselves out there. </sentence><sentence id="358">So, there was also the <span class="building">school</span> and there were some kind of <span class="interior space">classrooms</span>, and, of course, that was there much later. </sentence><sentence id="359">It's been destroyed now, but -- so, he would sit in the <span class="dlf">garden</span> with the little <span class="spatial object">table</span> and he had little piles of money in front of him and there were beggars that were sort of like professional beggars in that <span class="populated place">town</span>, and they would come Wednesdays and Saturdays because those were <span class="building">market</span> days in <span class="populated place">Ludbreg</span>, and on Saturdays, of course, he wouldn't do that, but -- that's Shabbat, but on Wednesdays they would sit and they would come and take their little <span class="spatial object">piles</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="374">Q: They, as far as you knew, they were specifically for these particular people? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="376">A: Yes, yes, there was specific people. </sentence><sentence id="377">There was a specific beggar that used to come to our --to the <span class="building">house</span> where I lived much, much later and he would come every Wednesday and would always get alms, and I remember seeing him later on on the <span class="spatial object">train</span> and being like a normal person, you know? </sentence><sentence id="378">It was very strange, but they were characters. </sentence><sentence id="379"><span class="populated place">Ludbreg</span>'s a very small <span class="populated place">town</span>, and especially was, and everybody sort of knew everybody and there were all these sort of different routines that were going on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="384">Q: Since you said there were about 30 families who lived here, how much larger was the <span class="populated place">town</span>? </sentence><sentence id="385">A couple of hundred families? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="779">A: Yeah, oh yeah. </sentence><sentence id="780">There were -- the <span class="dlf">street</span> that I lived on was after the war called, "The <span class="dlf">Street</span> of the 17" <span class="building">Udarna Brigada</span>". </sentence><sentence id="781">1 don't know how to translate -- <span class="building">Brigade</span> is <span class="building">Brigada</span>, of course. </sentence><sentence id="782">Udarna means -- it's striking, one who can strike well, particularly well. </sentence><sentence id="783">And the reason it's called that is because the members of that brigade, the remnant of that brigade lost their lives. </sentence><sentence id="784">They killed themselves at the end of the battle in a <span class="building">house</span> that was down my <span class="dlf">street</span> because they were totally surrounded. </sentence><sentence id="785">They had fought all night, and they were totally surrounded, and in the end, they just threw a bomb among themselves because they didn't want to be captured. </sentence><sentence id="786">But there were fights and we would spend -- we spent a lot of time in the <span class="interior space">basement</span>. </sentence><sentence id="787">We had a <span class="interior space">cellar</span>, not a <span class="interior space">basement</span> in an American sense. </sentence><sentence id="788">It was a <span class="interior space">cellar</span>. </sentence><sentence id="789">We had a <span class="dlf">vineyard</span>, and we had wine, and there were big <span class="spatial object">barrels</span> down there, and <span class="spatial object">shelves</span> and <span class="spatial object">shelves</span> full of apples that were there for the winter. </sentence><sentence id="790">And at one point, we had <span class="spatial object">beds</span> down there, <span class="spatial object">rollaway beds</span>. </sentence><sentence id="791">And we spent every night there because we knew that there would be bad fighting. </sentence><sentence id="792">Sometimes, but sometimes, we would forget to go down there on time, and -- not forget -- I'm sorry, we didn't know that we should go down there on time. </sentence><sentence id="793">So, then if a fight -- if a battle started, there was no way to get there because you had to get out of the <span class="building">house</span> to get -- to go into the <span class="interior space">cellar</span>, and so it was too dangerous already to do that. </sentence><sentence id="794">So, we stayed in the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>

http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 7 two famous Vrancic people. </sentence><sentence id="998">There was the Cardinal, and then there was an inventor, a fairly famous inventor by that name, and then the mother's family was called Svagel, and they were nobility, minor nobility, nevertheless, they had the PL, which is the approval of a in their name, and the silver has that and so on. </sentence><sentence id="999">And they established themselves in this <span class="populated place">town</span>, and they had a dozen children, none of whom survived who remarried. </sentence><sentence id="1000">They all died fairly young, not the children necessarily, some yes, but fairly -- sort of as teenagers or young people, and as my memory goes, there were only two survivors and they were already in their fairly old age. </sentence><sentence id="1001">One of them was Vika and the other was Ludva, and Vika remained single and died in the middle of the war, and I remember her quite well. </sentence><sentence id="1002">Ludva was the person who was extremely well-known in that <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1003">He was -- he had been a mayor. </sentence><sentence id="1004">He was a organizer of the <span class="building">sports club</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1005">He was the organizer of -- he was the head of the <span class="building">soccer club</span> even though he never played soccer. </sentence><sentence id="1006">He organized everything in that <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1007">He was especially having to do with music. </sentence><sentence id="1008">He loved music. </sentence><sentence id="1009">He played the violin. </sentence><sentence id="1010">He organized two different kinds of orchestras. </sentence><sentence id="1011">He was the heart of that <span class="populated place">town</span> in terms of any kind of cultural life. </sentence><sentence id="1012">When he fell in love with my aunt, and he, of course, this was a Croatian Catholic family, and my aunt was the daughter of the rabbi, not exactly the right combination for the times, forever, but certainly not for that time. </sentence><sentence id="1013">And he was ten years older than she, and they knew each other especially from the <span class="building">bank</span> because he was a director of a part of another <span class="building">bank</span>, and she worked there. </sentence><sentence id="1014">And, again, I know that only from stories. </sentence><sentence id="1015">I asked him many times afterwards, "So, why didn't you get married for such a long time?" </sentence><sentence id="1016">Because they got married in 1937, I think, or 1939, I'm not too sure. </sentence><sentence id="1017">I should know that, but anyway, and he always told me, "Well, she was very happy living with her family, with her parents, and I was fine living with my sister and my mother. </sentence><sentence id="1018">There was no need to get married." </sentence><sentence id="1019">Well, I rather doubted that was how it was, but that's how he always said it. </sentence><sentence id="1020">But I'm sure that my grandparents did not -- were not thrilled their daughter going with a Catholic person. </sentence><sentence id="1021">However, in all the pictures of the family for a very long time, he's always present. </sentence><sentence id="1022">So, it wasn't like he wasn't accepted totally, and I think by the time the war was imminent in <span class="country">Europe</span>, and they knew what was happening, they decided to get married. </sentence><sentence id="1023">So, they got married. </sentence><sentence id="1024">They actually had to go to <span class="country">Hungary</span> to get married because you couldn't get married in a civil ceremony in <span class="country">Croatia</span> or <span class="country">Yugoslavia</span>, that is, and neither of them was converting to anything. </sentence><sentence id="1025">So, they got married in a civil ceremony. </sentence><sentence id="1026">So, the <span class="building">house</span> that we basically had lived was the <span class="building">Vrancic house</span>, and then they and my other aunt, the Appler family, decided to build a <span class="building">house</span> of their own, but it was within the same <span class="dlf">compound</span>, the same <span class="region">land base</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1027">So, that's how we ended up having these two <span class="building">houses</span> that were next to one another, and the other one was supposed to be a big <span class="building">two-story house</span> with a <span class="building">store</span> on the bottom for my uncle, a small <span class="interior space">apartment</span> in the back, which is we ended up living and these people who often hid me lived there, and then there was supposed to be two <span class="interior space">apartments</span> upstairs, and that never got finished, of course, before the war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
