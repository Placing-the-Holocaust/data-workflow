Well, around March I got a letter from Tosia Altman, that Arieh Wilner, one of our leading persons in the organization, was caught by the Gestapo and he's under investigation and that I should leave immediately, the <span class="building">hospital</span>, because in all probability Arieh, which was, you know, Jurek was his pseudo name in occupation time that Jurek might have some picture of me and maybe even some letters from me to him. </sentence><sentence id="2597">So, I had to leave immediately, which I did. </sentence><sentence id="2598">On my way out from the <span

of things. </sentence><sentence id="4462">But at that time, certain things we heard for the first time, like what was going on in <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4463">I was never in a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>, but there were people coming from these <span class="populated place">camps</span> and starting

Jews to come to, but also to send out people to look for liberated Jews, you know. </sentence><sentence id="4467">Because when people were liberated by the Soviet Army, the first impulse of people was
