Well, around March I got a letter from Tosia Altman, that Arieh Wilner, one of our leading persons in the organization, was caught by the Gestapo and he's under investigation and that I should leave immediately, the <span class="building">hospital</span>, because in all probability Arieh, which was, you know, Jurek was his pseudo name in occupation time that Jurek might have some picture of me and maybe even some letters from me to him. </sentence><sentence id="2616">So, I had to leave immediately, which I did. </sentence><sentence id="2617">On my way out from the <span
