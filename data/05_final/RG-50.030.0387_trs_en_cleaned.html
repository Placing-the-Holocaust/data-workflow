</sentence><sentence id="136">They planted a lot of cabbage and a plenty of potatoes and some wheat and also a lot of rye. </sentence><sentence id="137">Our <span class="env feature">land</span> was in many little pieces, so we had to travel from a <span class="populated place">village</span> to work on, on the <span class="env feature">land</span>. </sentence><sentence id="138">My father -- just about like me -- spent a lot of time in strange places. </sentence><sentence id="139">The part of <span class="country">Poland</span> that we lived in before 19 -- in -- before 1900's, were occupied

-- a kind of a <span class="dlf">front line</span> fortification system at <span class="populated place">Verdun</span>. </sentence><sentence id="149">And probably everybody heard of that horrible battle at <span class="populated place">Verdun</span>, where more than half a million people were killed. </sentence><sentence id="150">So he did, and the Germans of course, were very appreciative, so he put him in a fr-- one morning they put him in a front of a squad that he was in and gave him German Ritterkreuz" or, or Eisern--Eisernekreuz" -- German, German decoration, because the part that he built there -- the French could not overrun it. </sentence><sentence id="151">They tried several time, they couldn't overrun it. </sentence><sentence id="152">Anyway, a few days later, he heard Polish

part of the <span class="building">fortification</span> that he built. </sentence><sentence id="156">They overran it, they kicked the Germans out  and the French gave him the Croix de Guerre".

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="272">A: There were political parties, but they were just practically two. </sentence><sentence id="273">There was the Nationalist party, which was very small and hardly anybody joined it because they were kind of chauvinistic and there was the so-called "non-party" party, which was the government party. </sentence><sentence id="274">And most people were kind of -- not exactly joining it, but supporting it, because all the politicians and all the representatives were members of that party. </sentence><sentence id="275">There was quite a lively social life. </sentence><sentence id="276">There were mostly -- mostly religious holidays and feasts that people took part in it. </sentence><sentence id="277">Like for instance, when the month of May came, every night after supper, everybody went to a little <span class="building">shrine</span> and they would be singing lot of hymns and they would sing a litany to all the saints and then you would walk <span class="building">home</span> and sing loudly. </sentence><sentence id="278">There was a fair, one or two or three religious fairs, that special preachers would come to the <span class="building">church</span> and we would walk to <span class="building">church</span> and listen to the preachers and there were <span class="spatial object">booths</span> and souvenirs toe -- <span class="spatial object">tables</span>. </sentence><sentence id="279">And <span class="spatial object">food tables</span>, where you would spend little money to get some food that you normally did not eat at <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="280">Well, every Tuesday there was a <span class="building">marketplace</span>, <span class="building">market</span> day. </sentence><sentence id="281">You would -- father would hitch a horse and we'd take some butter and eggs and some grain and some potatoes and drive to <span class="populated place">Kaluszyn</span>, where the <span class="building">market</span> took place and the people from a <span class="populated place">city</span> would -- housewife would come and buy your butter and buy your eggs. </sentence><sentence id="282">And <span class="populated place">Kaluszyn</span> was a <span class="populated place">town</span> of about 12,000 people, of whom about 10,000 were Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="283">Jewish people were merchants, they were professional, they were attorneys, they were doctors. </sentence><sentence id="284">They were <span class="building">tailors</span> and <span class="building">shoemakers</span>. </sentence><sentence id="285">And we traded with them throughout our lives. </sentence><sentence id="286">We always had a family or two or three that we're very friendly with and visited when we went there. </sentence><sentence id="287">We would start their place and maybe get a cup of tea. </sentence><sentence id="288">When they came to see us, we would give them a dozen of eggs and when they came to visit on the <span class="dlf">farm</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="306">Q: Well, how would you describe the relations in general between Jews and Poles at that time? </sentence><sentence id="307">First maybe think about your <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="308">A: In our <span class="populated place">village</span>, there was one Jewish family. </sentence><sentence id="309">It was actually first a Jewish man, only, who opened a little -- like a <span class="building">grocery</span> and needles and <span class="building">thimble store</span>. </sentence><sentence id="310">Later on he had a wife and two children. </sentence><sentence id="311">And relations were not strained. </sentence><sentence id="312">We kind of tolerated one another. </sentence><sentence id="313">All Polish Jewish people were Orthodox people. </sentence><sentence id="314">They wore special dress, they had sideburns, they had peyse(r), the long side hair. </sentence><sentence id="315">They wore gabardine coats, they wore little hats, with a -- little tiny, black hats with a tot -- little tiny visor. </sentence><sentence id="316">And they spoke very broken Polish. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="317">Q: For instance, did the children go to the <span class="building">school</span> that you went to? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="319">A: The Jewish children would go to <span class="building">public schools</span> that all of us had to go. </sentence><sentence id="320">But, they would spend little time there, but most of the time they spent was in a <span class="building">cheder</span>. </sentence><sentence id="321">There was a <span class="building">Jewish cheder</span>, they went and they learned to -- how to write Yiddish and some of them would learn Hebrew. </sentence><sentence id="322">And socially we did not have much to do together. </sentence><sentence id="323">Socially, we kept completely apart. </sentence><sentence id="324">We did not mix, or if they did, it was very little mixing between the Jewish people and Polish people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="331">Q: Did you understand why? </sentence><sentence id="332">Was that ever sort of spoken, or was that just how things were? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="335">A: That's was how the things were. </sentence><sentence id="336">It was not a -- because one hated one another, but was simply because the things were. </sentence><sentence id="337">People gravitated to their own and they did little association business-wise and also occasionally visited. </sentence><sentence id="338">For instance, we had had a--a <span class="building">Jewish peddlers</span> come. </sentence><sentence id="339">There was a Jewish lady, whose name was Golda, who came carrying a big bag and she was trading. </sentence><sentence id="340">She brought sacharyna" to sell, she brought needles, she brought thread, she brought little pieces of material. </sentence><sentence id="341">She brought occasionally a dress or two. </sentence><sentence id="342">And she would take in -- in exchange, she would take eggs and butter and some potatoes and maybe some grain. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="351">Q: Tell us a little bit more about your family and it's religious beliefs. </sentence><sentence id="352">When you were growing up, how did your parents explain those to you? </sentence><sentence id="353">Wi-Wi -- you know, in <span class="building">church</span> and that sort of thing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="357">A: We took the <span class="building">church</span> for granted. </sentence><sentence id="358">We just went to <span class="building">church</span> on Sundays. </sentence><sentence id="359">We went to religious instructions, which were taking place in <span class="building">public school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="360">Once a week, a priest or a nun would come and take a -- actually the priest or nun came every day, but took one class, for one hour we received our religious instruction. </sentence><sentence id="361">And we went to special preparation like for first communion or confirmation. </sentence><sentence id="362">We would go to <span class="building">church</span> in groups that -- which reached certain age and were prepared. </sentence><sentence id="363">We prayed at <span class="building">home</span> frequently, we would say a rosary. </sentence><sentence id="364">Probably not every day, but at least once a week. </sentence><sentence id="365">And we kids hated  it because we had to kneel for about 45 minutes on a hard <span class="interior space">floor</span>, so we squirmed and we complained, but quietly, because father did not take any guff from any kid. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="375">Q: So it was a part of your <span class="building">home</span> life and it was certainly a part of your parents beliefs? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="377">A: Very much so, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="379">Q: Was there a time, as you started to get older, that it became more something that you believed in and it wasn't that your parents were kind of asking you to do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
