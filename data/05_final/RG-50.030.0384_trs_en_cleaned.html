<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="135">A: The <span class="spatial object">ship</span> was very funny looking <span class="spatial object">ship</span>, in respect that there is, as you board the <span class="spatial object">ship</span> there is only one way of going down the <span class="spatial object">ship</span> and the <span class="spatial object">ship</span> was built sort of like <span class="interior space">cubicles</span> and in order for you to go into your <span class="interior space">bunker</span>, you had to crawl into it, there was not enough <span class="interior space">space</span> for you even to sit and we all crawled into our <span class="interior space">spaces</span> and we could not even move in the <span class="building">bunker</span>, we were so close to each other. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="147">Q: How many? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="149">A: Over 700 people. </sentence><sentence id="150">So, because we were so many, they told us we cannot go up on the <span class="interior space">deck</span>, all of us, so we were given times when we were, were, about maximum 100 people could be on <span class="interior space">deck</span>, so we took shifts when we could go on <span class="interior space">deck</span> and <span class="spatial object">toilets</span> were in, very few of them and it was just a terrible conditions. </sentence><sentence id="151">From the beginning we saw that it's, it would be worse than a <span class="building">prison</span> because the <span class="env feature">air</span> was difficult even to breathe. </sentence><sentence id="152">And yes there is one thing I would like to mention, that after we finished with the Romanian customs, then we passed through the people that organized the <span class="spatial object">vessel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="153">Now they restricted us exactly to 10 kilos of baggage. </sentence><sentence id="154">One piece, 10 kilos. </sentence><sentence id="155">Anything over that has to be left behind. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="163">Q: Are you saying that these people who restricted you were not the Romanian Customs, but the people. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="169">A: We had no choice, no time to even to ask who are you. </sentence><sentence id="170">They told , "You're going to <span class="spatial object">board</span> now, but you have to, you have to leave everything above the 10 kilos." </sentence><sentence id="171">And they had, of course, a scale. </sentence><sentence id="172">You put your <span class="spatial object">suitcase</span> on a scale. </sentence><sentence id="173">My <span class="spatial object">suitcase</span> was, if I remember correctly, something around 15 kilos. </sentence><sentence id="174">They said, "You have to unload it." </sentence><sentence id="175">So we unloaded several things and then we put back, it was 12 kilos. </sentence><sentence id="176">Unload it again until it was 10 kilos, then we were allowed to proceed. </sentence><sentence id="177">So imagine so many people waiting, waiting. </sentence><sentence id="178">So it took us forever just to embark on this <span class="spatial object">vessel</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="189">Q: Why do you think they did this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="191">A: I think they were afraid of overweight already. </sentence><sentence id="192">Already the <span class="spatial object">ship</span> was meant for less than half of the people that we were. </sentence><sentence id="193">When actually, in order to obtain more funds, they allowed more people to join, until it became 700, over 760 people. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="203">Q: How big was the crew? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="205">A: We haven't seen the crew until actually when we're all on <span class="spatial object">board</span>. </sentence><sentence id="206">We, we were told that the crew, it's a Bulgarian captain and a Bulgarian chief officer and several Bulgarian, the whole crew was a Bulgarian crew, about seven or eight people. </sentence><sentence id="207">And actually we seldom saw the, the captain altogether, but you see, we were so, so many of us, that we have, we were not manage, we were not managing even to walk around. </sentence><sentence id="208">We were glad when we were allowed to go on, on the <span class="interior space">deck</span> for a few hours just to breathe a little bit of better air. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="511">Q: And that was it, the rest of the people were gone? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="513">A: No more people. </sentence><sentence id="514">But, towards the evening I see a man, sitting on something which obviously it was a <span class="dlf">door</span>, he was sitting on the <span class="dlf">door</span> and paddling. </sentence><sentence id="515">So, he came towards me, so I pulled him up and sat him on the <span class="spatial object">bench</span>. </sentence><sentence id="516">And that was the chief officer, a Bulgarian. </sentence><sentence id="517">So he, at that time, started talking in Russian. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="523">Q: You knew Russian? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="525">A: Yes, it's my mother language. </sentence><sentence id="526">He told me that he happened to be on the <span class="interior space">deck</span> in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="527">He was the, he was on duty on <span class="interior space">deck</span>, when he saw something floating towards the <span class="spatial object">ship</span>, from the <span class="dlf">shore</span>. </sentence><sentence id="528">It was like, looked like a <span class="spatial object">torpedo</span> anyway, that was coming towards the <span class="spatial object">vessel</span>, so he run from the <span class="interior space">deck</span> towards the captain's <span class="interior space">cabin</span> and as he was opening the <span class="dlf">door</span> of the <span class="interior space">captain's cabin</span>, the explosion took him in the <span class="dlf">air</span> and when he landed in the <span class="env feature">water</span>, he landed with that <span class="dlf">door</span> in his hands, with the knob in his hands. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="567">A: All the time. </sentence><sentence id="568">Soon as the, day, day, the daylight came, I could see the <span class="env feature">shore</span> and you could  2 hear the noises of the <span class="dlf">shore</span>, like an <span class="spatial object">engine</span>, <span class="spatial object">pumping engine</span> and things like that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="571">Q: Did you think about trying to reach the <span class="env feature">shore</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="573">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="574">Then I decided, maybe I'll be able to swim to the <span class="env feature">shore</span>. </sentence><sentence id="575">So I jump into the <span class="env feature">water</span>. </sentence><sentence id="576">What happened is, if you take, from the <span class="spatial object">bench</span> and you land into the <span class="env feature">water</span>, you are much lower into the <span class="env feature">water</span>, now the <span class="dlf">shore</span> was quite far away. </sentence><sentence id="577">So I swim a little bit and I could hardly move, so I turned around and went back. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="589">A: To the <span class="spatial object">bench</span>. </sentence><sentence id="590">I was only a few yards away and I realized that the <span class="env feature">shore</span> is much further away than I thought, because of the, on the, when you are on the <span class="spatial object">bench</span>, you can see further than when you are in the <span class="env feature">water</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="593">Q: Do you remember anything about what you were thinking during that night? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="595">A: I was, knew that obviously I am going to die from drowning and I, I was not looking forward that kind of death. </sentence><sentence id="596">So I was contemplating to cut my veins or something that is a quick death. </sentence><sentence id="597">So while I was contemplating what I'm going to do next, suddenly I see quite a big <span class="spatial object">vessel</span>, fairly close, sailing in, in the, in the <span class="env feature">ocean</span>, in the <span class="env feature">sea</span>. </sentence><sentence id="598">So I looked up and I see people on <span class="interior space">deck</span> on that <span class="spatial object">vessel</span> that moving pretty fast, like a cargo, it was like a <span class="spatial object">cargo vessel</span>, with a few people there. </sentence><sentence id="599">And they were pointing towards the <span class="dlf">shore</span>, so I yelled at them, but they, they pointing toward the <span class="env feature">shore</span>. </sentence><sentence id="600">So I concluded they tell me to swim to the <span class="env feature">shore</span>, which I already tried. </sentence><sentence id="601">Anyway, the <span class="spatial object">vessel</span> goes away and then I see a <span class="spatial object">boat</span> with sailors coming towards me. </sentence><sentence id="602">So my conclusion was that that <span class="spatial object">vessel</span>, the people on the <span class="spatial object">vessel</span>, the sailors on the <span class="spatial object">vessel</span> pointed out not to the <span class="dlf">shore</span>, but that somebody's coming. </sentence><sentence id="603">Of course they came, they picked me up into the, into the <span class="spatial object">boat</span>, they pick up the chief officer and the other corpse there, all three of us on, in the, in this <span class="spatial object">boat</span> and they took us ashore. </sentence><sentence id="604">These were sailors from the <span class="building">lighthouse</span>, which you could see it and they took us into the <span class="building">lighthouse</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="615">Q: There were no more <span class="spatial object">bodies</span> on the <span class="env feature">sea</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="617">A: That's all. </sentence><sentence id="618">They picked up basically myself and two bodies. </sentence><sentence id="619">Afterwards I don't know what, whether they did pick up or not. </sentence><sentence id="620">I talked to them, but you know, it was the <span class="dlf">language barrier</span>, they speak only Turkish and I didn't have no way of communicating with them at all. </sentence><sentence id="621">But them put me on a, on a, on a <span class="spatial object">bed</span>, they gave me blankets, cover me with blankets and they gave me some food. </sentence><sentence id="622">They gave me some cheese, bread. </sentence><sentence id="623">I remember onions. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="631">Q: This was in the <span class="building">lighthouse</span>? </sentence><sentence id="632"> 3 </sentence></p></dialogue>
