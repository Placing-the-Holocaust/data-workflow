<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2135">Q: So this was the -- the end of D-Day for you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2137">A: No, not at all. </sentence><sentence id="2138">This was the beginning of D-Day. </sentence><sentence id="2139">Now, they -- we n -- we knew where the <span class="dlf">German strong points</span> were, and we were at the other end of the <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2140">Luckily, the <span class="dlf">pass</span> through the <span class="dlf">mine field</span> was at one end of <span class="populated place">Lyon sur Mer</span>, and the <span class="region">German strong point</span> was in the other. </sentence><sentence id="2141">I had no doubt where we were. </sentence><sentence id="2142">You know, we had studied the <span class="spatial object">maps</span> sufficiently. </sentence><sentence id="2143">I knew we were at the other end, we had nothing to be afraid of, not until we would get to the strong point. </sentence><sentence id="2144">Obviously the Germans are go -- going to be in their <span class="dlf">strong points</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2145">Why should they be out on the <span class="dlf">road</span>, in the <span class="populated place">French villages</span>? </sentence><sentence id="2146">The French who have murdered them, you know? </sentence><sentence id="2147">So, the first thing, I gather up a few guys, we started making our way along the <span class="dlf">road</span> that was le -- going towards the <span class="dlf">German strong point</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2148">But, you know, you -- you cannot be out in the <span class="dlf">streets</span>, I -- and -- when it -- when it comes to -- when there's so much artillery fire and mortar fire. </sentence><sentence id="2149">It's -- the splinters will carry. </sentence><sentence id="2150">So you have to go from one <span class="dlf">door</span> to the other, dive in and dive out. </sentence><sentence id="2151">And of course the population was on our side. </sentence><sentence id="2152">They willingly opened the <span class="dlf">doors</span> for us. </sentence><sentence id="2153">So I says you know, you couldn't do this in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2154">We knew that we would never be able to do this type of street fighting in <span class="country">Germany</span>, and we didn't intend to do it, and the <span class="building">British high command</span> saw to it -- had come to the same conclusion. </sentence><sentence id="2155">So we were diving from one <span class="building">house</span> into the other. </sentence><sentence id="2156">In some <span class="building">houses</span> actually there were people who had been quite badly injured, with all the bombardment by one side or the other. </sentence><sentence id="2157">In fact as -- as we got out, you know, to the <span class="dlf">road</span> first, there were some British soldiers who had obviously been killed by being out on the <span class="dlf">street</span> when the -- when a shell exploded. </sentence><sentence id="2158">You know, y-you cannot stay out under these conditions. </sentence><sentence id="2159">So we worked our way -- a few of us worked our way towards the <span class="dlf">strong point</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2160">When we got into this position where

was an anti-tank gun pointing at us down the <span class="dlf">road</span>, we got off the <span class="dlf">street</span>, we got into [indecipherable] abandoned <span class="building">houses</span>, which was quite obviously that we were now very close to the <span class="dlf">strong point</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2163">And I went <span class="interior space">upstairs</span> and tried to look out and look into the <span class="dlf">strong point</span>, but some German sniper must have seen me there, and he fired at me, but thank God he missed. </sentence><sentence id="2164">So I rushed <span class="interior space">downstairs</span> again. </sentence><sentence id="2165">I think I -- so I went down into the <span class="building">house</span>, and we were sort of milling around, deciding what to do next, when we heard a loud bang on the <span class="building">house</span> next <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2166">And ta -- so -- obviously some <span class="spatial object">missile</span> was going from our side into the <span class="dlf">strong point</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2167">So we really didn't know what the hell this was. </sentence><sentence id="2168">We were absolutely sure that apart from our -- our people there could be nobody there. </sentence><sentence id="2169">So we went there, and we found an Arab, who had the typical look of what the -- how the Germans portrayed the Jews, you know, black hair, crooked nose and all that. </sentence><sentence id="2170">And he had a 19 [indecipherable] war front loader rifle, which he somehow had gotten hold of, and he was firing this into the <span class="dlf">German strong point</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2171">So -- because nobody spoke French, ik -- yeah, my own French was very deficient in those days, I now speak French much better [indecipherable] transfer two years in the meantime. </sentence><sentence id="2172">But we persuaded him that he should join us, which he gladly did. </sentence><sentence id="2173">And he was with us for -- until the winter of 1944 -- "45. </sentence><sentence id="2174">So, after that, the colonel of the unit wanted me to go with him and look at all the different positions which the different troops of 41 commandos had now taken up around the <span class="dlf">German strong point</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2175">And I went with him. </sentence><sentence id="2176">And he was one of those guys who wouldn't take no notice of any German fire. </sentence><sentence id="2177">He was running around with a <span

-- he wouldn't throw himself down and her -- heard an artillery shell come over, and we heard a mortar come, and -- and [indecipherable] but I wasn't going to do this, so I dodged the way I'd learned

persuaded them to make a straight attack along the main <span class="dlf">road</span> to -- on -- on to the <span class="dlf">German strong point</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2184">Which was crazy. </sentence><sentence id="2185">The way we did this later on, we used <span class="spatial object">armored vehicles</span>, and even <span class="spatial object">tanks</span>, only as mobile guns. </sentence><sentence id="2186">We had them -- h-hid them somewhere in the <span class="dlf">field</span>, and had them shoot and lay down covering fire while we went in. </sentence><sentence id="2187">Anyhow, this attack totally failed. </sentence><sentence id="2188">I didn't participate in it because I knew it would -- would be practically suicide to do that. </sentence><sentence id="2189">But there was one of the troops of 41 [indecipherable] commando, Y troop, and they lost about half the troop of what they still had, in trying to do this attack, because as we knew well from our -- from the maps we had been given before D-Day, there was a German [indecipherable] <span class="spatial object">tank</span> pointing right down the <span class="dlf">road</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2190">There was no chance that an <span class="spatial object">armored car</span> could get by that. </sentence><sentence id="2191">So we hadn't -- we hadn't -- we had not

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2325">Q: Now for the rest of the war, if you could give me a sense just generally, the kind of movements where you -- where you -- you know, what kind of <span class="region">territory</span> you covered in general, and maybe there are a few things that -- that come to mind that particularly illustrate the kinds of things you were doing. </sentence><sentence id="2326">I'm also interested, especially when you were able to get Germans to surrender, were you able to learn important information from them along the way? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2329">A: I can say that important information that had strategic significance, I ca -- don't think I ever -- ever was in that position. </sentence><sentence

</sentence><sentence id="2334">Well, the -- after we -- we -- after this D-Day experience, we had a rather unique experience besieging two underground <span class="building">German radar

they were about to be attacked. </sentence><sentence id="2340">The -- the tra -- the trouble was that the allies were building -- had planned to build an air -- airp -- <span class="building">airport</span>, an air [indecipherable] abou -- only about maybe a mile away from these <span class="building">radar stations</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2341">And that plan had to go ahead, you know, there were <span class="dlf">fields</span> there that were suitable for landing <span class="spatial object">aircrafts</span> on it, and this had to go ahead. </sentence><sentence id="2342">And they couldn't take any notice of the fact that these ger -- these <span class="dlf">underground fortifications</span> were still there. </sentence><sentence id="2343">So our task was to make them believe that they were just about to be attacked. </sentence><sentence id="2344">And -- which we -- which we successfully managed to do for about a week or so. </sentence><sentence id="2345">There were a lot of adventures that we had, where we did things that were totally wrong, that you would never have done a month or two later when we had much more experience. </sentence><sentence id="2346">But luckily most of the time we were -- we got away with it. </sentence><sentence id="2347">Eventually enough <span class="spatial object">equipment</span> was saved for us -- spared for us that we could do a daylight attack on it, and -- and it was successful. </sentence><sentence id="2348">Again, I managed to get these guys out, to surrender. </sentence><sentence id="2349">So you had -- we took 450 people prisoner on -- on that day, and we marched them down to the <span class="env feature">beach</span>, to the -- t-to -- to the <span class="populated place">prisoner camps</span> of which there were there, but we shipped out. </sentence><sentence id="2350">That was an interesting experience which I've written up in great detail.
