<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2440">A: I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="2441">I can't answer that, because I n -- first I said yes, then I heard about all the war stories. </sentence><sentence id="2442">Although I did know some from Sam, his brother, and -- but I don't know if this was a determining factor or not at the time, because I didn't think it through. </sentence><sentence id="2443">So I can't tell. </sentence><sentence id="2444">But also the fact that he was Sam's brother kind of gave me a feeling that, well, you know, I make this decision -- this decision, but he can't be that bad, I mean, I know his brother. </sentence><sentence id="2445">And maybe my parents felt that way, too, because they knew Sam. </sentence><sentence id="2446">Sam worked with my father at the Jewish This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="2447">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="2448"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 4 Central Committee. </sentence><sentence id="2449">And he had high respect for Sam, and Sam for my father. </sentence><sentence id="2450">So, I mean, he probably thought, who is this guy who is gonna take my daughter to <span class="country">America</span>, you know, to the <span class="country">United States</span>? </sentence><sentence id="2451">But I think there was some kind of a feeling that he is a solid guy, and I think that helped. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2494">Q: And then, how did you make plans? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2496">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="2497">A-Also let me tell you that since we got engaged, I would receive huge bouquets of flower every single day, to the point that we had no place to put them, because you know -- and there was always a note from Isaac, you know, with every delivery of flowers. </sentence><sentence id="2498">And that was very nice. </sentence><sentence id="2499">So to get back to your question, when did we make plans. </sentence><sentence id="2500">I think it was understood that I would come to <span class="country">United

class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2507">So we went to the <span class="building">American consulate</span> to get some advice, and they told us that indeed, I could not -- I could get the scholarship, but I -- even -- I couldn't get married in the <span class="country">United States</span> and remain in the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2508">The Greek visa was oversubscribed. </sentence><sentence id="2509">So I think it was something like 10 years of waiting, or something like that, which didn't thrill me. </sentence><sentence id="2510">And one of the suggestions was that maybe I can go to <span class="country">Canada</span>, and get married in <span class="country">Canada</span>, and then for Isaac to apply for me to come from <span class="country">Canada</span> to the <span class="country">United States</span> as a spouse. </sentence><sentence id="2511">Because <span class="country">Canada</span> had no -- no quota. </sentence><sentence id="2512">So we thought about it, and thought about it, a-and we thought it might be a good idea. </sentence><sentence id="2513">My -- there was a family that we knew who had gone to <span class="populated place">Montreal</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2514">This was my brother-in-law's -- Yola's husband's cousin. </sentence><sentence id="2515">And they had moved from <span class="populated place">Athens</span> to <span class="populated place">Montreal</span> like maybe two years before that. </sentence><sentence id="2516">So Freddie, my brother-in-law, wrote to them and told them the situation, and asked them if I could stay with them while all the paperwork was being done. </sentence><sentence id="2517">And they said they would be very glad to have me there. </sentence><sentence id="2518">So that's what happened. </sentence><sentence id="2519">A friend my sister's, who was working for <span class="building">HIAS</span>, the Hebrew Immigration Society, said to me, "You know we are going to speed things up for you. </sentence><sentence id="2520">Why don't you get your police report, your health records, and everything else you need, and we'll send them to the <span class="building">consulate</span> in <span class="populated place">Montreal</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2521">So after you marry, the -- all your -- all that your husband has to do,"-- [indecipherable], "all that your husband has to do is to -- to apply for you to come to <span class="country">United States</span>, and this will save you a lot of paperwork over there." </sentence><sentence id="2522">I said fine. </sentence><sentence id="2523">So I did all this preliminary work, and Linda sent everything to <span class="populated place">Montreal</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2524">So I left in April of 58 for <span class="populated place">Montreal</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2525">It was -- didn't hit me until I was on the <span class="spatial object">plane</span>, and I said to myself, where am I going, all by myself, to somebody I don't really know. </sentence><sentence id="2526">I just wanted the <span

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5719">Q: And the distance would be so -- so painful, I think. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5721">A: Oh, it was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="5722">It was -- it was hard, because you know, I couldn't communicate other than a letter that used to take 10 days to arrive. </sentence><sentence id="5723">And <span class="spatial object">phone</span> was not so -- you know, nowadays you can call, and it doesn't cost that much. </sentence><sentence id="5724">Those days, I mean, phone calls to <span class="country">Greece</span> were very expensive, and I think we talked a couple of times on the <span class="spatial object">phone</span>, I spoke with my father, with Yola. </sentence><sentence id="5725">And everybody there were thinking how am I gonna cope with being alone here, and not having a support system. </sentence><sentence id="5726">So that was -- then on top of that, two days later, Isaac came to <span class="populated place">Washington</span> because he had an interview with <span class="building">Bellcom</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5727">And this was prearranged of course, and that interview was important, so he left and he came here. </sentence><sentence id="5728">And while he was gone, I got a call from a teacher of mine who happened to be in <span class="populated place">New York</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5729">She had no idea my mother died, but she called me just to say hello, and to say how are you doing. </sentence><sentence id="5730">And I'm saying to her -- she's calling from new -- from <span class="populated place">New York</span>, and I'm saying, you know, my mother died, and there are tears coming down [indecipherable] poor woman, I mean, she didn't know what to do over the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="5731">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="5732"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 22 phone. </sentence><sentence id="5733">So -- but that's -- it was a point of connection with somebody I knew, that I could tell some. </sentence><sentence id="5734">Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5757">Q: You must have thought about this a lot, but do you think there was any connection that we can draw between the Holocaust and your mother's sufferings, hiding, losing almost everything, and her depression and death, or do you think that perhaps -- no, you tell me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5759">A: Well, actually, I don't know, because there are a -- a lot of people who -- who went through the Holocaust and did not commit suicide. </sentence><sentence id="5760">So, you cannot pin it just on that. </sentence><sentence id="5761">I think there are many factors that go into something like this. </sentence><sentence id="5762">It's not only one thing. </sentence><sentence id="5763">You cannot say that it was just because of that, but certainly it has played -- I mean, the war and the Holocaust have played a major part in her lowt -- outlook to life. </sentence><sentence id="5764">So, you know, it's not one thing, but it definitely did have something to do with it, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="5765">But here again, there are lots of people who have gone through difficulties, or maybe even harder things, and still are alive. </sentence><sentence id="5766">So, part of it is her make-up, I think. </sentence><sentence id="5767">You know, there isn't a single answer. </sentence><sentence id="5768">There is no single answer, and that's the hardest thing in dealing with that, that you can't find an answer to say, well, I'll pinpoint that this was it. </sentence><sentence id="5769">There isn't. </sentence><sentence id="5770">It's a combination of things. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5783">Q: Now you told me about therapy when -- and -- and reading the letter from your sister telling you of your mother's suicide, but what was it that helped you come to terms with it? </sentence><sentence id="5784">Was it just accepting it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5787">A: Yeah, sure. </sentence><sentence id="5788">That it was her decision, although this is not a decision I would choose for myself, because I don't want to leave this kind of legacy to my children. </sentence><sentence id="5789">But here again, I'm a different person, other factors go into my life, so who knows? </sentence><sentence id="5790">I think time has also something to do with This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="5791">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="5792"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 23 it. </sentence><sentence id="5793">Education about the subject has a lot to do with it. </sentence><sentence id="5794">And I really have researched the subject in any possible way. </sentence><sentence id="5795">I once thought of running a group of people who survived the suicide of someone. </sentence><sentence id="5796">And then I decided maybe I wasn't ready to do that, because i have to be a little more detached from it, and I didn't feel I was that detached yet, when I wanted to do the group. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5809">Q: Tell me about the <span class="region">areas</span> that you have focused on in your work. </sentence><sentence id="5810">We really -- we've really, in these hours of interviewing, we talked about your early work in <span class="populated place">Athens</span>, and we've mentioned here and there your social work, but we've not addressed it in any detail. </sentence><sentence id="5811">We talked about your interview too, when you were -- before having your first baby, when you might have returned to doing more work then, but so we -- le -- let's go back and have you pick up how you resumed your career, as the girls were growing up. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5815">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="5816">Okay, well, as I said, I worked for the <span class="building">International Social Service</span> in <span class="populated place">New York</span> for a short period of time, a few months, which was a job I liked, and fitted me like a glove, it was perfect, because it was dealing with Greek adoptions, and people I knew from <span class="country">Greece</span> I had to communicate with. </sentence><sentence id="5817">Anyway, well after Sarah was born, I did not work any more. </sentence><sentence id="5818">I -- and after the other children were born I stayed <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5819">I was involved in <span class="building">Brownies</span>, and maybe <span class="building">school</span> activities and things like that. </sentence><sentence id="5820">Actually I did work in the evenings, when I think Nicole was in <span class="building">kindergarten</span>, for <span class="building">Garfinkels</span> -- part time -- this was my part time job. </sentence><sentence id="5821">And it was primarily because I needed to do something, and I needed to do something very part time. </sentence><sentence id="5822">But I -- I could start exploring other things. </sentence><sentence id="5823">But I always wanted to go back to social work, because this was a <span class="dlf">field</span> that always interests me. </sentence><sentence id="5824">I mean, I'm interested in people, and their lives, and what makes them tick, and what's -- how they conduct their lives, what's in their lives, what influence their lives. </sentence><sentence id="5825">So, I had a Bachelor's degree from <span class="country">Greece</span>, from <span class="building">Pierce College</span>, which was an <span class="building">American school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5826">And I knew I couldn't do very much, but when Nicole went to

place">Rockville</span>, that they were looking for a social worker at the department of aging, I think. </sentence><sentence id="5832">And I called, and verified that indeed they did need somebody, asked me to send my resume, which I did, and they called me back, they wanted me to go for an interview, which was terrific. </sentence><sentence id="5833">Well, I did go to the interview, but I went a day earlier than the interview was scheduled, like I was not anxious, I guess. </sentence><sentence id="5834">And then I realized when I'm there, because the receptionist looks at [indecipherable] says, "You know, I don't have you down for today. </sentence><sentence id="5835">I think your interview's tomorrow." </sentence><sentence id="5836">I'm protesting, I said, "No, no, it's today at 10 o'clock." </sentence><sentence id="5837">And then I realized I'm wrong, but then I'm thinking if I tell them I'm wrong, they'1l never hire me. </sentence><sentence id="5838">So anyway, the assistant director who was to interview me, Marty Moss was his name, he -- he said to me, "I thought this interview was tomorrow, but anyway since you're here, I have 10 minutes because I have to go into a meeting. </sentence><sentence id="5839">Let's just discuss a few minutes of what is available, and what you can do [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="5840">And maybe we" ll have to have a second interview at one time." </sentence><sentence id="5841">Well, he's telling me that the opening is at the <span class="building">Department of Aging</span> in the <span class="building">Jewish

</sentence><sentence id="5844">I want to work with children. </sentence><sentence id="5845">Anyway, I said okay. </sentence><sentence id="5846">And then I get a call from the chairperson of the <span

id="5848">I'm not sure. </sentence><sentence id="5849">But anyway, it was an <span class="dlf">entrance</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5850">So I think the question that really, she asked me, was -- I had done some volunteer work for the <span class="building">Jewish Community Center</span>, we were doing some kind of a woman's day, and I had chosen the older women, and I had done, you know, some -- a presentation about it, and gathered material, and we had the show, a -- a fashion show for older women, you know, because we felt they were neglected in the fashion, things like that. </sentence><sentence id="5851">Which went very well, actually. </sentence><sentence id="5852">And I was telling her </sentence></p><p><sentence id="5853"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

</sentence><sentence id="5859">And I was excited, and I thought well, I'll learn. </sentence><sentence id="5860">If I don't like it, I can always leave. </sentence><sentence id="5861">So that was how I started, and once I started working with older people, I just loved it. </sentence><sentence id="5862">I found it so rewarding. </sentence><sentence id="5863">You know, here I was, always wanted to work with children, and now I'm finding the other end of life more interesting, actually, and very rewarding. </sentence><sentence id="5864">So it was great, it was a great team to work with. </sentence><sentence id="5865">It was a good a -- very good <span class="building">agency</span>, very good camaraderie and professionalism. </sentence><sentence id="5866">And I enjoy every minute of it, and I stayed there. </sentence><sentence id="5867">I think I started in "74, and stayed until 1990. </sentence><sentence id="5868">That's a long time. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="5869">And while I was working there -- I always wanted to do therapy, and I had taken some courses, and then while I was at the <span class="building">Jewish Social Service</span>, the -- my department chair said, "Paulette, you've got to get your Master's degree. </sentence><sentence id="5870">You are doing things that Master's degree social workers are doing, but we can't pay you as a Master's degree social worker." </sentence><sentence id="5871">So finally I thought about it, and thought about it, and I've never been to an <span class="building">American university</span>, I was 49 years old. </sentence><sentence id="5872">So when I told a friend, I said, "I'm 49, how am I gonna go to <span class="building">school</span>?" </sentence><sentence id="5873">She said, "You'll be 49 whether you go or not, just go." </sentence><sentence id="5874">So finally I talked it over with Isaac, I said I would need a lot of help. </sentence><sentence id="5875">This was a time that Maya had started driving, and she said, "I'll help, I'll help, I'll do all your [indecipherable] driving for you." </sentence><sentence id="5876">So everybody pitched in and I did go to <span
