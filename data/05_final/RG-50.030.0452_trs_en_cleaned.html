<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="124">A: No, we did not hear. </sentence><sentence id="125">We were pretty ignorant. </sentence><sentence id="126">We never felt anything. </sentence><sentence id="127">When the Italians came, they sent two groups of officers -- Italian military -- at some point in time. </sentence><sentence id="128">But we never felt anything because the Italians always behaved very well toward us. </sentence><sentence id="129">I said before that we were not supposed to go to <span class="building">school</span> when the racial laws started, but the Italians were very apologetic to us. </sentence><sentence id="130">They told us that those were the rules that they had received and unfortunately they had to apply them at some point in time. </sentence><sentence id="131">Not at the beginning, but at some point they were obliged to. </sentence><sentence id="132">And also some of the Jews belonged to <span class="building">clubs</span> -- you know, an Italian circle of <span class="building">clubs</span>, and we were excluded from them at that time also. </sentence><sentence id="133">But the Italians were again apologetic about that. </sentence><sentence id="134">They said they were obliged to do it because of some rules they had received from the <span class="region">mainland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="135">Generally, we had normal life even after racial laws. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="148">Q: What year did the racial laws go into effect in your <span class="region">area</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="150">A: At the beginning the racial laws were-- besides not going to <span class="building">school</span> and the <span class="building">club</span> -- being excluded from the club--- the attitude between the Italian officers and the Jewish population was the same, because the <span class="env feature">islands</span> and the group was very small, so everybody knew everybody. </sentence><sentence id="151">And the Italian behavior stayed the same. </sentence><sentence id="152">It's only after the attempt on Hitler's life, that things got tougher because of the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="153">That was on July 20, 1944. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="158">Q: I think I forgot my question. </sentence><sentence id="159">I think I understand that it wasn't a drastic change of lifestyle when the racial laws were implemented. </sentence><sentence id="160">However, I'm wondering if you and your family, or others in the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span> were talking about this and very concerned about this. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="164">A: We had news, in some of the Italian newspapers, but since it was so far away, we thought, you know, we were not concerned. </sentence><sentence id="165">We were very isolated in the <span class="env feature">islands</span> and even the attitude of the Italian officers was very relaxed, so we wouldn't think that something was really happening to us. </sentence><sentence id="166">That's why we were not as concerned. </sentence><sentence id="167">The situation worsened when Badoglio, who was marshal in the Italian army, and the king, Vittorio Emmanuel the Third, when they asked for the armistice with the Allies. </sentence><sentence id="168">And at that time, things got a little tougher. </sentence><sentence id="169">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="170">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="171"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection At that time, when the Germans saw that the Italians were asking for the armistice and they got it, they felt they were betrayed by the Italians. </sentence><sentence id="172">At that point in time, they sent some troops to the <span class="env feature">islands</span>. </sentence><sentence id="173">It was only nine months before our eventual deportation that at some point in time the Germans, after seeing what the Italians did, sent more troops to the <span class="env feature">islands</span>. </sentence><sentence id="174">But the local population was not aware of anything, and even the Germans that were on the <span class="env feature">island</span> were acting very normal and polite with all the population. </sentence><sentence id="175">We did not know, but in the meantime, they had taken all the information on Jewish families. </sentence><sentence id="176">They took all the addresses and knew who was living where and they already had all the information on Jews. </sentence><sentence id="177">They were not showing anything, but they had already started. </sentence><sentence id="178">German troops came to <span class="populated place">Rhodes</span> on September 8, 1943.At some point, after the armistice, the Germans had their <span class="building">headquarters</span> in <span class="populated place">Rhodes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="179">And at that point, they called all the Italian officers and told them, "Your king and the Marshal Badoglio have asked for armistice, so what are you going to do?" </sentence><sentence id="180">And at that point, the Germans told the Italian officers that they were German prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="181">But the officers stayed on the <span class="env feature">island</span>. </sentence><sentence id="182">They were not supposed to leave the <span class="env feature">island</span>, but they were not put as a military officer in <span class="building">prison</span>, they were just free to stay on the <span class="env feature">island</span> at that time. </sentence><sentence id="183">Therefore, the Jews were registered, but we knew nothing about what was going on in <span class="country">Europe</span>. </sentence><sentence id="184">At the moment of the armistice, when the British saw that the Italians were joining the Allies, they tried to land in <span class="populated place">Kos</span>. </sentence><sentence id="185">But the Germans had sent some <span class="spatial object">boats</span> from <span class="populated place">Rhodes</span> to bomb them. </sentence><sentence id="186">And then the British tried to land in <span class="populated place">Rhodes</span>, but they couldn't succeed, so they had to retreat. </sentence><sentence id="187">And so we stayed. </sentence><sentence id="188">And the Jewish population and the rest of the population stayed in <span class="populated place">Kos</span>. </sentence><sentence id="189">The Italians didn't say anything and maybe didn't know anything about the plans of the Germans, but at some point, the Germans that were on the <span class="env feature">islands</span> of course, told the population of <span class="populated place">Kos</span> that if they wanted to leave, they could leave. </sentence><sentence id="190">This was because we were going to run out of food because the <span class="env feature">island</span> was kind of isolated. </sentence><sentence id="191">It was surrounded by the <span class="spatial object">British submarines</span>, and we had difficulty finding food. </sentence><sentence id="192">So they had asked the population of <span class="populated place">Kos</span> if any of us wanted to leave the <span class="env feature">island</span> and go to <span class="country">Turkey</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="224">Q: Did you or your family express interest in leaving? </sentence><sentence id="225">Did you know people personally -- people in the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span> -- who were leaving? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="228">A: My father said leaving was not necessary. </sentence><sentence id="229">He thought the war would end soon. </sentence><sentence id="230">Maybe a couple of people left the <span class="env feature">island</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="231"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="232">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="233"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="234">Q: At this point, before you were deported of course, is there any stage where you were really starting to feel fear? </sentence><sentence id="235">You or your family? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="236">A: We had no fear because we had, at some point... The British had bombed a few times, but we were not afraid because we were thinking that the war was about to end. </sentence><sentence id="237">So we said it's not the time to be afraid, and we are far away. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="240">Q: Did you hear about the war in other places -- in Europe for instance? </sentence><sentence id="241">Did you even... When did you know that the war had started -- in September of 1939? </sentence><sentence id="242">When did you learn about those events? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="246">A: We were not aware, because in a certain way, we knew about the war, but we were not very concerned. </sentence><sentence id="247">And then, unfortunately, I feel bad about the ignorance, but we had no more radios, but more than that-- that was not an excuse, but more than that it's because we saw the Italians around us who were not concerned, so we didn't know why we would be concerned. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="250">Q: I wanted to ask a little bit more about the racial laws and to get a little more detail on what you recall you had to do differently because of the laws. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="252">A: The Italians never made us feel that there was a difference. </sentence><sentence id="253">We thought that we had to stop going to <span class="building">school</span> because of the war and that's how it was. </sentence><sentence id="254">We thought we'd be able to go back after the war was over. </sentence><sentence id="255">Tape 1, <span class="interior space">Side B</span> </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="260">Q: We were last talking about the racial laws and I want to make sure we have the chronology of events correct. </sentence><sentence id="261">So I want to establish exactly when it was when you no longer could go to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="264">A: We could no longer go to <span class="building">school</span> after 1938. </sentence><sentence id="265">I had done quite a bit of <span class="building">secondary school</span>, so it was not hard for me. </sentence><sentence id="266">But small children had to go <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="270">Q: What exactly did you do every day after you no longer were in <span class="building">school</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="272">A: I was <span class="building">home</span> with the family. </sentence><sentence id="273">I was still going to take piano lessons because I had started at the <span class="building">nun's school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="274">I started when I was three years old and kept on taking piano lessons with the sister who was giving piano lessons. </sentence><sentence id="275">The sister wanted me also to help out with other small children and give them some lessons in <span class="spatial object">piano</span>. </sentence><sentence id="276">These were not Jewish children. </sentence><sentence id="277">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="278">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="279"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="288">Q: And then we were also talking about the possibility for people to leave the island of <span class="populated place">Kos</span> and go to <span class="country">Turkey</span>. </sentence><sentence id="289">Could we establish exactly when you learned about this in relationship to the racial laws and other events? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="292">A: We were not-- The Germans were not treating us the way they treated Jews in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="293">We didn't have to wear the star; we didn't have <span class="populated place">ghettos</span>. </sentence><sentence id="294">And the Germans would come to my father's <span class="building">store</span>, buy merchandise, pay and be well-behaved. </sentence><sentence id="295">They were not aggressive to us. </sentence><sentence id="296">At one point, one of my father's employees said, "Since we have this <span class="spatial object">boat</span> that we use to do commerce in the <span class="env feature">islands</span>, why don't we put all our merchandise and things out of your <span class="building">house</span> onto the <span class="spatial object">boat</span> and bring them to <span class="country">Turkey</span>?" </sentence><sentence id="297">The employee had asked also that my only brother that remained in <span class="populated place">Rhodes</span> -- not the ones who had left, but the only remaining brother, the youngest one -- he would go with this boat captain to <span class="country">Turkey</span> and establish maybe a <span class="building">business</span> on the other side, or start a life on the other side. </sentence><sentence id="298">This was winter 1943-44. </sentence><sentence id="299"><span class="populated place">Kos</span> to <span class="country">Turkey</span> was only 4 km. </sentence><sentence id="300">But my father said, "No, the war will end soon." </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="301">Q: At the time of this event of mentioning your brother and this German, was he actually a soldier? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="302">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="303">He was not a German; he was a Greek captain who was working for my father in February or March of 1944. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="306">Q: And how old were you about this time and how active are you in any of the decision making in your <span class="building">household</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="314">Q: Did the sisters talk to you about the problems? </sentence><sentence id="315">Did they give you advice? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="318">A: The nuns did not know. </sentence><sentence id="319">The sisters of the <span class="building">school</span> had no idea about what was going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="320">It was only at the moment of the deportation when the Germans arrested us, that one of the sisters in charge of the <span class="building">school</span>, the Mother Superior, came and said to the Germans that my mother was sick and was not very well and if she could stay because she had to get treatment and then they would send her afterward. </sentence><sentence id="321">But she was thinking of sending my mother to <span class="country">Turkey</span> instead. </sentence><sentence id="322">But my mother did not agree to stay behind...

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="354">Q: Did you hear much about what was happening on the mainland of <span class="country">Greece</span>? </sentence><sentence id="355">Specifically, I believe there were other deportations of Jews in 1943. </sentence><sentence id="356">Did you hear anything about that? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="364">Q: I want to go back just for a moment, because some of the reading I had done, I had seen something about actually this is not during the war but back to 1933, something about there being an earthquake on the island of <span class="populated place">Kos</span> and actually the <span class="building">synagogue</span> being destroyed. </sentence><sentence id="365">I was wondering if that affected you or your family of if you remember if this is right? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="951">Q: Were you able to carry on any cultural or religious activities at all? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="953">A: We didn't do anything, but we were really amazed to see that there were some Ashkenazi women, who were there for maybe two or three years, and every Friday were taking a little bit of the margarine they were receiving, and they were melting it down and then tried to do a little candle, and light it, and they were crying. </sentence><sentence id="954">And every week, they were doing that and I was amazed that they were doing that. </sentence><sentence id="955">They were organized. </sentence><sentence id="956">And also in order to make some kind of a candle, they were ripping little threads from blankets and they were using that to do the candles. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="961">Q: You never actually participated? </sentence><sentence id="962">You saw this but you weren't involved personally? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="965">A: Since the women had been in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> for a long time, the women had the habit of doing that. </sentence><sentence id="966">But for us, we admired them that even in those kind of moments, they were doing this. </sentence><sentence id="967">But we were overwhelmed. </sentence><sentence id="968">But we had a kind of admiration for them. </sentence><sentence id="969">The difference was that since the Ashkenazi people were more religious, they had lived mainly in <span class="building">Jewish circles</span>. </sentence><sentence id="970">And they were coming either from <span class="country">Poland</span> or <span class="country">Russia</span> or other <span class="country">countries</span>, and they had been living more in isolation, so they were in a closer society and they were used to being among all Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="971">The difference with the Sephardic Jews was that we were more integrated into the rest of the culture and population and various religions. </sentence><sentence id="972">So yes, they were Jewish and they were doing the traditional Jewish observance. </sentence><sentence id="973">But we were not as close to the religion as were these people coming from smaller <span class="populated place">villages</span>. </sentence><sentence id="974">And also because those Jewish people were put into <span class="populated place">ghettos</span> and were obliged to be isolated and interact only with each other. </sentence><sentence id="975">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="976">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="977"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="991">Q: So I'm not sure how you might be able to answer this if you weren't really seeing other men prisoners, but I'm interested in the differences between how women and men were treated in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="992">I don't know if you have any perspective? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="995">A: The work that was given to men was a lot harder and more difficult. </sentence><sentence id="996">They were going to <span class="dlf">mines</span> and they would carry two great stones, so they had a much harder life in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> and also, of the survivors that came out of our group, most are women. </sentence><sentence id="997">There are maybe only five or six men of the 150 that survived. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1001">Q: I think that I saw, or I think I remember in what you were saying before, something about contact you yourself had with SS or with <span class="spatial object">kapos</span> or, you know, other, and I was wondering if there is anything else you didn't' say about your personal interaction with those people? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1003">A: An extraordinary thing happened to me when I was in <span class="populated place">Landsberg</span>, <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1004">I was working at the time in the <span class="interior space">washing rooms</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1005">There were four women in the <span class="interior

were obliged to wash about 60 blankets a day. </sentence><sentence id="1006">I was washing then. </sentence><sentence id="1007">And at some point in time, there was an officer that came in with other

doing an inspection." </sentence><sentence id="1010">And this officer, at some point in time, looked at me and asked in French, "Where are you coming from?" </sentence><sentence id="1011">So I said,

id="1012">I was then in <span class="populated place">Landsberg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1013">And the officer asked, "Where are your parents?" </sentence><sentence id="1014">And then I said, "They stayed in... they stayed in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>." </sentence><sentence id="1015">And then after that he asked if I wanted to work in the <span class="interior

id="1018">Then he looked at me and he said, "I can see from your hands," because I still had good hands at the time. </sentence><sentence id="1019">Then he asked if I wanted to work in the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1020">The <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> was the best place to work, because there was food and it was warm. </sentence><sentence id="1021">So I said, "Oh, yes." </sentence><sentence id="1022">Then he left. </sentence><sentence id="1023">And that evening he sent a prisoner, a guy from <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>, who came over and gave me a pack with sugar and salami and some margarine and bread and he said, "Don't say anything. </sentence><sentence id="1024">This is the officer sending you that." </sentence><sentence id="1025">And for a few days, every day he sent that with the prisoner and then at some point in time, the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> chief (an older political prisoner interned in 1933) came and said, "You come here. </sentence><sentence id="1026">I received orders that you are to work in the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>." </sentence><sentence id="1027">And later on, I saw the officer. </sentence><sentence id="1028">He was a doctor and he was working at the <span class="building">hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1029">I tried to smile to him, but he put a finger on his mouth and he kind of made a sign not to say a word about it. </sentence><sentence id="1030">And so I worked in the <span class="interior

place to be, but also, a few days after I left the <span class="spatial object">laundry</span> to begin working in the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>, they closed the <span

all died. </sentence><sentence id="1034">So I was really lucky This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1035">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked
