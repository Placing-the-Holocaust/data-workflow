<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1229">A: As I said, the sanitary conditions and the hunger was very bad and this was 1943, winter. </sentence><sentence id="1230">Was very hard winter and the Germans allowed the people from the <span class="building">barrack</span>, they should volunteer to go into the <span class="env feature">woods</span> - it was a <span class="env feature">forest</span> actually behind the behind the <span class="populated place">camp</span> and gather twigs for the <span class="spatial object">stove</span> in the - we had one <span

object">train</span> in <span class="populated place">Celle</span>, the <span class="populated place">town</span> of <span class="populated place">Celle</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1240">I was lagging behind. </sentence><sentence id="1241">My mother was afraid that as I stayed behind the Germans would shoot me. </sentence><sentence id="1242">Who needs, you know, who needs me. </sentence><sentence id="1243">But I made it. </sentence><sentence id="1244">As soon as we came to the <span class="spatial object">train</span> I lied myself down on top of the <span class="spatial

started to rerouting, back and forth. </sentence><sentence id="1251">We are going in circles for ten days. </sentence><sentence id="1252">We couldn't get through because the Allies were on all sides.

the <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1256">And while the bombings were going on, the wave after wave of <span class="spatial object">planes</span>, we went underneath the <span class="spatial object">train</span> to hide. </sentence><sentence id="1257">A lot would help if the bombs would drop. </sentence><sentence id="1258">And the commandant, not knowing what to do, he went to the next <span class="populated place">village</span> to call up <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1259">He told us where he is going.

kissing his feet. </sentence><sentence id="1290">The soldier started crying and he told us that President Roosevelt died. </sentence><sentence id="1291">It was the 13th of April, 1945.
