<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="11">Q: Tell me a little bit about your family and your life before the war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="13">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="14">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="15">My father, whose name was -- was Adolf, nothing -- no relation to the notorious Adolf, wa-was a businessman, he had inherited a grain export business from his father. </sentence><sentence id="16">And in addition to that he had a -- a partnership in a <span class="building">grain mill</span>, and for awhile he also had leased a number of <span class="building">movie theaters</span>, which was very nice for us because we could go to the movies for free. </sentence><sentence id="17">And he -- h-he was fairly wealthy, but the depression affected his <span class="building">business</span> a lot and the income went way down and we found it necessary to move into a much smaller <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, actually in the <span class="building">house</span> of my grandmother. </sentence><sentence id="18">And so we had to live on a very limited budget for a number of years during the depression years. </sentence><sentence id="19">My mother was a v -- a very attractive woman. </sentence><sentence id="20">Her parents had -- well, her f-father was born in <span class="populated place">Libau</span>, her mother actually came from <span class="populated place">Mitau</span>, which was the capital of the former <span class="region">Duchy of Courland</span>, and her family, I think, had lived in <span class="country">Latvia</span> for quite a few generations. </sentence><sentence id="21">My mother was the youngest of three daughters, had -- they also had a son. </sentence><sentence id="22">Her father, again, was fairly prosperous before World War I, but then, with the German troops advancing into <span class="country">Latvia</span>, decided to flee to <span class="populated place">Saint Petersburg</span>, and somehow during the war and revolution, managed to lose all his money, so he came back almost penniless, and somehow the -- the family never recovered, th-they lived rather modestly. </sentence><sentence id="23">Okay, about my childhood, yes, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="24">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="25"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection in the early years, we lived in a -- in a comfortable <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, my brother and I each had a -- a governess, and as -- which was the custom in those days. </sentence><sentence id="26">Our family was somewhat Germanized, like many of the e-educated Jews in -- in <span class="populated place">Courland</span> and sort of <span class="region">western Latvia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="27">My parents had gone to <span class="building">Russian schools</span> so they would often speak Russian to one another when they didn't want us children to understand. </sentence><sentence id="28">But the rest of time we all spoke German. </sentence><sentence id="29">And I never learned to speak Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="30">My father could, my -- my mother could also speak it, but not quite as fluently. </sentence><sentence id="31">And we -- my -- my brother was t -- his name was George, was two years old than I. My father was rather partial to his oldest son, which of -- in the early years was a bit of a problem for me, but in -- eventually, I think shortly before he died, he began to treat us equally. </sentence><sentence id="32">Okay, maybe you can ask me another question. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="55">Q: Did -- was your family religious? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="57">A: My mother was fairly religious. </sentence><sentence id="58">We certainly observed the major holidays, usually went to our grandparents or had a Seder in our own <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="59">Usually at the grandparents. </sentence><sentence id="60">My father, for some reason, had quit the <span class="building">Jewish temple</span>, it -- it doesn't mean that he totally abandoned the religion, there -- I think there were some quasi-political differences. </sentence><sentence id="61">My paternal grandfather actually was a -- a gabbai of the <span class="building">local temple</span> was apparently a highly regarded member of the congregation. </sentence><sentence id="62">And then when -- as -- as I approached the Bar Mitzvah -- both my brother and I had Bar Mitzvah and for me that's -- marked the beginning of a religious period, and I was -- was very religious, said all the prayers and did all the right things and so on. </sentence><sentence id="63">That process was s - - SS -- stopped by the war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="71">Q: What was the <span class="building">Jewish community</span> in <span class="populated place">Liepaja</span> like? </sentence><sentence id="72">Was it -- was it a large <span class="populated place">community</span>? </sentence><sentence id="73">Were you involved with it? </sentence><sentence id="74">Did you go to a <span class="building">religious school</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="79"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="80">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="81"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="82">A: No, the <span class="populated place">community</span> was relatively large, it was about 12 percent of the population of <span class="populated place">town</span>, maybe se -- 7,000 people. </sentence><sentence id="83">I was v -- during my religious phase I certainly went to the <span class="building">temple</span> on ho -- high holidays and possibly some of the lesser holidays. </sentence><sentence id="84">We also celebrated Succos, for example, and Purim. </sentence><sentence id="85">But I was too young to be involved in the religious life and my father simply wouldn't participate in it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="90">Q: I'm trying to get a sense of if your friends were Jewish, if your friends were mixed, did you go to a <span class="building">public school</span>, and that sort of -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="91">A: I -- the first <span class="building">school</span> I went to was a <span class="building">German school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="92">The -- at that time -- it was 1931, I think, the <span class="dlf">street</span> signs in <span class="country">Latvia</span> were still in three languages, Latvian, German and Russian and German was still -- a-and both German and Russian were still considered acceptable languages, although the Latvian government emphasi -- tried to emphasize Latvian. </sentence><sentence id="93">We went to a <span class="building">German school</span>, and then [indecipherable] I stayed there until spring of "32. </sentence><sentence id="94">Hitler had not yet come to power in <span class="country">Germany</span>, but it was clearly -- he was on the rise, and there was a perception that anti-Semitism was going to get worse in <span class="country">Germany</span>, and in the <span class="populated place">German community</span>, so my parents decided to take me out of there. </sentence><sentence id="95">They also decided to put me in a <span class="building">Latvian public school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="96">I understand that only about 10 percent of the Jewish children went to <span class="building">Latvian schools</span>, the others went to -- to na - - <span class="building">Jewish schools</span>. </sentence><sentence id="97">I was quite aloof, found it difficult to make friends. </sentence><sentence id="98">I never had more than two close friends. </sentence><sentence id="99">Often they were -- were Latvian, because there were relatively few Jewish children in the <span class="building">school</span> and I'm not sure I would have given them preference anyway. </sentence><sentence id="100">But in -- especially in -- in <span class="building">high school</span> my -- the last two years that I went to <span class="building">school</span>, my -- my best friend actually was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="101">I should say something about him, per-perhaps later on. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="102">Q: Did you have a lot of contact with non-Jewish Latvians, your neighbors, or -- I mean, did -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="104"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="105">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="106"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="107">A: Yes, usually I had some Latvian friends and since I had very few friends, they generally were the close friends. </sentence><sentence id="108">So I did have a fair amount of contact with them. </sentence><sentence id="109">The neighbors again, I don't think we had any Jewish neighbors in the <span class="building">building</span>, or perhaps there were some next <span class="dlf">door</span>, but I -- I don't remember any. </sentence><sentence id="110">So we had contact mainly with -- with Latvians. </sentence><sentence id="111">But my father, of course, had a lot of business contacts with the local Jewish community and my wife -- my -- not my wife, my mother had s-some Jewish friends as well as a number of -- of Gentile friends. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="117">Q: Were you aware of anti-Semitism as this point in your life? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="119">A: ["ve sort of been giving myself a push lately to think about it and try to remember it. </sentence><sentence id="120">And the worst thing that I can remember happened to me in <span class="building">school</span>, all the years that I went to a <span class="building">Latvian school</span>, is that a few times one of the other boys would f-fold a piece of cloth so it remember -- resemb -- remem -- sorry, resembled a pig's ear and sort of pointed it at me as if to taunt me that I was a Jew and we were not allowed to -- to eat pork. </sentence><sentence id="121">And that was the worst thing that ever happened to me. </sentence><sentence id="122">I don't recall ever being called bad names, or getting into fights because I was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="123">Children generally are -- tend to be fairly cruel and s-s -- I'm s -- tend to torment minorities, but I experienced very little of that. </sentence><sentence id="124">And my general perception was, a-again, in part triggered by Ezergailis" book, who tries to show that <span class="country">Latvia</span> wasn't any more anti-Semitic than other <span class="country">European countries</span>. </sentence><sentence id="125">Frankly, from all the details I remember, I must give him right. </sentence><sentence id="126">And one of the anti-Semitic actions I do remember is that my father's <span class="building">grain mill</span> was nationalized with inadequate compensation, and I thought this was of an anti-Jewish act. </sentence><sentence id="127">Ezergailis points out that actually a number of non-Jewish businesses were also nationalized, and the intent was not so much to drive the Jews out of business, because in some <span class="building">branches</span> the Jews were left unmolested. </sentence><sentence id="128">It's just that the government, which patterned itself Mussolini's <span class="country">Italy</span>, wanted to sort of nati -- to get state ownership of certain branches of business and industry. </sentence><sentence id="129">And if there happened to be This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="130">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="131"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection some Jewish companies in the way, they were nationalized. </sentence><sentence id="132">And in other <span class="region">areas</span>, where they didn't seem to care at -- at the time, they left the Jews alone. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="149">Q: Youw're talking about the Latvian government? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="151">A: The Latvian government, yes, yes, we're still in this, the pre-war era. </sentence><sentence id="152">So the anti-Semitism definitely was -- was not bad, and I think another fact is, of course that a number of German Jewish refugees came to <span class="country">Latvia</span> and established themselves and felt reasonably comfortable. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="155">Q: They came because of Hitler? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="157">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="159">Q: Okay, so you had a fair amount of knowledge about what was going on in <span class="country">Germany</span> -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="160">A: Yes, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="161">Q: -- prior to his occupation? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="163">A: We were quite well informed. </sentence><sentence id="164">We would regularly listen to -- to the <span class="building">BBC</span>, to German broadcasts and we -- as long as it was possible we subscribed to a Swiss political weekly that wa -- called the [indecipherable], which at that time was quite famous for being anti-Nazi, and the editor-in-chief was very outspoken and very critical of Hitler and we sort of enjoyed reading his editorials just because he would mince no words. </sentence><sentence id="165">And I thought we were quite well informed, until 19 -- June 1940 when of course the -- the s -- Soviets took over <span class="country">Latvia</span> and cut off the supply of foreign newspapers. </sentence><sentence id="166">We also subscribed to some German magazines. </sentence><sentence id="167">So I think we were well informed, but we heard only a few sporadic reports about atrocities, even after the outbreak of the war in <span class="country">Poland</span>, and the famous [indecipherable] Kristallnacht, and of course that was supposed to be in retaliation for the assassination of a German diplomat, and we did hear there were excesses. </sentence><sentence id="168">But we didn't realize how many killings there had been, we heard about property damage and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="169">And we thought, well this is sort of an isolated incident, it's a This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="170">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="171"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection shame that it happened. </sentence><sentence id="172">But somehow we weren't prepared to change my family's and many other Jew's perception of ger -- of the Germans being basically fair. </sentence><sentence id="173">Maybe they were very strict with Jews, they were depriving them of some civil rights, but we thought that by and large there was -- you pretty much got what you deserved. </sentence><sentence id="174">We thought that they would be discriminating in their treatment of -- of Jews, Jews who in their eyes had conducted themselves badly, or had harmed German interests would of -- would of course be persecuted, and Jews that had been -- had not done so would presumably be judged on their merits. </sentence><sentence id="175">Th-That -- that was the notion we had, and I think there is perhaps another indication of that, that when the w -- the war broke out, and <span class="country">Germany</span> attacked <span class="country">Russia</span>, only about a quarter of the Jews from <span class="country">Latvia</span> fled with the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="176">In my family, out of 27 people, only two fled. </sentence><sentence id="177">The o -- the others all stayed, which means they felt that th-the Germans were the lesser evil. </sentence><sentence id="178">So we -- there was just a further factor, namely the Latvian government was trying to keep good relations with both the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span> and <span class="country">Nazi Germany</span>, and this means that they purposely suppressed any kind of derogatory, unfavorable news about th-the Germans an-and the Russians, so we didn't learn as much about some of the atrocities were going on in -- say in <span class="country">Poland</span>, a-as we should have. </sentence><sentence id="179">And -- but BBC again didn't report anything, so we -- we had the impression that there were just some small scale atrocities, but nothing major, and sort of isolated. </sentence><sentence id="180">And furthermore, the final solution had not yet started, because there certainly wasn't -- th-the systematic large scale killing of Jews only started with the attack on <span class="country">Russia</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="200">Q: You started to mention the Russian occupation. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="202">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="203">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="204">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="205"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="210">Q: Why don't you talk a little bit about that, your memories of what happened when the Russians came in, whether there was support for the Russians, whether there was local resistance, and what -- and how that changed your life. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="212">A: Well, the first encounter with the Russians came on October "39, when under the Molotov- Ribbentrop Pact, they demanded <span class="building">military bases</span> from the Latvian government, including a large <span class="building">base</span> in my <span class="populated place">hometown</span>, which had been the principle <span class="building">naval port</span> of the Tsarist empire. </sentence><sentence id="213">In fact, the Russian navy that -- th-the fleet that sailed around -- halfway around the world to fight the Japanese in the Russian Japanese war of 1904 started in <span class="populated place">Libau</span>. </sentence><sentence id="214">So, they had a large -- established a large <span class="building">Russian garrison</span> in -- in <span class="populated place">Libau</span> and the <span class="populated place">town</span> was full of Russian soldiers, and in the f -- as a kid, at first it's a little exciting to see all these strange uniforms and so on, but we soon learned that these were really quite unwelcome people. </sentence><sentence id="215">The population I -- I had a summer job at the time and -- at a <span class="building">carpenter's shop</span>, and some of the workers were rather pleased, they were -- <span class="populated place">Libau</span> was a somewhat leftist <span class="populated place">town</span> and the workers, well [indecipherable] sort of glad that they now the -- the workers are going to own everything, and the government will -- will take from the rich and give to the poor and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="216">So a number of them were sympathetic. </sentence><sentence id="217">I met some of these same workers months later and they were furious because they realized that all these promises had been broken with -- they were -- for example, there were signs up in the <span class="spatial object">streetcars</span>, just, the <span class="spatial object">streetcars</span> now belong to you. </sentence><sentence id="218">Well hell, you still had to pay. </sentence><sentence id="219">And all -- all the other things, practically everything in the economy had changed for the worse and all these promises simply had not been delivered. </sentence><sentence id="220">And a large part of the reason for that was that <span class="country">Latvia</span> was part of Europe and had a much higher living standard than <span class="country">Russia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="221">And so when it was annexed to -- to <span class="country">Russia</span>, they had to level everything. </sentence><sentence id="222">And the way they did it is they raised prices to s -- to Soviet levels and they raised -- which in some cases was 10 to 30 fold, and they raised wages maybe This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="223">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="224"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection double or so, but in -- in -- the net effect was still that the purchasing power, it was very much less. </sentence><sentence id="225">And in turns -- for the Russian soldiers this was still paradise. </sentence><sentence id="226">They would sort of -- crowded the <span class="building">shops</span> and buy everything they c -- they saw for their rubles. </sentence><sentence id="227">So the disenchantment set in very quickly with many people, but there still was a hard core of Latvians, and I wou -- must -- must say also, a number of Jews who in the past had leftist political sympathies, either social democrats, who were, of course, banned at the time, or -- and were the enemies of both the Latvian government and the communists, or communists. </sentence><sentence id="228">Those people were glad they s -- their excuse was well maybe things are not working perfectly, cause we're building a New World order and -- and creating a new type of man, Soviet man and everything is going to be alright and it's going to be much better than you could ever dream of. </sentence><sentence id="229">So these people were still true believers, but a lot of people were disenchanted. </sentence><sentence id="230">And certainly we were, because we were the bourgeois, as they would call them, we were s-suddenly the enemies of -- class enemies. </sentence><sentence id="231">The Russians expropriated my father's <span class="building">business</span>. </sentence><sentence id="232">He was a-allowed to keep his debts, but he -- all the assets were taken away from him. </sentence><sentence id="233">And in general there were lots of restrictions. </sentence><sentence id="234">For instance, they decreed that every person was entitled to only nine square meters of <span class="interior space">living space</span>, with some sort of allowances for -- which means most people had to -- to sublet -- to rent <span class="interior space">rooms</span> to their <span class="building">apartments</span>. </sentence><sentence id="235">And there were some allowances made if -- if you rented or -- a <span class="interior space">room</span> that was accessible only through another <span class="interior space">room</span>, then this other <span class="interior space">room</span> didn't count fully, you could still keep that because you lost your privacy, your roomer would always walk through that other <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="236">So we were forced to rent our -- a couple of <span class="interior space">rooms</span> in our <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="237">And as it turned out th -- these were two people from the <span class="building">border guards</span>, which was a branch of the Russian security apparatus that was not identical to but closely allied to the KGB, and they were later involved in deportation. </sentence><sentence id="238">One of the men was -- was actually a Jew, Kleinman, and he moved out after This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="239">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="240"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection awhile. </sentence><sentence id="241">And the other one was a -- an ethnic Russian from -- from <span class="country">Latvia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="242">Sort of a young, rather innocuous looking man who sort of rent the <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, and was just w-wearing civilian clothes and then one day instead of opening the <span class="dlf">door</span> with his key, about a month or two later he rang the <span class="dlf">doorbell</span>, and my mother opened the <span class="dlf">door</span> and she saw this large man in a Russian major's uniform and at first she didn't recognize him, she was scared. </sentence><sentence id="243">He was proudly showing off his new uniform. </sentence><sentence id="244">Well, he is actually the man who saved us from deportation to <span class="country">Russia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="245">What happened is that a week before the outbreak of the German Russian war, the Russians went to a number of <span class="building">homes</span> in the middle of the night, sort of got the people out of <span class="spatial object">bed</span>, told them get dressed, pack your -- your bags, and come with us, get on the <span class="spatial object">truck</span>. </sentence><sentence id="246">And the next morning we found out that a lot of wealthy families, including a fair number of Jews had been deported. </sentence><sentence id="247">And so we thought, well, by class and so on, by our status, we were very likely to be included, and before long there was a phone call saying don't leave the <span class="building">house</span>, pack your bags and wait, we" ll come for you. </sentence><sentence id="248">So we -- we packed, we did as we were told, and of course we weren't at all happy about the prospect, and then we realized that our roomer had not come <span class="building">home</span> that night, he was out rounding up people, he was one of the leaders in this aktion. </sentence><sentence id="249">So when he finally came <span class="building">home</span>, my mother went to see him and asked if he could take us off the list. </sentence><sentence id="250">And he sort of joked and teased first, well don't you want to go to a sa -- to a great s -- <span class="region">Socialist Motherland</span>, or whatever he called it, and my mother answered diplomatically, well it's interesting [indecipherable] we're quite happy here, we'd rather stay here. </sentence><sentence id="251">And so he did manage to take us off the list and so for the moment we were saved. </sentence><sentence id="252">But this, of course, this event, this mass deportation is what -- as the Germans subsequently exploited a lot to arouse population against the Jews, but I presume we" ll come to that a little later. </sentence></p></dialogue>

mind you, until that time there had been no sort of program o-of mass killing of Jews, and therefore there didn't seem to be any -- any problem with half Jews. </sentence><sentence id="485">We certainly knew that they would not be treated as badly. </sentence><sentence id="486">And this was about as far as -- as my father dared to go. </sentence><sentence id="487">My best friend at that time in <span class="building">school</span>, who was Edward -- no, George Specter, who was a -- his parents were German Jewish refugees, had come to <span class="country">Latvia</span>, and they also had two sons George and Edward, only the age relationship was reversed. </sentence><sentence id="488">They played pretty much the same game, they claimed that their mother was Russian, not Jewish, and there was a grain of truth to it, I think she had a Russian grandmother, and -- but all the other grandpa -- grandparents were Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="489">So she claimed she was Russian, made her Gentile children were half Jews. </sentence><sentence id="490">And for awhile that was okay, but then they somehow felt sorry for the father, who was lef-left out in the cold, and they decided to try something new, and found an old woman who supposedly had worked as a cook in their <span class="building">household</span> and she then claimed in a affidavit that the f -- the father was really an illegitimate child of hers, and since she was Aryan, that'd make the father half Jew and then move everybody else up a notch. </sentence><sentence id="491">And that was too much for the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="492">They didn't believe it and they f-found a -- a pretext, I believe the -- the youngest son had made some change in the father's passport, and that was document forgery, they arrested him, they arrested the family and of course they were all killed immediately. </sentence><sentence id="493">So what -- first of all one had -- could only go so far, if you s -- the story became too implausible, then you lost the whole game. </sentence><sentence id="494">And the -- the other thing was -- was that we didn't realize yet that not all Gentiles were equal in -- in

troop and he produced some paper. </sentence><sentence id="842">Jews in those days who had special skills, and it's very important to the Germans, were spared, at least for the time being. </sentence><sentence id="843">That included craftsmen. </sentence><sentence id="844">One of the wonderful oddities of the German SD in our <span class="populated place">town</span> is -- was the German SD was in a <span class="building">building</span> separate from that of the Latvian SD, and the Latvians were not supposed to go anywhere except the <span class="interior space">ground floor</span> of the <span class="building">building</span>. </sentence><sentence id="845">In the <span class="interior space">basement</span> they had a number of Jewish craftsmen, watchmakers, jewelers, goldsmiths, this sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="846">Now it's remarkable why po -- a <span class="building">police unit</span> needs goldsmiths on -- on the side. </sentence><sentence id="847">It -- I -- I think nowhere in the <span class="country">U.S.</span> is a <span class="building">police unit</span> that has goldsmiths, and -- and watchmakers and so on. </sentence><sentence id="848">And neither do the Swiss police or any other I know of. </sentence><sentence id="849">On the other hand, th-the German security police was a rather special organization. </sentence><sentence id="850">So we were -- we were free, but then, couple days later we got a summons to go to the <span class="building">police</span> and we as -- were to turn in our passes. </sentence><sentence id="851">And they said, well, this is now out of the security police's hands, mixed bloods are now handled by the civilian administration, the so-called kibice commissar.

of the two of us he was a more obvious companion on such missions, went there, she told her story and he said well, we'll -- you'll have to do several things right away. </sentence><sentence id="856">First of all, you'll have to file for divorce from your husband. </sentence><sentence id="857">Then you'll have to get at least two affidavits from people that know you, that can prove that -- that your story is true. </sentence><sentence id="858">And then, he said, you" ll have to produce a baptismal certificate. </sentence><sentence id="859">Okay, filing su -- for divorce was no big deal, she did. </sentence><sentence id="860">Then months or so later, a -- a -- a letter arrived from the <span class="building">court</span>, saying that proceedings had been -- been dr-dropped, because the case was moot, since the state prosecutor had notified the <span class="building">court</span> that my father had died on the ninth of December 1941. </sentence><sentence id="861">Well, this came in handy after the war when my mother was trying to get some restitution payments -- pension from -- from German authorities and they wanted to have some proof that my father was killed, and under the circumstances this was the next best thing to an actual death certificate. </sentence><sentence id="862">S-So I-I will actually deposit a copy of this with the -- with the archives. </sentence><sentence id="863">Then the affidavits turned out not to be a problem, and I considered it somewhat indicative of the fact that there still were a fairly large number of decent people among Latvians. </sentence><sentence id="864">We had moved into our <span class="building">building</span> only two years earlier, and there was one -- the f -- of our neighbors there was one family who clearly were v- very troubled by the way we were treated, and they just -- at every opportunity they showed that their sympathies were the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="865">So my mother went to them and asked, could you help us? </sentence><sentence id="866">So quickly they figured out the best thing to do was the mother of -- of our neighbor would file an affidavit claiming that many years ago -- she was an old lady by then, that she had met, in going to the <span class="dlf">park</span> with her own daughter and she had met th -- a sort of maid that was taking care of my -- my mother. </sentence><sentence id="867">And they'd often taken out the children for walks together, and then the maid told her one day, this is not the real child of her parents, it's a foundling, a Christian

well known. </sentence><sentence id="871">So that was affidavit number one. </sentence><sentence id="872">The other one was by a younger woman who again test -- testified that she had met my -- my mother oh so, 10 to 15 years before the war, they'd become friends, and then one day my mother again confided in her that she wasn't the real child of her parents and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="873">And then she went on to say, well we, together -- she really had a Christian orientation, together we attended services in Saint Anne's <span class="building">church</span> and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="874">A -- a number of embellishments or outright inventions and so forth, then stressed that well, th-the children were brought up le -- no - - in -- in the [indecipherable] Christian spirit. </sentence><sentence id="875">That wasn't true at all, but th-they -- they went to a <span class="building">Latvian school</span>, not to a <span class="building">Jewish school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="876">At <span class="building">home</span> they used the German language and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="877">So again, she did her -- her best to make the story sound as plausible as possible. </sentence><sentence id="878">One thing I forgot to mention earlier, that the first -- when we got our first set of passes, and my mother had practically n-nothing to prove her case. </sentence><sentence id="879">But for years she had been corresponding with, of all things, the Rosicrucian fellowship in <span class="populated place">Oceanside</span>, <span class="region">California</span>. </sentence><sentence id="880">They had a correspondence service in any number of languages, she corresponded in German. </sentence><sentence id="881">I'm not quite sure why she corresponded with them, in part because she wanted some health advice, in part because there were some strains in her marriage and she wanted some counseling and so on, and they basically level-headed people, gave her some good advice. </sentence><sentence id="882">And there were occasional references to Jesus Christ, and you know, praying to him and -- and all would be well. </sentence><sentence id="883">And those she was able to filter out, and she was concentrating more on some vegetarian or whatever recipes, some herbal teas and so forth, and some of the good, common sense advice about how to deal with my father. </sentence><sentence id="884">But this was helpful, this was obviously a Christian organization and it's before the war, before there was any si -- ca -- question of trying to h-hide your Jewish origin, she was -- obviously had a Christian orientation. </sentence><sentence id="885">And the <span class="country">U.S.</span> at that time had not yet been

those letters came in handy. </sentence><sentence id="888">Now that the tough part were the baptismal certificates. </sentence><sentence id="889">We were told that the archives of the <span class="building">Baltic German churches</span> had all been removed to what -- to <span class="populated place">Posen</span>, which originally was a <span class="populated place">town</span> in <span class="country">Poland</span>, in <span class="region">western Poland</span>, and of course they'd been annexed by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="890">And they had settled a number of Baltic Germans there, and they clearly want to expand German -- <span class="building">ethnic German settlement</span> eastward as much as possible. </sentence><sentence id="891">This is -- was already part of -- of <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="892">So the <span class="building">church</span> records were supposed to be there, and she was supposed to write to them.

month back. </sentence><sentence id="895">It was in early 42.Then, the first -- it turned out the first address they'd given us wasn't the right one, so th -- took another set of letters and by the time the three months were up, all she had is this first letter saying sorry, you wrote to the wrong address. </sentence><sentence id="896">So she went to the kibice commissar, Mr.Butkarite and said, well, I've -- I've tried to do what you told me, but it's taking awhile, and here is the st-story. </sentence><sentence id="897">So he gave her a three month extension. </sentence><sentence id="898">He wasn't totally happy about it. </sentence><sentence id="899">Then after three months, well we had another exchange and the people at the <span class="building">archives</span> had misunderstood the question. </sentence><sentence id="900">They -- they said well, before we can do a search, you have to give the exact names of your parents and the date of your birth and the date of your baptism and all that. </sentence><sentence id="901">And my mother's date of birth was -- in -- in the records, was supposed to be the date when she was found, so she must have been born sometime previous to that. </sentence><sentence id="902">So, clearly they had misunderstood the question, this took another round of letters, and now Mr. Butkarite was getting impatient, he said, I'll give you one more three month extension, but that's going to be it. </sentence><sentence id="903">Three months were up and of course we didn't have anything yet. </sentence><sentence id="904">And as the 90

they said, oh no, he's no longer here. </sentence><sentence id="908">It's now Mr. Persil has taken his place. </sentence><sentence id="909">So my mother did some fast footwork and sort of backspaced a little bit and -- in the story and sort of took Mr. Persil to -- a few steps back from where we actually were, to gain time. </sentence><sentence id="910">Persil gave her the three months extension. </sentence><sentence id="911">And again, his patience gradually wore thin. </sentence><sentence id="912">And just when it seemed to be over, might have given us the final three months extension, once again he -- he was transferred, and in his place was a certain Mr. -- Mr. Gudschmidt. </sentence><sentence id="913">And well, meanwhile what been happening, it turned out that the <span

id="914">The <span class="building">Riga state archive</span> was closed indefinitely and so that gained us some more time, but in then end it was opened. </sentence><sentence id="915">My mother and I went to <span class="populated place">Riga</span> and looked the records, and lo and behold we found two girls were baptized Erika in the three months preceding the supposed date that my mother was found. </sentence><sentence id="916">Now the next step would have been to prove that my mother was one of these, which how do you -- do you prove that? </sentence><sentence id="917">I suppose you -- you prove that there was -- this person vanished without a trace. </sentence><sentence id="918">And Mr. Gudschmidt was no fool, he realized that as long as my mother was doing the -- this research herself, she could suppress any unfavorable evidence, and this could go on forever. </sentence><sentence id="919">And so he flatly refused to extend the <span class="dlf">passes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="920">Well, we -- now we went <span class="building">home</span> and we thought well, will the police come today or tomorrow? </sentence><sentence id="921">Will they come and

prepared for the worst. </sentence><sentence id="923">Instead, nothing whatsoever happened. </sentence><sentence id="924">Well, one of the weird things is during deg41 and deg42, there were a number of anti-Semites who repeatedly reported us to the police, and said here are some Jews who are not wearing the yellow patch. </sentence><sentence id="925">And eventually they got discouraged, and one rumor that was -- was circulated in <span class="populated place">town</span> was that we had connections to high places, specifically to Goering's staff. </sentence><sentence id="926">Well, Ih --

</sentence><sentence id="929">My mother had an office job in a tiny, little <span class="building">four person office</span>. </sentence><sentence id="930">It had a very, sort-of pretentious name.

Herman Goering. </sentence><sentence id="937">Well, these are big words that the average Latvian probably had trouble figuring them out. </sentence><sentence id="938">The only thing that probably made

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1235">A: Yes, well this sudden lifting of our <span class="dlf">passes</span> occurred in -- of -- the early fall of 1943, and from then on we were without any protection whatsoever. </sentence><sentence id="1236">We were fair game, but nobody came to shoot us. </sentence><sentence id="1237">The ill-wishers who would have liked to see us six feet under had sort of given up because they thought that for some mysterious reason we are immune from any kind of per-per- persecution. </sentence><sentence id="1238">The police chief, the Latvian police chief himself, who was in a good position to know that my mother was the biological child of her parents, because he had lived next <span class="dlf">door</span> to them, again decided not to lift a finger against us. </sentence><sentence id="1239">He said that he would not give me a -- a passport, which he would -- I -- I was required to have from age 16, but at the same time h-he wasn't going to do anything against me, which was -- left me in some kind of a limbo, but it turned out to be not such a bad place to be. </sentence><sentence id="1240">A substitute that became increasingly important was, since I was not allowed to continue <span class="building">school</span>, I enrolled in some correspondence course -- well, actually this was more of a home study course, with some so-called <span class="building">Rustian Institute</span> in <span class="populated place">Potsdam</span>, <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1241">And they send you little booklets for various subjects, for -- depending on what program you took. </sentence><sentence id="1242">There were different, many different programs. </sentence><sentence id="1243">And the first thing they s -- they sent me was a very impressive looking I.D. card with my picture and a -- a big Prussian eagle. </sentence><sentence id="1244">It wasn't the -- Hit-Hitler's eagle with a swas -- swastika, but it was still a very impressive bird. </sentence><sentence id="1245">And so that was a very handy, official looking identification card, which I could use on -- on occasion. </sentence><sentence id="1246">Th-Then w-we were so -- I should now take the story back to -- so -- a couple of weeks after we had been released from <span class="building">prisons</span>, was -- was shortly before New Year's, 1942. </sentence><sentence id="1247">The -- the -- </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1248"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1249">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1250"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1251"> 5 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1252">Q: 42?

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3589">A: I think it has taught me not to generalize about people, and th-there are really two factors that pushed me in that direction. </sentence><sentence id="3590">One of them was that before the German occupation, we thought that just because my -- my father was a very decent businessman, he had some letters from his German customers commending him for having warned them about some unfair practices of some -- some other business people, that no matter what -- whether there were any legitimate complaints that the anti-Semites had about certain Jews, that my father had a-a-an excellent record and that he would be treated accordingly, that they would not -- not treat everybody the same regardless of what you -- you've done as a person. </sentence><sentence id="3591">And similarly Germans, I've learned very quickly that there were some -- some awful Germans, some monsters, and there were some angels, and lots of in between, and -- and the same with Latvians. </sentence><sentence id="3592">And so I began to realize that it's absolutely wrong to generalize. </sentence><sentence id="3593">I -- I don't like to say the Germans, or the -- the Jews, or the Lat-Latvians. </sentence><sentence id="3594">I tend to view people as individuals. </sentence><sentence id="3595">So that's one important lesson that I learned. </sentence><sentence id="3596">And the other thing is that I feel that sort of ethnic religious labels are some of the less important descriptives of a person. </sentence><sentence id="3597">The story that I like that illustrates this very well, a number of years ago, there was a conductor named Dean Dixon, an American. </sentence><sentence id="3598">When he first gave a concert in <span class="country">Europe</span> -- he spent much of his career in <span class="country">Europe</span>, the newspapers would write about the American Negro conductor, Dean Dixon. </sentence><sentence id="3599">After the second concert it was the American conductor Dean Dixon. </sentence><sentence id="3600">After the third one it was the conductor Dean Dixon. </sentence><sentence id="3601">They should have This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="3602">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="3603"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 5 started with the third concert right away, because to s-size up Dean Dixon the most important thing is a conductor. </sentence><sentence id="3604">He was a good conductor, he was a mediocre conductor but he obviously knows a lot about music and so on. </sentence><sentence id="3605">Prefers certain kinds of music and so on. </sentence><sentence id="3606">It's less important that he is Am-American, music is fairly universal. </sentence><sentence id="3607">Still less important that he is black. </sentence><sentence id="3608">In the end all of these factors have to be considered, but they went at them in the reverse order. </sentence><sentence id="3609">And I want to be known primarily as -- as Edward Anders, who has done such and such with his life, done some good things and some bad things, made some mistakes, had certain quirks and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="3610">I have [indecipherable] done research in certain <span class="region">area</span>, I've done this or that, and it's considerably less important that -- that I am an American, or that I'm a Jew by birth. </sentence><sentence id="3611">So, to me these are less im-important because there's such a tremendous variety of Americans, there's such a tremendous variety of Jews, and to start with either my American citizenship or my Jewish background and put that as the number one label on me, I -- I think it's putting the <span class="spatial object">cart</span> before the horse. </sentence></p></dialogue>
