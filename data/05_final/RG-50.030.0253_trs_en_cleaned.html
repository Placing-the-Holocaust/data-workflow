<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7">A: All right. </sentence><sentence id="8">I'm Curtis R. Whiteway. </sentence><sentence id="9">And I was born in <span class="populated place">Newburyport</span>, Mass[achusetts], in 1925. </sentence><sentence id="10">November 3rd. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="15">Q: Tell me a little bit about yourself, and your advent into the <span class="building">Army</span>. </sentence><sentence id="16">And, uh, then we can talk about your career in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="19">A: All right. </sentence><sentence id="20">In 19...the December 1943, I was drafted, uh, into the, uh, Army. </sentence><sentence id="21">And then, uh, uh, we're at <span class="populated place">Fort Devens</span>, Mass[achusetts]." </sentence><sentence id="22">And then, uh, couple of days later, taken to <span class="populated place">Fort Knox</span>, <span class="region">Kentucky</span>, for, uh, my major training in the armored forces. </sentence><sentence id="23">I continued on then, uh, after graduating there. </sentence><sentence id="24">Instead of going into the armored, uh, division, they took a group of us, uh, that were apparently high in the records of, uh, achievement; and they sent us to <span class="region">South Carolina</span>, to the Rangers, where we received 19 weeks of very intensive training. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="31">Q: Then you went overseas? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="33">A: Then we went, uh, to, uh, <span class="populated place">Camp Maxey</span>, <span class="region">Texas</span>, and joined the 99th Division. </sentence><sentence id="34">Uh, there we were supposed to train a lot of the troops, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="35">And we went immediately over to <span class="country">England</span> (clearing throat) by way of <span class="populated place">Boston</span>. </sentence><sentence id="36">So from <span class="country">England</span>, well, we trained for awhile. </sentence><sentence id="37">Invasion training. </sentence><sentence id="38">And then, uh, very shortly, why, we land...we went across the <span class="dlf">channel</span> in <span class="spatial object">LSTs</span> and landed at <span class="populated place">Le Havre</span>." </sentence><sentence id="39">And we had a little bit of skirmishes there; but, uh, we moved <span class="region">inland</span>, uh, into <span class="country">Belgium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="40">And then we relieved the <span class="building">9th Infantry Division</span> on <span class="dlf">line</span>, in uh...in around the area of <span class="populated place">Liege</span> [Flem: Luik], <span class="country">Belgium</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="49">Q: And then, what happened after that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="51">A: All right. </sentence><sentence id="52">Uh...uh, of course, we were totally green. </sentence><sentence id="53">We had a lot of experience, uh, there in, uh, training, but, uh, totally green to combat. </sentence><sentence id="54">And, uh, about a month and a half later, uh, on December 16th at dawn, the Germans attacked us with, uh, uh, over 10 to | of their prime German SS troopers, Panzer Grenadiers, the, uh, German, uh, paratroopers, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="55">And Just simply overwhelmed us on what we now call "<span class="dlf">Hell's Corner</span>." </sentence><sentence id="56">And, uh, like, uh, my company, uh, of--as I understand now--of approximately 216 men, there were only 29 of us survived. </sentence><sentence id="57">And then, uh, we, uh, managed to hold the <span class="dlf">line</span>. </sentence><sentence id="58">We wiped out the 3rd Panzer Division"--uh, with...with great help of our artillery, of course. </sentence><sentence id="59">And, uh, then, uh, within  USHMM Archives RG-50.030*253 2 about another month or so, why, we began getting replacements and were again ready for combat and pushing into <span class="country">Germany</span> through the <span class="dlf">Siegfried Line</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="69">Q: Tell us what happened after that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="71">A: All right. </sentence><sentence id="72">We pushed, uh, into <span class="country">Germany</span>, uh, forcing, naturally, the German army back, or...or just wiping them out. </sentence><sentence id="73">Uh, I'm making it sound a lot easier than, uh, what actually happened. </sentence><sentence id="74">But, uh, we...the main part is we came to, uh, <span class="populated place">Cologne</span> [Ger: K6ln]; and, uh, then switched, uh, south to, uh, the...one of our armored divisions had captured a <span class="dlf">bridge</span> now know as the <span class="dlf">Remagen Bridge</span>. </sentence><sentence id="75">We were immediately pulled out of the fighting in <span class="populated place">Cologne</span>, and pulled <span class="region">south</span>. </sentence><sentence id="76">And my battalion was the first, uh, of the 99th Division to arrive there. </sentence><sentence id="77">And we went over the <span class="dlf">bridge</span> that night, under very heavy fire, took the [Epellolai (ph)] on the other side--uh, which is a <span class="env feature">mountain</span> there--and held it and until other troops could get up there. </sentence><sentence id="78">And we pushed <span class="region">inland</span>, and made what is known as a <span class="dlf">bridgehead</span>. </sentence><sentence id="79">It was in this <span class="dlf">bridgehead</span> that we first came upon our first <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="89">Q: Tell us about that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="91">A: All right. </sentence><sentence id="92">The army (clearing throat) had never, uh, informed of ...us of anything about the <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="93">Uh, so that we were not mentally prepared for anything. </sentence><sentence id="94">Uh, the first few <span class="populated place">camps</span>, uh, that we came to, we were ordered--being combat troops, our mission was to fight and destroy the German army. </sentence><sentence id="95">So we would part, and go around these huge <span class="populated place">camps</span>, and re-engage on the other side. </sentence><sentence id="96">In doing this, we came by...many times, the...one of the <span class="dlf">gates</span>. </sentence><sentence id="97">And here, uh, uh--as I've learned or put together in the last few years--a handful of men would normally be detailed to go into the <span class="populated place">camps</span>, unchain the people who were chained and so on, and release the prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="98">Uh, the rest of all the combat troops would, as I say, continue engaging the German troops. </sentence><sentence id="99">As we went by the <span class="dlf">gates</span>, we would see, uh, handfuls, or, uh, quite a few prisoners--or, uh we now call them, survivors--would come outside the <span class="dlf">gates</span> [and] be standing there as we were passing by, either on foot or on <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> and <span class="spatial object">tanks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="100">And they would be waving to you, and they'd be all smiles. </sentence><sentence id="101">And if they got a chance, they'd come over to you and hug and kiss you and shake hands. </sentence><sentence id="102">And this threw us off guard. </sentence><sentence id="103">Because now, when we saw all these smiling faces, we assumed that they were alright. </sentence><sentence id="104">And we just kept on going. </sentence><sentence id="105">The only ones to see any of the horrors in the <span class="populated place">camps</span>, not... For us, not realizing that many of them were not physically able to come out of the <span class="dlf">gates</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="121">Q: The Germans had already left the <span class="populated place">camps</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="123">A: The Germans normally, uh, in my experience, uh, would normally stay in the <span class="populated place">camps</span>--the  USHMM Archives RG-50.030*253 3 guards--until we were approaching one of the <span class="dlf">gates</span>. </sentence><sentence id="124">And they would withdraw out the back, uh, side, uh, opposite side, of wherever we were approaching. </sentence><sentence id="125">And what L...we've learned is that they would normally take selected prisoners--usually Jewish people--uh, out the <span class="dlf">back gates</span>, and keep on taking them in forced marches, uh, further into <span class="country">Germany</span> or into <span class="country">Austria</span>. </sentence><sentence id="126">And they would continue then to try to kill them as fast as they could do that. </sentence><sentence id="127">Uh, we hadn't learned that at this point, uh, there. </sentence><sentence id="128">And so it was a very tragic thing, uh, to be able to permit the Germans to...to keep on murdering people like that. ( </sentence><sentence id="129">Clearing throat) They usually beat them to death with rifle butts or...or bayonets, or just shoot them. </sentence><sentence id="130">But they...we also learned that they had to be very careful about not using too much ammunition, because they were going to need that to fight us. </sentence><sentence id="131">So we continued on fighting, continued past the <span class="populated place">camps</span>--except for our handfuls of men that would go in. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="141">Q: There many <span class="populated place">camps</span> like that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="143">A: There were many <span class="populated place">camps</span> like this. </sentence><sentence id="144">And we continued pushing north into <span class="country">Germany</span>, until we came to a <span class="populated place">city</span> called <span class="populated place">Giessen</span> [<span class="populated place">Giessen</span> is due east of <span class="populated place">Remagen</span>]. </sentence><sentence id="145">And in <span class="populated place">Giessen</span>--or in that <span class="region">area</span>--uh, my group was selected to, uh...at nighttime, swim the <span class="env feature">river</span> [this would have been the <span class="env feature">Lahne River</span>], come in quietly behind the German guards and the engineers at the <span class="dlf">bridges</span>, and quietly take them off. </sentence><sentence id="146">And then cut the, uh, cords to all the explosives on the <span class="dlf">bridges</span>. </sentence><sentence id="147">At dawn, or about dawn, then our entire regiment or battalion came in on <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> and <span class="spatial object">tanks</span> quickly; and were inside the <span class="populated place">city</span> before the Germans knew it." </sentence><sentence id="148">Now, I was ordered to take my men and go down one of the main <span class="dlf">streets</span>. </sentence><sentence id="149">We fought from <span class="building">building</span> to <span class="building">building</span>, <span class="building">house</span> to <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="150">But in this <span class="region">area</span> was very different from many of the other <span class="region">areas</span> in, uh...in Europe--and in particular, in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="151">Because we came upon the most appalling odor that I have ever smelled. </sentence><sentence id="152">And there's no way to really describe it. </sentence><sentence id="153">Uh, except to bring out the, uh, important points that, by now, in <span class="region">northern Germany</span> like this we're all very experienced combat troops. </sentence><sentence id="154">We had seen all kinds of human misery. </sentence><sentence id="155">We were used to the odor of death, of, uh, flesh--burning flesh--and all this kind of thing. </sentence><sentence id="156">But this odor was, uh, very distinct, and very strong. </sentence><sentence id="157">We had to find heavy cloth in the <span class="building">buildings</span> that we were fighting in, from the German soldiers; and hold it over our faces while we're trying to shoot. </sentence><sentence id="158">Because this... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="175">Q: How large was this <span class="populated place">city</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="177">A: Uh, the <span class="populated place">city</span> was quite large. </sentence><sentence id="178">Uh, I would compare it, uh, with the size of <span class="populated place">Malden</span>, Mass[achusetts]. </sentence><sentence id="179">Of, uh, say around a 100,000.deg Somewhere on that idea. </sentence><sentence id="180">And, uh, as we pushed down on this particular <span class="region">area</span>, why, the odor got worse. </sentence><sentence id="181">And we finally came to a big <span class="dlf">stone wall</span>, and a huge ancient <span class="dlf">wooden gate</span>. </sentence><sentence id="182">Upon top were <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span>, <span class="spatial object">machine gun nests</span>. </sentence><sentence id="183">There was no soldiers there, at this point. </sentence><sentence id="184">Uh, apparently, each time we finally approached  USHMM Archives RG-50.030*253 4 the <span class="populated place">camps</span> that the guards in the <span class="populated place">camps</span> would not engage us. </sentence><sentence id="185">They would run instead. </sentence><sentence id="186">Unlike the Wehrmacht or the regular infantry. </sentence><sentence id="187">So, when we came to the <span class="dlf">gate</span>, we knew we had some kind of a <span class="building">prison</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="188">And we put TNT against the <span class="dlf">gate</span>, and we blew it in. </sentence><sentence id="189">Ran inside, dispersed to cover each other, and engage what we knew would be the, uh, the Death["s]- Head--from experience, the Death's] -Head SS troopers" uh, that normally ran these <span class="populated place">camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="190">And this <span class="populated place">camp</span> was called <span class="populated place">Hadamar</span>." </sentence><sentence id="191">Uh, it turned out to be, uh, an <span class="populated place">extermination camp</span>, not a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>." </sentence><sentence id="192">Uh, why I say that is because they weren't keeping the prisoners there for long periods of time and starving them and tormenting them and torturing them and terrorizing them, like in other <span class="populated place">camps</span> that we would go into. </sentence><sentence id="193">As we burst into the <span class="populated place">camp</span> and spread out, I saw in front of me a row of <span class="building">barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="194">Wooden, one-story <span class="building">barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="195">In front of the <span class="building">barracks</span>, at that point, was a large group of...what we called in those days "slaves," for lack of any other word. </sentence><sentence id="196">Now we call them survivors. </sentence><sentence id="197">And they were standing there totally shocked at, of course, the explosion of the <span class="dlf">gate</span> being blown in, these strange men in strange uniforms running in. </sentence><sentence id="198">And they didn't know who we were. </sentence><sentence id="199">Uh, I since learned, of course, that the Germans kept all the information, news, away from them. </sentence><sentence id="200">So that...thus not ever giving them any hope of surviving. </sentence><sentence id="201">I knew that these people were of no danger to us; so I immediately, being combat, turned my attention to the left, to the <span class="building">buildings</span>. </sentence><sentence id="202">And I ordered my men to start going through the <span class="building">buildings</span> and start cleaning them out--in other words, engaging the German soldier, the SS troopers. </sentence><sentence id="203">Uh, at that point, one of my men came for me. </sentence><sentence id="204">And he asked me...he says, "You'd better come with me." </sentence><sentence id="205">And he had a voice...his tone of voice was very serious. </sentence><sentence id="206">I followed him across the <span class="dlf">yard</span> to a <span class="building">building</span>; and as I, uh, observed, the <span class="building">building</span>--to my best memory now--was a <span class="building">masonry building</span>. </sentence><sentence id="207">The <span class="dlf">windows</span> were all sealed up. </sentence><sentence id="208">Outside, as I can remember now, was, I believe, eight <span class="spatial object">automobiles</span>, all up on <span class="dlf">blocks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="209">In other words, they were in permanent position. </sentence><sentence id="210">The <span class="spatial object">wheels</span> had been taken off. </sentence><sentence id="211">The exhaust were piped in through the <span class="dlf">wall</span> of that <span class="building">building</span>. </sentence><sentence id="212">And I... We couldn't really understand what this was. </sentence><sentence id="213">We went inside the <span class="dlf">door</span>; and there's a couple of my other men there, standing there waiting for me. </sentence><sentence id="214">In the <span class="interior space">room</span>....there was nobody in there, other than my own men. </sentence><sentence id="215">But there was human excretion, vomit, urine, blood all over the <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="216">At this point we're looking around, somebody had asked me what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="217">And I really had no idea. </sentence><sentence id="218">I did not understand. </sentence><sentence id="219">None of us did. </sentence><sentence id="220">One of the men went over to the far <span class="dlf">wall</span>, uh, as I remember to my left. </sentence><sentence id="221">And there were <span class="spatial object">shower heads</span> and <span class="spatial object">faucets</span> all over the <span class="dlf">wall</span>. </sentence><sentence id="222">He turned them on. </sentence><sentence id="223">He called out to me; and he says, "What the Hell's going on here?" </sentence><sentence id="224">And I looked over questionly. </sentence><sentence id="225">And he said, "There's no <span class="env feature">water</span>." </sentence><sentence id="226">And I just shook my head. </sentence><sentence id="227">I didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="228"> USHMM Archives RG-50.030*253 5 And just about this point.... And, of course, you can imagine what the odor was like in this <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="229">It was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="230">Uh, at that point, another man in a <span class="dlf">doorway</span> motioned for us to come out into the <span class="interior space">back room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="231">As we entered the <span class="interior space">back room</span>, the <span class="interior space">room</span> was filled with <span class="spatial object">benches</span> and...and, uh, uh, <span class="spatial object">tables</span>. </sentence><sentence id="232">And on the <span class="spatial object">tables</span>, there was thousands of gold wedding rings. </sentence><sentence id="233">And there were diamond rings--uh, engagement rings, or whatever you want to call them in <span class="country">Europe</span>. </sentence><sentence id="234">Uh, there was piles of human teeth with gold filling. </sentence><sentence id="235">These were all being separated. </sentence><sentence id="236">And then it was obvious that somebody was in there counting them, and separating them. </sentence><sentence id="237">We still just began to understand; but really didn't under....understand what was happening in this <span class="populated place">camp</span>, at that point. </sentence><sentence id="238">Uh, we went outside into the, uh, <span class="dlf">yard</span> again. </sentence><sentence id="239">Only this is on the back side of the <span class="building">building</span>, more or less. </sentence><sentence id="240">And here in front of me, I could see huge piles of human hair. </sentence><sentence id="241">I could see...as the Germans did everything very neatly, there were piles of boots, shoes, <span class="spatial object">suitcases</span>, eyeglasses. </sentence><sentence id="242">And I stood there looking at the <span class="spatial object">eyeglasses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="243">And I couldn't imagine how many thousands of people those eyeglasses represented, just sitting there in a huge <span class="spatial object">pile</span>. </sentence><sentence id="244">To my left was <span class="spatial object">hay wagons</span>--four-wheel <span class="spatial object">hay wagons</span> and <span class="spatial object">two-wheel push carts</span>, which were common in <span class="country">Europe</span>. </sentence><sentence id="245">Only, these <span class="spatial object">wagons</span> all contained nude bodies. </sentence><sentence id="246">They were separated; but there was men, women, children, and even babies. </sentence><sentence id="247">All nude, all dead, all piled as high as they basically could pile them on these <span class="spatial object">wagons</span>. </sentence><sentence id="248">And I remember going over and looking at...fairly close. </sentence><sentence id="249">Especially at some of the children--which...which was appalling to us. </sentence><sentence id="250">They apparently had been just taken out of the <span class="building">building</span> we just left, and been gassed. </sentence><sentence id="251">Uh, we...at that point, one...another man came to me. </sentence><sentence id="252">And here again he said, "You'd better come with us." </sentence><sentence id="253">And we followed them into another <span class="building">building</span> behind. </sentence><sentence id="254">In the <span class="interior space">room</span>, as we entered, here was bodies thrown at random on the <span class="interior space">floor</span>. </sentence><sentence id="255">On the far <span class="dlf">wall</span>.... And, of course, you can imagine the odor was absolutely terrible in this place. </sentence><sentence id="256">Uh, on the, uh, far <span class="dlf">wall</span> was a battery of <span class="spatial object">ovens</span>. </sentence><sentence id="257">Big <span class="spatial object">ovens</span>. </sentence><sentence id="258">Uh, I never did count the <span class="spatial object">ovens</span>, but they were on fire. </sentence><sentence id="259">Some of the <span class="dlf">doors</span> were open. </sentence><sentence id="260">There were bodies in the <span class="spatial object">ovens</span>, still burning. </sentence><sentence id="261">Uh, we were so shocked. </sentence><sentence id="262">And now we were beginning to understand that there was...this was some kind of an <span class="building">execution camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="263">Or as we now call, <span class="populated place">extermination camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="264">Uh, we left the...that <span class="interior space">room</span>, and went out into the, uh, <span class="dlf">yard</span> again. </sentence><sentence id="265">And still my men were scattering all over the place, uh...of course, looking for the German soldier; but now finding more and more, uh, things in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="266">I turned my attention back to the original group of the "slaves," as we called them then. </sentence><sentence id="267">And as I walked across the <span class="dlf">yard</span>, I called out to them. </sentence><sentence id="268">And I noticed...for...for one thing, of course, the condition of these people. </sentence><sentence id="269">As I can remember, they were all men. </sentence><sentence id="270">And now I assume that they were like a burial detail to handle all the bodies. </sentence><sentence id="271">Uh, but they were in a horrible condition, uh, of starvation, of disease. </sentence><sentence id="272">The bodies...there was no flesh in their bodies. </sentence><sentence id="273">They were just skin...actual skin and bones. </sentence><sentence id="274">Their body odor was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="275">Uh, there...and no hair, or literally no hair, on their bodies. </sentence><sentence id="276">Their eyes sunken way back in their heads. </sentence><sentence id="277">And as I approached them, I also saw the yellow star of David, uh, on their clothing. </sentence><sentence id="278">And coming from <span class="populated place">Boston</span> and all the ethnic, uh, <span class="region">areas</span>, that I understood that they were Jews. </sentence><sentence id="279">I called out to them as I approached them. </sentence><sentence id="280">I says, "Does anybody speak English?" </sentence><sentence id="281">And finally, one man spoke up, uh, very much like a zombie; but he answered me, "Yes," in English. </sentence><sentence id="282">So I addressed him, uh, personally. </sentence><sentence id="283">And I came over to him; and I looked at him, and I said, "We are American soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="284">It's all over. </sentence><sentence id="285">Do you understand what I'm saying to you?" </sentence><sentence id="286">And he stood there frozen in place. </sentence><sentence id="287">He wasn't looking at me. </sentence><sentence id="288">He was looking over my shoulder; and he was apparently looking at my men, who were still...some of them running  USHMM Archives RG-50.030*253 6 through the <span class="building">buildings</span>, uh, there. </sentence><sentence id="289">And then first thing...-he wouldn't change his expression on his face, but tears started coming down his face. </sentence><sentence id="290">And then he started to cry. </sentence><sentence id="291">And he started to sob. </sentence><sentence id="292">And then he started to sob his heart out; and he fell to the <span class="env feature">ground</span> on his knees. </sentence><sentence id="293">And he just cried his heart out. </sentence><sentence id="294">And I stood there, standing there watching him, and waiting. </sentence><sentence id="295">And after awhile, he regained his composure. </sentence><sentence id="296">And then he stopped crying. </sentence><sentence id="297">And then he spoke in Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="298">Which I had heard many times in the <span class="region">Boston area</span>, and I recognized what it was. </sentence><sentence id="299">And then he told them that we were American soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="300">Now, at this point, there were other Americans coming." </sentence><sentence id="301">And I could see over in the background, in other <span class="dlf">gates</span> or other <span class="region">areas</span> of the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, other Americans would come in. </sentence><sentence id="302">They began going through the <span class="building">hospital</span>--because this was a <span class="populated place">camp</span> under the K-4 program, || uh, where they were exterminating or cleansing their own <span class="country">nation</span>, originally, and then went through many other peoples, uh, before they....And then they finally were exterminating the Jewish people, at this period of time that we were there. </sentence><sentence id="303">And we then were ordered out of the <span class="populated place">camp</span> to help re-engage the German soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="304">And we left the other Americans in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="305">They saw many other things that I or my group did not see. </sentence><sentence id="306">And then we...we continued fighting for that <span class="region">region</span>. </sentence><sentence id="307">Uh, we pushed....The best.... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="441">Q: They were killing right up to the moment...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="443">A: To the moment that we arrived there. </sentence><sentence id="444">Uh, which was something very, very hard to understand. </sentence><sentence id="445">Uh, but, as I mentioned, that, uh, in the <span class="populated place">camps</span> we learned that they were taking prisoners out the <span class="dlf">back gates</span> to continue that time of killing what they called "prime prisoners." </sentence><sentence id="446">And it took us a while longer before we would learn that fact, and then begin to outmaneuver them. ( </sentence><sentence id="447">Clearing throat) And we continued pushing through <span class="region">northern Germany</span>, to <span class="populated place">Kassel</span> [approximately 60 miles northwest of <span class="populated place">Giessen</span>]. </sentence><sentence id="448">And, uh...I believe that was about the deepest penetration; uh, when we were ordered to hold up. </sentence><sentence id="449">And then, uh, this was getting into an <span class="region">area</span> that was declared by [the] Yalta Agreement" that would be <span class="region">Russian territory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="450">So that now, other troops would come in and take our place and hold this <span class="dlf">line</span>. </sentence><sentence id="451">We were pulled out; and we would turn and head south--toward <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span> [Ger: <span class="populated place">Niirnberg</span>], Frankfurt[-am- Main], <span class="populated

</sentence><sentence id="454">At that time of...of uh, the war, uh, there were <span class="populated place">slave labor camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="455">Many of them. </sentence><sentence

id="457">Uh, sometimes, I would only just penetrate. </sentence><sentence id="458">Uh, we came to a <span class="populated place">camp</span> called <span class="populated place">Ohrdruf</span>, ~ as best as I can determine to this day. </sentence><sentence id="459">And now I'm starting to  <span class="building">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.030*253 7 remember more...just recently starting to remember more and more about this; putting together other facts from my own <span class="region">division</span>, where we were at that time. </sentence><sentence id="460">But, as I can determine now, it was <span class="populated place">Ohrdruf</span>."* </sentence><sentence id="461">And it was a small <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="462">We came right to the middle, apparently, of the <span class="populated place">camp</span> itself--of the <span class="region">outside</span>. </sentence><sentence id="463">There was nothing there in front of us but <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span>. </sentence><sentence id="464">Behind the <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span>, we could see into the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="465">And there were <span class="spatial object">bodies</span> laying all over the place. </sentence><sentence id="466">There were some small <span class="building">buildings</span> and so on. </sentence><sentence id="467">The odor, again, was terrible here. </sentence><sentence id="468">Uh, I radioed in to the captain, uh, that we had come to the <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span> and some kind of a <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="469">He ordered all of us to turn left, and go around the <span class="populated place">camp</span> in that direction. </sentence><sentence id="470">Apparently, one of the other <span class="building">companies</span> was on our other flank would go the other direction. </sentence><sentence id="471">As we walked along the <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span> and we kept looking in. </sentence><sentence id="472">Of course, we were in a very depressed mood, uh, looking at...at all these <span

</sentence><sentence id="474">And we passed a <span class="dlf">gate</span>. </sentence><sentence id="475">Whether it was the main <span class="dlf">gate</span>, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="476">But we passed a <span class="dlf">gate</span>. </sentence><sentence id="477">And at that point, now other...all the rest of the company was, uh, was progressing the same way. </sentence><sentence id="478">Some [of] them--uh, American soldiers of our own, uh, outfit, and probably of our own company--were already inside the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="479">Only a few. </sentence><sentence id="480">And, I believe, two men came over toward us and started waving us anxiously to come in to help them. </sentence><sentence id="481">So I radioed to Captain Pat,"deg or the company command, and told them that we, uh, uh, were requested [to] uh, help, uh, there. </sentence><sentence id="482">He gave us permission to move into the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="483">So as far as I know that only my squad turned and went into the uh...to the <span class="populated place">camp</span> itself. </sentence><sentence id="484">As we were walking in, as I say, there was bodies laying literally all over the place. </sentence><sentence id="485">And as I can remember, here again on my left as I was coming in, there was some <span class="building">buildings</span>. </sentence><sentence id="486">And there was a <span class="building">gallows</span>. </sentence><sentence id="487">And I can't distinguish in my mind at this point whether there was just one or more. </sentence><sentence id="488">And I believe there was more <span class="building">gallows</span>. </sentence><sentence id="489">But there was no rope. </sentence><sentence id="490">It was...it was wire that they were using for a <span class="spatial object">noose</span>. </sentence><sentence id="491">Uh, during the short stay in there, one of the survivors--and there weren't very many as far as I know--had explained to me what the Germans were doing. </sentence><sentence id="492">There were pile...piles of bodies all around the <span class="building">gallows</span>. </sentence><sentence id="493">And they were taking the prisoners, and making...forcing them to stand under the <span class="spatial object">gallows</span>. </sentence><sentence id="494">They would tighten the <span class="dlf">noose</span> around and then they would adjust it up on top. </sentence><sentence id="495">So they would pull them up and stretch them, so only their toes would Just barely touch the <span class="env feature">ground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="496">And they left them that way. </sentence><sentence id="497">And as I can understand, as I remember the prisoner telling me--or the survivor--that it took something like about 15 minutes for them to die that way. </sentence><sentence id="498">And, of course, this was very disgusting to us, at that point. </sentence><sentence id="499">We were also looking... trying to look at other things that we were seeing in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="500">The...we were starting to wander among the bodies, to see if we could help some of them. </sentence><sentence id="501">And each one that I came to, I knew just by looking at them that they were beyond help. </sentence><sentence id="502">Uh, even...even...we didn't have any medics in our <span class="building">company</span>. </sentence><sentence id="503">They had all been shot in the head by the snipers. </sentence><sentence id="504">And what little medicine we had.... Well, [there] was no medicine. </sentence><sentence id="505">All we had was bandages, by that time there. </sentence><sentence id="506">Uh, I came to...now as I remember, uh, a nude woman. </sentence><sentence id="507"> USHMM Archives RG-50.030*253 8 And it was apparent she was pregnant. </sentence><sentence id="508">And I was standing there looking... And this is something terrible to me, in my mind. </sentence><sentence id="509">She had a rope tied around her legs. </sentence><sentence id="510">But it wasn't in a position where apparently the prisoners or somebody had tied ropes on her ankles and dragged the body out. </sentence><sentence id="511">And it confused me. </sentence><sentence id="512">Why would the rope be tied around her legs?And I was standing there pondering that, uh, fact, when one of the survivors in that <span class="populated place">camp</span> quietly came over beside me. </sentence><sentence id="513">And he began talking very softly. </sentence><sentence id="514">And he told me; he says she was pregnant. </sentence><sentence id="515">And as the baby was being born, the SS troopers took her clothing off--or ripped her clothing off, I think, is the way he put it--and then tied a rope tightly around her legs. </sentence><sentence id="516">And then left her and the baby to die that way; because, naturally, the baby couldn't be born. </sentence><sentence id="517">And, of course, that upset me very, very much. </sentence><sentence id="518">In fact, I've had some...some rather terrible nightmares over it. </sentence><sentence id="519">And I remember then getting orders to leave the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, while others.... There were now more apparently of the...the supporting troops were coming in. </sentence><sentence id="520">And they were coming in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, and they were spreading out with some medics. </sentence><sentence id="521">I can remember seeing some medics with their <span class="building">Red Cross</span> armbands on. </sentence><sentence id="522">And we left; and we rejoined our company. </sentence><sentence id="523">And we began, again, in the combat. </sentence><sentence id="524">And we pushed <span class="region">south</span> again. </sentence><sentence id="525">There were other <span class="populated place">camps</span> that we came to. </sentence><sentence id="526">Other men went in and so-called "liberated" the <span class="populated place">camps</span> and the prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="527">Uh, released them, or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="528">I can remember seeing just tidbits of different <span class="populated place">camps</span> like that. </sentence><sentence id="529">And we kept on going. </sentence><sentence id="530">And now the German Army was disintegrating, so that they would disappear and pull back as much as 50 miles in... And, uh, then set up <span class="dlf">lines</span>. </sentence><sentence id="531">We would come out of the <span class="env feature">woods</span>. </sentence><sentence id="532">We'd come out of the <span class="building">buildings</span>, and come onto the, uh, <span class="dlf">roads</span>, and walk the <span class="dlf">roads</span> until the points we'd re-engage the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="533">And we'd spread out and re-engage them again. </sentence><sentence id="534">Uh, in doing this, we came, uh, into the <span class="region">area</span> of, as I now know as, <span class="populated place">Bavaria</span>. </sentence><sentence id="535">And we were going up a <span class="env feature">mountain</span>. </sentence><sentence id="536">And up at the top, all ofa sudden...my two scouts were always up in front of me. </sentence><sentence id="537">And I was always the third man. </sentence><sentence id="538">Uh, the rest of the men were behind me. </sentence><sentence id="539">Uh, the two scouts signaled, and they hit the <span class="env feature">ground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="540">I, uh, signaled for all the men to hit the <span class="env feature">ground</span>, and...uh, for cover. </sentence><sentence id="541">And then I crawled up to where the two scouts were. </sentence><sentence id="542">And they pointed up ahead; and I could see some men up through the <span class="env feature">woods</span>--quite a distance from us--that were running from <span class="env feature">tree</span> to <span class="env feature">tree</span>. </sentence><sentence id="543">They were very skittish. </sentence><sentence id="544">And observing them, uh, I assumed that they were of no danger, that they were not German soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="545">Because they had no helmets and they had no rifles. </sentence><sentence id="546">Uh, they... First, I thought they were women; because they had a long robe on them that went all the way to the ankles. </sentence><sentence id="547">Now, I've been able to understand that what they were was prisoners that were allowed out of that <span class="populated place">camp</span> that we were going to come to. </sentence><sentence id="548">Uh, and they were on perhaps burial detail. </sentence><sentence id="549">Uh, but the idea of the long gown or dress on them was that they were hobbled, so they could not run. </sentence><sentence id="550">The bottom [of] the uniform or dress was very close at the ankle. </sentence><sentence id="551">But what they were doing there was they were hiding behind the <span class="env feature">tree</span>. </sentence><sentence id="552">There was quite a few of them. </sentence><sentence id="553">And they'd look around, just like rabbits; they were so scared. </sentence><sentence id="554">Then, one by one, they would get up, pull up the skirts above their waist. </sentence><sentence id="555">And we kinda snickered, because here they were...we realized they were men. </sentence><sentence id="556">They were totally nude. </sentence><sentence id="557">The only thing they had for clothing on was this, uh, dress. </sentence><sentence id="558">And they would hold it above their waist; and they'd run and then dive behind another <span class="env feature">tree</span> and drop their skirt. </sentence><sentence id="559">And as I say, it was kind of humorous, at that point. </sentence><sentence id="560">But they [were] working their way to close to us. </sentence><sentence id="561">So I signaled for the men to skirmish and get ready for a gun fight, just in case. </sentence><sentence id="562">And we were all camouflaged, and, uh, so on. </sentence><sentence id="563">Then these men worked their way fairly close to us. </sentence><sentence id="564">And all of a sudden, I stood up  USHMM Archives RG-50.030*253 9 and I challenged them. </sentence><sentence id="565">I almost scared the living daylights out of them. </sentence><sentence id="566">They didn't know we were there. </sentence><sentence id="567">They dived in behind the <span class="env feature">trees</span>. </sentence><sentence id="568">And when they did, some of them started to cry, started to beg. </sentence><sentence id="569">Uh, one man finally came out. </sentence><sentence id="570">And I kept telling him in broken German, uh, "We are American solders." </sentence><sentence id="571">And, uh, tried to get them to understand that, uh, we were not, uh, going to harm them. </sentence><sentence id="572">And one man, in particular, came crawling out on his elbows and his knees--almost like a caterpillar. </sentence><sentence id="573">And he crawled quite fast. </sentence><sentence id="574">And he [was] working his way toward me; and then he turned around and put his hands up in the form of a prayer, and kept begging me in some foreign language, apparently not to kill him. </sentence><sentence id="575">And I tried to console him and uh...here again, tell him that we are Americans. </sentence><sentence id="576">He finally, suddenly, under...comprehended what I was trying to say. </sentence><sentence id="577">And he look...looked up, and said something in a foreign language. </sentence><sentence id="578">But... "American?" </sentence><sentence id="579">And I shook my head yes. </sentence><sentence id="580">He went like a machine gun across the <span class="interior space">floor</span>, came over to...uh, in front of me. </sentence><sentence id="581">Now, he was breaking down. </sentence><sentence id="582">And he was shivering all over his body; and he started kissing the <span class="env feature">ground</span> and started kissing my shoes, or my boots. </sentence><sentence id="583">And uh, then he wrapped his arms violently around my legs. </sentence><sentence id="584">And he was crying his heart out. </sentence><sentence id="585">And then he turned around; and he spoke in a foreign language to the others to come, and that it was safe. </sentence><sentence id="586">Here again, these prisoners were just like the ones back at <span class="populated place">Hadamar</span>--in a terrible, terrible shape. </sentence><sentence id="587">So I asked them in German, uh...uh, "Wo ist der deutsche Soldaten?"--"Where is the German soldier?" </sentence><sentence id="588">And they pointed down. </sentence><sentence id="589">We...(Clearing throat) I'll skip the rest of that part of the story, uh, to get to the better points. </sentence><sentence id="590">Uh, we took them...

and there was prisoners in front of me. </sentence><sentence id="598">And there was three groups. </sentence><sentence id="599">One group was coming up with <span class="spatial object">hay wagons</span> with bodies on them. </sentence><sentence id="600">As I remember, most all of them had clothing on. </sentence><sentence id="601">Uh, this is a very important point. </sentence><sentence id="602">Because I learned from President [Chaim] Herzog, uh, when I asked him, that "Why were some nude and some others not?" </sentence><sentence id="603">And he pointed out that, uh, the nude ones were usually Jews. </sentence><sentence id="604">Because they believed in their religion that the worst thing that could happen to them was to go to God in the nude. </sentence><sentence id="605">These prisoners, most of them were clothed, at that point. </sentence><sentence id="606">Or, the bodies on the <span class="spatial object">wagons</span>. </sentence><sentence id="607">And the prisoners were pushing the <span class="spatial object">wagons</span> up by hand. </sentence><sentence id="608">There was another group at that point coming in from the <span class="env feature">forest</span> carrying six-foot logs. </sentence><sentence id="609">The first group, in front of me, was taking the <span class="spatial object">logs</span> and laying them on the <span class="env feature">ground</span>, side by side. </sentence><sentence id="610">Then they were taking, uh, the bodies, and laying them across;

Here again, there was no flesh in their bodies, no muscles or anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="1007">Uh, we ran out between them. </sentence><sentence id="1008">And we held our rifles horizontal, and we tried to hold this massive crowd back. </sentence><sentence id="1009">At that point, uh, Whitey Hall""--another squad leader--was going by the main <span class="dlf">gate</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1010">And he saw we were in trouble; and he brought his men in--approximately eight or nine men--and he...they ran over and stood beside us, and tried to hold this crowd back. </sentence><sentence id="1011">And I called out to...here again, Applegate--which was a very tall man--uh, and I told him...I says, "You take these women out of here, and get them out of the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1012">Get them out of sight, so I can get control of the crowd." </sentence><sentence id="1013">So he doubletimed the women out of the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1014">Later, he come back and told me that he had marked them for war crimes. </sentence><sentence id="1015">We were beginning to understand there was something very wrong in this <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1016">So in the meantime, once he got them out of sight, uh, then I started talking to the crowd. </sentence><sentence id="1017">And I started telling them, "There's not going to be any killing. </sentence><sentence id="1018">It's all over. </sentence><sentence id="1019">You're free. </sentence><sentence id="1020">Do you understand this?" </sentence><sentence id="1021">And the crowd, of course, the...they were so infuriated at seeing these women that, uh...the...there was electricity in the <span class="env feature">air</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1022">The hatred, the bitterness was there. </sentence><sentence id="1023">And it was very obvious. </sentence><sentence id="1024">And so I kept telling them that I'm not going to permit any killing, and, uh, that "You're now free." </sentence><sentence id="1025">But they couldn't understand this. </sentence><sentence id="1026">And all of a sudden, in the crowd, uh, there was a lot of people talking very excitedly to certain people, which it turned out to be, uh, people who could speak English. </sentence><sentence id="1027">And so they would interpret these stories. </sentence><sentence id="1028">And they began--I remember this very distinctly--one of the first stories. </sentence><sentence id="1029">There was a Jewish woman right out in front of me. </sentence><sentence id="1030">And you couldn't tell very, uh, well a difference of a woman from a man in those <span class="populated place">camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1031">They were so badly starved that a woman's breast is totally dissolved by her body. </sentence><sentence id="1032">So there was no hourglass shape, or anything else. </sentence><sentence id="1033">They had basically the same clothing as the other prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="1034">Their hair was shaved off their heads. </sentence><sentence id="1035">Usually, I could identify by the tone of the voice whether they were male or female. </sentence><sentence id="1036">And this woman spoke out; and--in English--and she started telling me. </sentence><sentence id="1037">Uh, uh, she tried to describe what the German women--these German women-- were doing to these prisoners daily. </sentence><sentence id="1038">That they would take a group of perhaps 20 to 30 prisoners, and march them in two ranks to a specific part of the <span class="populated place">camp</span> where the <span class="dlf">slit trenches</span>--the <span class="spatial object">toilets</span>--were. </sentence><sentence id="1039">And now as I mentioned, there's no flesh on their bodies, so they could not physically resist anything. </sentence><sentence id="1040">One German woman,  USHMM Archives RG-50.030*253 13 as she described, would get down on her knees in front of a <span class="dlf">slit trench</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1041">She would reach up and grab two prisoners by the back of the head, force them down on their knees, force them to bend over. </sentence><sentence id="1042">And then push their faces in human excretion, and hold them there until they smothered to death. </sentence><sentence id="1043">All the time laughing. </sentence><sentence id="1044">As well as the other German women, who were surrounding the prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="1045">It was, uh...as she described it, was a daily game for them. </sentence><sentence id="1046">In the meantime, all the prisoners in the two ranks had to stand there and watch. </sentence><sentence id="1047">But also they had to understand that each and every one of them, this was going to be done to them before they were done. </sentence><sentence id="1048">And they did this daily. </sentence><sentence id="1049">Another person in the crowd called out. </sentence><sentence id="1050">And they...uh, he was yelling something about the dogs, the dogs. </sentence><sentence id="1051">And then he began talking about how the Germans--guards--some of them would be going with packs of dogs. </sentence><sentence id="1052">And at any time, they would suddenly just point to one of the prisoners and command the dogs to attack that prisoner and tear him apart viciously. </sentence><sentence id="1053">And as I have described to the kids in <span class="building">school</span> today, as bad as it was, at least that person...it was over for that particular person. </sentence><sentence id="1054">But for...the psychological thing that happened, and what the Germans were doing, was that they were putting the fear into all the others. </sentence><sentence id="1055">So they had to think from then on that, "When is it going to be my turn?" </sentence><sentence id="1056">The Germans, uh, we...we're learning that they could not simply just kill somebody; but they had to humiliate and they had to terrorize, all at the same time. </sentence><sentence id="1057">There were many other stories. </sentence><sentence id="1058">Another person in the crowd began calling out; and telling me, (clearing throat) here again, about the dogs. </sentence><sentence id="1059">That in the winter, that the German guards would select a prisoner--man or woman. </sentence><sentence id="1060">They were given--him or her--a <span class="spatial object">shower</span>, a hot <span class="spatial object">shower</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1061">And immediately take them out of the <span class="spatial object">shower</span> nude into the <span class="dlf">yard</span>, in the snow storm; and command them to sit there, surrounded, uh, by killer dogs who were, uh, placed...commanded to be on guard. </sentence><sentence id="1062">And this prisoner... Now the guards would go back into the <span class="building">barracks</span> and watch. </sentence><sentence id="1063">And this prisoner had a choice of sitting there in the snow storm and freezing to death, or move and have the dogs attack them. </sentence><sentence id="1064">And they went on telling me story after story. </sentence><sentence id="1065">And finally, I put my hands up. </sentence><sentence id="1066">And I told them, I said, "I've heard enough. </sentence><sentence id="1067">I don't want to hear anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1068">It's all over." </sentence><sentence id="1069">At that point, as I can remember, a little Frenchman in the crowd began to sing quietly, very hoarsely, the..."La Marseillaise"--the French national anthem. </sentence><sentence id="1070">As he began singing, then some others--spotted all through the crowd--began to sing along side of them. </sentence><sentence id="1071">Apparently, they were French. </sentence><sentence id="1072">Then, Bob Riggs came for me. </sentence><sentence id="1073">He said, "You'd better come with me." </sentence><sentence id="1074">So the rest.... These men.... Americans were still standing there, now that we had laid our weapons down. </sentence><sentence id="1075">Uh, but at that point, the survivors--as we now call them--began singing other songs that...that I didn't recognize. </sentence><sentence id="1076">We...Bob took me over to the <span class="building">barracks</span> of the women guards. </sentence><sentence id="1077">As we entered the <span class="interior space">room</span>, the first <span class="interior space">room</span> was a...what we in the army call a "<span class="interior space">day room</span>." </sentence><sentence id="1078">This is where, normally in the <span class="building">army</span>, you would write letters, read, and relax. </sentence><sentence id="1079">I was so shocked when I walked into this <span class="interior space">room</span> that I pretended I didn't see it. </sentence><sentence id="1080">And I turned my attention; and off to my right was a <span class="dlf">doorway</span> and a <span class="interior space">hallway</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1081">And I quietly... And now there were some of my men, a couple of my men coming in; there was a few survivors coming in. </sentence><sentence id="1082">Nobody at this point was talking. </sentence><sentence id="1083">And I went down the <span class="interior space">hallway</span>, and I looked into the <span class="interior space">bedrooms</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1084">And each one of the <span class="interior space">bedrooms</span> was neat, just like a normal army, uh, <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1085">Orderly. </sentence><sentence id="1086">All the uniforms were hung up on the left. </sentence><sentence id="1087">The <span class="spatial object">bunk</span> was made in a, uh...uh, military, uh, fashion. </sentence><sentence id="1088">Everything neat, and in its place. </sentence><sentence id="1089">Nothing was wrong. </sentence><sentence id="1090">And this puzzled me. </sentence><sentence id="1091">And I turned around, and I walked back out of the...away from the <span class="interior space">bedrooms</span>, and back into this <span class="interior space">room</span> again. </sentence><sentence id="1092">And in the <span class="interior space">room</span> was  USHMM Archives RG-50.030*253 14 <span class="spatial object">tables</span> all over the place. </sentence><sentence id="1093">On the <span class="spatial object">tables</span> were lamps. </sentence><sentence id="1094">Some of them had several <span class="spatial object">lamps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1095">The <span class="spatial object">lamps</span> themselves were made of human bones. </sentence><sentence id="1096">The <span class="spatial object">lamp shades</span> were made of human skin with tattoos. </sentence><sentence id="1097">I recognized that immediately. </sentence><sentence id="1098">I walked over and was starting to look at different ones, and tried to comprehend what all these things I was seeing. </sentence><sentence id="1099">The little French in...uh, uh, my interpreter now, the little Frenchman came over beside me. " </sentence><sentence id="1100">Monsieur, do you understand what that is?" </sentence><sentence id="1101">At this point, his face was covered with tears. </sentence><sentence id="1102">And I said, "What...it looks like human skin with tattoos." </sentence><sentence id="1103">He says, "Yes." </sentence><sentence id="1104">He says they would find a prisoner with the tattoos, and hold him or her down out here in the <span class="dlf">yard</span> in front of us. </sentence><sentence id="1105">And then they, uh, would actually skin them alive, these women. </sentence><sentence id="1106">He made a point that it was these German women. </sentence><sentence id="1107">They would actually skin them alive, somehow; and then hand the skin to the prisoners, who had to somehow cure and make these <span class="spatial object">lamp shades</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1108">On the <span class="dlf">walls</span> all around the <span class="interior space">room</span> were <span class="spatial object">picture frames</span>, all different sizes, with human skin and tattoos. </sentence><sentence id="1109">On the <span class="spatial object">shelves</span>...

They had already taken and cut open, uh, his chest, and taken his rib cage off. </sentence><sentence id="1156">And I remember on the left side of, uh...of him[, his <span class="interior space">rib cage</span>] was hanging on nails. </sentence><sentence id="1157">They had taken some of, uh, his intestines, and hung them on the right on nails. </sentence><sentence id="1158">And I could see his lungs--bluish and foamy-like looking--uh, pulsating inside of him. </sentence><sentence id="1159">In other words, they...they were dissecting him alive. </sentence><sentence id="1160">Experimenting on him. </sentence><sentence id="1161">And I didn't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="1162">You know, some of the other men behind me coming in now were getting shocked like that. </sentence><sentence id="1163">And I remember Goggleye saying, "What in the Hell are we going to do?" </sentence><sentence id="1164">I said, "Get outside the <span class="building">building</span> here." </sentence><sentence id="1165">Because we...our <span class="spatial object">radios</span>--uh, the <span class="spatial object">536</span>, we call it--uh, would not work inside the <span class="building">building</span> like they do today. </sentence><sentence id="1166">I said, "Get outside the <span class="building">building</span> here. </sentence><sentence id="1167">Call the <span class="building">company</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1168">Tell them what we've found." </sentence><sentence id="1169">Which he had already been reporting, uh...everything. " </sentence><sentence id="1170">And give them the name, the identification of this <span class="building">building</span> in particular. </sentence><sentence id="1171">Tell them, for God's sake, somewhere, get a hold of a doctor. </sentence><sentence id="1172">A surgeon, in particular; to try to help this man." </sentence><sentence id="1173">Then I ordered everybody to get out of that <span class="interior space">room</span>, so that perhaps we could save him and not give him any disease. </sentence><sentence id="1174">Because we were all filthy. </sentence><sentence id="1175">And so I sealed the <span class="interior space">room</span>...the <span class="interior space">room</span> off that way. </sentence><sentence id="1176">And then I went back to the, uh...the uh...group of the survivors. </sentence><sentence id="1177">And this [was] a <span class="env feature">sea</span> of humanity, of survivors, out there singing. </sentence><sentence id="1178">And I began talking a little bit with them again, and telling them that it's all over. </sentence><sentence id="1179">And it's about at this point that they began to understand that they were liberated. </sentence><sentence id="1180">Because now they turned and started looking at each other; and there was tears coming down their faces, but there were smiles. </sentence><sentence id="1181">They began to hug and kiss each other. </sentence><sentence id="1182">And you kno...of course, European men, especially, will kiss each other. </sentence><sentence id="1183">They began to take and hug each other...uh, and cry. </sentence><sentence id="1184">And they started, a lot of them, locking their arms together; and they began singing. </sentence><sentence id="1185">And it was very, very emotional thing to see. </sentence><sentence id="1186">And as I say, it was the beginning of them really understanding that they were liberated. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1419">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="1420">No, uh, that I did not. </sentence><sentence id="1421">Uh, I have often wondered about that; and people have asked me about that man. </sentence><sentence id="1422">Uh, we had to leave him in that condition. </sentence><sentence id="1423">And (clearing throat) so we turned; and we started, side-by-side, walking down this main <span class="dlf">street</span> with thousands of the survivors. </sentence><sentence id="1424">And I don't... And I'm not exaggerating. </sentence><sentence id="1425">This <span class="populated place">camp</span> must have been huge. </sentence><sentence id="1426">And they were all walking behind us, very quietly. </sentence><sentence id="1427">And, of course, I turned around a couple of times; and I told them, "You people go back. </sentence><sentence id="1428">Because we're going to start shooting now, and I don't want you people hurt." </sentence><sentence id="1429">But they stayed right with us. </sentence><sentence id="1430">And it was almost like a parade. </sentence><sentence id="1431">And shortly, we came to the first <span class="building">houses</span> on the outskirts of the <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1432">And suddenly, a woman--a German woman--come running out the right hand side, uh, toward me. </sentence><sentence id="1433">And she, apparently, knew that I was the commanding, uh, man in this group. </sentence><sentence id="1434">She reached me and grabbed me by the shirt, and locked her hands into my shirt. </sentence><sentence id="1435">And she began begging me. </sentence><sentence id="1436">And she said, "I was teacher in <span class="country">America</span>, in <span class="populated place">Cleveland</span>, <span class="region">Ohio</span>, uh, before the war." </sentence><sentence id="1437">And then she looked around. </sentence><sentence id="1438">She was scared. </sentence><sentence id="1439">And she started telling me that she didn't know anything of what was going on in that <span class="populated place">camp</span>. " </sentence><sentence id="1440">I didn't know! </sentence><sentence id="1441">I didn't know!" </sentence><sentence id="1442">And I became rather infuriated at that point. </sentence><sentence id="1443">And I turned around. </sentence><sentence id="1444">Now all the...most of the European people are smaller than we are, except for the German people. </sentence><sentence id="1445">And I turned around; and here's a <span class="env feature">sea</span> of humanity. </sentence><sentence id="1446">And I could see over the top of their heads. </sentence><sentence id="1447">And I could see the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, uh, which wasn't very far from us. </sentence><sentence id="1448">I could see the <span class="dlf">gates</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1449">I could see the <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1450">I could see the <span class="building">towers</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1451">And I could actually see the...the hanging ropes, where we cut all these people down. </sentence><sentence id="1452">And incidently, in those ropes... Hopper had come to me, uh, earlier, and he brought me over there after they cut them down. </sentence><sentence id="1453">And these people--most of them that had clothing on--they tied their wrists behind them, and then they hung them by the wrist backwards. </sentence><sentence id="1454">There was two people, two men, that were nude. </sentence><sentence id="1455">They tied their wrists behind them and...with piano wire; and then they took a hook of some kind, and they ran it through their privates. </sentence><sentence id="1456">And they hung them upside down and left them that way. </sentence><sentence id="1457">Which is an appalling thing to do to somebody. </sentence><sentence id="1458">Anyway, this woman came to me. </sentence><sentence id="1459">And she [was] telling...trying to tell me that she didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="1460">The odor of this whole <span class="region">area</span> was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="1461">And then I turned back to her, after looking back at the <span class="populated place">camp</span> and even seeing the <span class="dlf">ropes</span> from this distance; and I slapped her hard across the face. </sentence><sentence id="1462">I was infur...I was furious. </sentence><sentence id="1463">And I called her a...a damn liar. </sentence><sentence id="1464">And she fell to the <span class="env feature">ground</span>, let go of my shirt. </sentence><sentence id="1465">And she was crying. </sentence><sentence id="1466">And we all walked around her and kept on going. </sentence><sentence id="1467">All of a sudden...and I ordered my men then... Now, [when] we got to the <span class="building">buildings</span>, I said, "Some of you guys start going through these...this <span class="building">building</span> over here. </sentence><sentence id="1468">Some of you guys start going through there." </sentence><sentence id="1469">All of a sudden, the...the survivors themselves began running like mad. </sentence><sentence id="1470">And I said, "Whoa!" </sentence><sentence id="1471">I started yelling at them, "Whoa! </sentence><sentence id="1472">Wait a minute!Come back here!" </sentence><sentence id="1473">I says, "You can't go in there. </sentence><sentence id="1474">There's going to be shooting. </sentence><sentence id="1475">And they're  USHMM Archives RG-50.030*253 17 going to go there." </sentence><sentence id="1476">And I says, uh...and I realized now, looking at this massive crowd that there's no way 16 of us are gonna, uh, control this mob--especially if they get excited. </sentence><sentence id="1477">So I told them, "Okay. </sentence><sentence id="1478">Go ahead. </sentence><sentence id="1479">You help find the...the German soldier." " </sentence><sentence id="1480">But," I says, "He's my prisoner. </sentence><sentence id="1481">You bring him back here, and you put him right there on the <span class="env feature">ground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1482">I'll stay right here." </sentence><sentence id="1483">So I stood in the middle of the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1484">My men and the survivors started going through all the <span class="building">buildings</span>, all the <span class="interior space">closets</span>, and everything else. </sentence><sentence id="1485">They found...actually found armed, uh, Wehrmacht soldiers, uh, and dragged them down the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1486">They were spitting at them. </sentence><sentence id="1487">They were kicking at them, and all this; but they, uh, abided by my rule, and they brought them and threw them on the <span class="env feature">ground</span> beside me. </sentence><sentence id="1488">When I...I noticed that they would start getting excited and start talking like mad, then I would tell them, "Okay. </sentence><sentence id="1489">Go find me some more, uh, German soldiers." </sentence><sentence id="1490">And they'd take off and they'd start scattering, running again. </sentence><sentence id="1491">When they did that, then I ordered one of my men to take these prisoners; and take them back behind and turn them over as prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="1492">I didn't want a massacre here. </sentence><sentence id="1493">We finally came to the edge of the <span class="populated place">city</span>, after going through. </sentence><sentence id="1494">There wasn't much of a fight in the <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1495">The...most of everybody had deserted. </sentence><sentence id="1496">And then Captain...uh, the Colonel of our battalion ordered us into the <span class="env feature">woods</span> instead. </sentence><sentence id="1497">Uh, which was normal procedure; because we knew once the German army found out that we had taken the <span class="populated place">city</span>, that they would actually blow up their own <span class="populated place">city</span> with artillery. </sentence><sentence id="1498">So I turned around to the survivors. </sentence><sentence id="1499">And I told them...I said, "Now, I want all of you to go back. </sentence><sentence id="1500">We're going in the <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1501">All of you go back to the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, where you're gonna be safe. </sentence><sentence id="1502">Because now the Germans are going to shell the <span class="populated place">city</span>, and blow...destroy it. </sentence><sentence id="1503">And I don't want you people hurt." </sentence><sentence id="1504">They abided; and they turned around. </sentence><sentence id="1505">Uh, many of them throwing kisses to us, and that kind of thing (clearing throat) there. </sentence><sentence id="1506">The...We went into the <span class="env feature">woods</span> and dug in for the night. </sentence><sentence id="1507">And then I started to walk from <span class="dlf">hole</span> to <span class="dlf">hole</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1508">Little <span class="dlf">foxholes</span>, two men usually in each <span class="dlf">hole</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1509">And I was checking for the positions, to make sure they were digging in the right position for defense and all that. </sentence><sentence id="1510">As I came to each <span class="dlf">hole</span>--and I'm standing up in the dead of night, and I'm looking down at the men--and I believe that every single man was crying. </sentence><sentence id="1511">And they'd look up at me; and generally, the gist of it was that most of them looked up at me and said...asked me, "Why?" </sentence><sentence id="1512">Of course, I understood what they were asking me. </sentence><sentence id="1513">Why did the Germans do that to those people? </sentence><sentence id="1514">And I had no answer for them. </sentence><sentence id="1515">The next morning, or sometime during the night, we moved out. </sentence><sentence id="1516">And we began engaging the German Army and chasing them through the <span class="env feature">woods</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1517">And, uh, we came to a huge <span class="env feature">valley</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1518">The entire battalion came to the <span class="env feature">valley</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1519">And the Germans were across the <span class="env feature">valley</span>... and with ack-ack batteries. </sentence><sentence id="1520">And they were firing...now firing at us. </sentence><sentence id="1521">So that Colonel Hook decided that the only way to take them was to order us to, uh, spread out as far as we could, and stand up and walk across the entire <span class="env feature">valley</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1522">And which we did. </sentence><sentence id="1523">As we got...uh, I had one of the <span class="dlf">points</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1524">In other words, the foremost troops in the group. </sentence><sentence id="1525">And as we come to the edge of the, uh, <span class="env feature">hills</span> and started to go up the <span class="env feature">hills</span>, the Germans that were up there on the <span class="spatial object">artillery guns</span> began to desert their guns and run. </sentence><sentence id="1526">We climbed up and began [to] overrun the <span class="spatial object">guns</span> themselves. </sentence><sentence id="1527">And at this point, I noticed two of my new men, that, uh, just came into combat for the first time, had three German SS prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="1528">The SS wore different uniforms entirely than the Wehrmacht did. </sentence><sentence id="1529">And I noticed...at that point, I ran...began to run over to where they were. </sentence><sentence id="1530">And I fired a shot at one of them. </sentence><sentence id="1531">One of the SS troopers had his hands down like this. </sentence><sentence id="1532">And I fired a shot at his feet; and I yelled for him to "Hands hoch!"-- [to] put his hands high. </sentence><sentence id="1533">And my two men began to call out, "Well, we got the situation well  USHMM Archives RG-50.030*253 18 in hand." </sentence><sentence id="1534">And I told them they were crazy; that they were almost dead men. </sentence><sentence id="1535">And I pointed out that the one SS trooper with his hands down low was reaching down to touch the buckle on his belt. </sentence><sentence id="1536">It was a big brass buckle, with a <span class="spatial object">Swastika</span> and so on on it. </sentence><sentence id="1537">Touch a button, the heavy brass buckle dropped down. </sentence><sentence id="1538">Instantly, three little tiny <span class="spatial object">barrels</span> of 22 shots drop down and would fire directly into your <span class="interior space">belly</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1539">And we.... Thus, we called them "<span class="spatial object">belly guns</span>." </sentence><sentence id="1540">And so all this time that I was chastising my men and teaching them this, I was watching the eyes--or the faces--of these SS troopers. </sentence><sentence id="1541">They had the Death|["s]-Head SS insignia on them. </sentence><sentence id="1542">So then I knew by the expression on their face, that one...which one could speak English. </sentence><sentence id="1543">And I addressed him immediately. </sentence><sentence id="1544">And I said, "Were you men in this <span class="populated place">camp</span> behind us?" </sentence><sentence id="1545">And the SS trooper looked at me, and he realized I knew he spoke English. </sentence><sentence id="1546">And he said, "Yes." </sentence><sentence id="1547">And then I searched for a question. </sentence><sentence id="1548">And I knew it was ridiculous for me to ask him why they put people behind the <span class="building">prison</span>...behind <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span>, why they tortured them and murdered them and all this; because of the attitude of the <span class="country">German nation</span> at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1549">So I finally decided; and asked him, "Well, why didn't you, at least, take care of the...treat the diseases in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>?" </sentence><sentence id="1550">And he look at me, and he stood erect. </sentence><sentence id="1551">And he said, "Why should we? </sentence><sentence id="1552">They were all going to die anyway." </sentence><sentence id="1553">And I had everything I could do to control my temper, and not kill the three of them right then and there. </sentence><sentence id="1554">So I reached out, and I grabbed the, uh...the, uh...the Death["s]-Head insignia off all three of them. </sentence><sentence id="1555">I took the belly gun off the one; and I took another belt buckle off the...off a second one. </sentence><sentence id="1556">And (clearing throat) with our morals.... And people have asked me many times since then, "At the scene, or leaving the <span class="populated place">camp</span>... When you left the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, why didn't you go into the <span class="populated place">city</span> and shoot every German that you found?" </sentence><sentence id="1557">And the only answer I have is that because the Germans--or the German SS troopers, in particular--became animals in those days didn't mean that I could lower myself to those standards. </sentence><sentence id="1558">And that was a very, very important part, or fact[or], in those days: that we had to have something to stand by and believe in. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1701">Q: Uh, did you interrogate these, uh, three SS men, uh, any further, or did they go off...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1703">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="1704">Uh, we just uh searched them thoroughly and, uh, made sure that they didn't have any weapons, or any--like the SS normal...very often did--have, uh, TNT inside their shirts. </sentence><sentence id="1705">And they...at times, they would actually blow themselves up--and you with them--as you searched them. </sentence><sentence id="1706">But we, uh...we searched them thoroughly. </sentence><sentence id="1707">And then, uh, I detailed one man to take them back as prisoners and turn them over to...to our <span class="building">company headquarters</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1708">And...and thus back to a <span class="populated place">prison camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1709">But they were marked as war crimes, as were the German women guards at the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, uh, there. </sentence><sentence id="1710">Uh, now, we really didn't understand what would happen to them from that point on. </sentence><sentence id="1711">Except that they would...we hoped, would draw more attention than the other prisoners would, uh, that we would turn back to them. </sentence></p></dialogue>

But then I began to understand the German mind. </sentence><sentence id="2170">Of course, there were many other things that came out of this. </sentence><sentence id="2171">Of their attitudes of the German occupation of these <span class="country">countries</span>, and so on; and their intimidation and their firing squads, and why, are there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2176">Q: In all your experience that you've already described to us, what were your feelings? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2178">What...what would you like to say about it? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2179">A: All right. </sentence><sentence id="2180">Of course, uh, after, uh...at the very end of the war there, we did overrun--right somewhere in that immediate vicinity--and only saw part of one of the <span class="populated place">Mauthausens</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2181">There was 42, as I understand now. </sentence><sentence id="2182">And we saw some awful horrors there. </sentence><sentence id="2183">And even, uh, cannibalism in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2184">But these... Like <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2185">And we were so shocked. </sentence><sentence id="2186">And Professor Crawford asked me after the war, he said... Now, he asked me the same question about my emotions, how I felt...thought about it. </sentence><sentence id="2187">And he asked me another question, "Did you men during the war--after you left the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, or after the war, or even at <span class="building">home</span>--talk about these terrible <span class="populated place">camps</span> and these horrors that you saw?" </sentence><sentence id="2188">And I suddenly realized, number one, that all this time I had been assuming that as we radioed--like, for instance, in <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>--that we radioed back constantly all the things that we were finding to the <span class="building">company</span>; to be reported, we assumed, on the, uh, daily reports of the military, that here they, uh...all the reports itself  USHMM Archives RG-50.030*253 24 would be turned in. </sentence><sentence id="2189">But I also assumed that due to us communicating with the men behind us, that all of a sudden everybody in the battalion would be coming into the <span class="populated place">camp</span> and taking a look at all these horrors that we saw. </sentence><sentence id="2190">It didn't happen. </sentence><sentence id="2191">Nobody came. </sentence><sentence id="2192">And we were ordered out, to go help the battalion fight for the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2193">I found out since that somebody in the <span class="region">division</span> has deleted every single word of every <span class="populated place">camp</span> all over <span class="country">Germany</span> that we had entered. </sentence><sentence id="2194">Every single word had been disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="2195">Nobody seemed to care. </sentence><sentence id="2196">Of the human misery, or anything else there. </sentence><sentence id="2197">And this shocked me. </sentence><sentence id="2198">But at the end of the war--without even knowing about this, but just assuming that everybody else around me and the company had gone in--it was so distasteful to remember this that we tried to shut it off. </sentence><sentence id="2199">We did not ever talk amongst each other about one single word about any of these things that happened in the <span class="populated place">camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2200">From the shock, from all the human misery, uh, in <span class="country">France</span>, <span class="country">Belgium</span>....the misery among ourselves, the misery about all the Germans that we shot and left wounded on the <span class="env feature">ground</span>, crying and begging...uh, to the German civilians who were bombed and fire-bombed. </sentence><sentence id="2201">It was total misery all the time we were over there. </sentence><sentence id="2202">So, by the end of the war, we became very, very bitter men. </sentence><sentence id="2203">And it took us a long time to come out of this bitterness. </sentence><sentence id="2204">Of the human misery. </sentence><sentence id="2205">Not so much, uh, because of the war and what the Germans did, but the...all the misery that we had seen, of everybody. </sentence><sentence id="2206">Uh, those are terrible, terrible memories. </sentence><sentence id="2207">And for 40 years, approximately, I buried all those memories in my mind. </sentence><sentence id="2208">When I came back <span class="building">home</span>, I remember trying to tell some of the adventures, some of the things that happened to me. </sentence><sentence id="2209">And everybody--my friends, my family--the minute you'd start talking about the war at all, they'd say, "Forget it. </sentence><sentence id="2210">It's all over. </sentence><sentence id="2211">We don't want to hear it. </sentence><sentence id="2212">We don't care." </sentence><sentence id="2213">And this... And I actually was even humiliated. " </sentence><sentence id="2214">Oh. </sentence><sentence id="2215">You were in the big one!" </sentence><sentence id="2216">And things like that. </sentence><sentence id="2217">And becoming embarrassed or humiliated like that, that you'd bottle the things up even deeper. </sentence><sentence id="2218">So finally when Professor Crawford approached me the first time, and I began to remember some. </sentence><sentence id="2219">When I first started to testify and talk about it, even for the first few years, I could only remember just so much. </sentence><sentence id="2220">And it was all kind of jumbled, and locations were jumbled in my mind. </sentence><sentence id="2221">After a while, all of a sudden, things started to straighten out. </sentence><sentence id="2222">But I have not had a nightmare since. </sentence><sentence id="2223">And that's a very big point, uh, there. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2271">A: Uh, there is so very many stories of human misery and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2272">But pertaining to the <span class="populated place">camps</span>...uh... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2275">Q: You've been very, very helpful in this...in this very unpleasant recollection. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2277">A: It is...very unpleasant. </sentence><sentence id="2278">I hope that people can understand, uh, what it was like. </sentence><sentence id="2279">Hmm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
