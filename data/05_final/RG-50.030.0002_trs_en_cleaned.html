<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="121">Q: Were there social and cultural activities? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="123">A: At one time I know my mother used to go to all those fancy <span class="spatial object">charity balls</span>, a lot of them. </sentence><sentence id="124">And I think closer to the war, there were a couple Jewish charity balls. </sentence><sentence id="125">I think she still used to go to the <span class="spatial object">Red Cross ball</span> and so on. </sentence><sentence id="126">But there were less social contact. </sentence><sentence id="127">My mother had a friend, a <span class="building">school</span> friend, who was of a German decent, a very, very prominent family. </sentence><sentence id="128">They owned big <span class="building">factories</span>, and she married a Polish boy. </sentence><sentence id="129">They were patients for years and years and years. </sentence><sentence id="130">They used to socialize, and then closer to the war, that dried out. </sentence><sentence id="131">We didn't have those contacts as such. </sentence></p></dialogue>

the things. </sentence><sentence id="582">I think there were 750 to 900 calories a day what we were getting at that time. </sentence><sentence id="583">And just before the winter they decided to give

children were being taken voluntarily by the parents, taken down, because they couldn't hide them. </sentence><sentence id="626">The moment the family would hide a child, the rations would be taken away, so not only the child didn't have the rations, but the family wouldn't have the rations. </sentence><sentence id="627">Our next door neighbors had hidden a child and they struggled. </sentence><sentence id="628">Unfortunately she died later, but it was -- and then they were taking the old people. </sentence><sentence id="629">They would make you line up on the <span

id="637">Just sit quiet, don't open the <span class="dlf">window</span>, don't stand next to <span class="dlf">windows</span>. </sentence><sentence id="638">At that time she had hidden some children

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1249">A: I think so. </sentence><sentence id="1250">I think they were coming from <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> because the other ones were Hungarians. </sentence><sentence id="1251">Can I tell you something interesting about -- by that time, we didn't have a doctor and they brought a bunch of women from the <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> uprising, gentile women. </sentence><sentence id="1252">They were not with us, but they brought one of the doctors to us to work with us and one of the women somehow when there was another nurse and I and my mother and people were coming in with various ailments, there was one lady who was from <span class="country">Germany</span>, had lost her husband and child. </sentence><sentence id="1253">She was not Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1254">Her husband was Jewish, and she kind of started becoming administrator to the very end. </sentence><sentence

</sentence><sentence id="1257">She survived. </sentence><sentence id="1258">So, we would sleep -- it was so cold, but we would sleep, this Polish doctor, and Lisa and my mother and I would take one blanket and put it underneath us on the shavings and would cover ourselves with the three other blankets. </sentence><sentence id="1259">It was much warmer. </sentence><sentence id="1260">And the body

very <span class="dlf">front</span> they made a out of the shavings covered with blanket. </sentence><sentence id="1272">How they got a candle, I do not know, but they had a tiny little candle.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1327">A: They had access to it. </sentence><sentence id="1328">It was part of the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, but this was a separate little <span class="building">building</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1329">That's when we started seeing the two I don't know what you call it, the German -- they were like medial corps men, or something. </sentence><sentence id="1330">One was a decent guy, his name was Fisher. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1331">And he liked to grab the girls" boobs. </sentence><sentence id="1332">So, we gave him a name of Fisher Tapper. </sentence><sentence id="1333">Tapper in Jewish is to tap, to grab it, and he liked to grab whenever he could when no one else was looking. </sentence><sentence id="1334">The other one was obnoxious. </sentence><sentence id="1335">He was a young fellow and we called him the pig, so I don't know his name. </sentence><sentence id="1336">And <span class="building">Doctor Schnabbles</span> started coming in. </sentence><sentence id="1337">He was an elderly man, according to rumors again, he was a nose and ear man. </sentence><sentence id="1338">He was checking what patients and what cases we have. </sentence><sentence id="1339">One of the first patients which he started doing something with, was a woman came on the <span class="spatial object">transport</span>, had a compound fracture of her tibia. </sentence><sentence id="1340">The skin was broken, the bone was sticking out. </sentence><sentence id="1341">It was a horror. </sentence><sentence id="1342">They put some kind of a <span class="spatial object">metal frame</span> around it and she had to be operated on. </sentence><sentence id="1343">So, he decided -- first of all, it was cool. </sentence><sentence id="1344">He never would take off his coat. </sentence><sentence id="1345">He did all his surgeries in his coat. </sentence><sentence id="1346">He decided to set the <span class="dlf">leg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1347">Well, he was not very successful. </sentence><sentence id="1348">So, the pediatrician opened up her mouth and said, "Doctor, don't you think you should do this and that?" </sentence><sentence id="1349">Well, that was the end of her. </sentence><sentence id="1350">She was ugly as it is, he didn't like it with the scars and all on her face, but that put her in disfavor. </sentence><sentence id="1351">We had two guys were watching, he tried to set the <span class="dlf">leg</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1352">He never did. </sentence><sentence id="1353">The woman was crippled. </sentence><sentence id="1354">She survived the war, I think, but she was in the <span class="building">hospital</span> with us all the time. </sentence><sentence id="1355"> 1 Tape #3 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1356">A: So, the first time he started setting that <span class="dlf">leg</span>, it never took. </sentence><sentence id="1357">Well, <span class="populated place">Schnabble</span> was looking always for patients, what he could operate on. </sentence><sentence id="1358">He was always checking what we have. </sentence><sentence id="1359">At that time, our staff consisted of Lisa, who the director of the <span class="building">hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1360">We had a scribe because they wanted reports. </sentence><sentence id="1361">How many patients were admitted, what they were coming in for, what sicknesses we had and stuff like this. </sentence><sentence id="1362">There must have been six or seven nurses, and then we had two orderly ladies. </sentence><sentence id="1363">We even had like a little <span class="spatial object">toilet</span> in the back. </sentence><sentence id="1364">Those two women had to take the stuff out, but we had like a little <span class="building">outhouse</span> attached to the <span class="building">hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1365">I don't remember what we had later, but that one I knew we had. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1378">A: At that time, they took the Polish woman away, there was my friend Alena, Doctor and Doctor Annie, the Russian woman, who didn't know much about medicine, but she was there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1381">Q: How many of the nurses really had any medical training? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1383">A: Very few. </sentence><sentence id="1384">What I had was like a practical nurse whatever I picked up, so did my girlfriend Alena. </sentence><sentence id="1385">There were one or two, there was one Dutch, she came and there was another one, a <span class="country">Belgium</span> that really had training or not, but we did what we could do. </sentence><sentence id="1386">Let's put it this way. </sentence><sentence id="1387">It was more than the other people could do. </sentence><sentence id="1388">And then I had a little <span class="building">dental office</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1389">We had also all kinds of patients and they were there forever. </sentence><sentence id="1390">Some of them died, some of them we let out. </sentence><sentence id="1391">Basically, a lot of surgical things. </sentence><sentence id="1392">I remember there was one young girl who claimed she could never get up and we tried to get her up, and we could never get her up. </sentence><sentence id="1393">Sometimes we climbed up and to get her out of the <span class="spatial object">bed</span> to straighten out that mess, and never knew what was wrong with her. </sentence><sentence id="1394">One day she just died, so evidently there was something wrong with her. </sentence><sentence id="1395">There was another young girl she had a groin abscess which was draining for weeks and months. </sentence><sentence id="1396">I mean the woman with the leg, I remember once I wanted to wash my famous dress, I mean we had nothing. </sentence><sentence id="1397">So, if you wanted to wash a dress you borrowed something from a patient and wore that for a day and washed the dress and the patient was lying naked. </sentence><sentence id="1398">Conditions were pretty horrid, but as I said, they were still feeding us. </sentence><sentence id="1399">We got the bread in the morning, and we, the personnel didn't have to stay and it was getting cold. </sentence><sentence id="1400">We also had a young girl who was a mental patient, whether she was manic-depressant, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1401">One day, Schnabble came in and decided to do some kind of a surgery, and we didn't have electricity so they brought carbide lights. </sentence><sentence id="1402">She got frantic. </sentence><sentence id="1403">Something was going on in the other <span class="interior space">room</span> and the lights. </sentence><sentence id="1404">This was a scene like . </sentence><sentence id="1405">She went wild. </sentence><sentence id="1406">We  2 her about two or three days in the <span class="building">tent</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1407">My mother was petrified that she's going to kill me, but she kept calm. </sentence><sentence id="1408">I mean, you could talk to her a little bit, you couldn't get the story out of her. </sentence><sentence id="1409">After that outburst, that place where we give her the injection, that festered and eventually she died. </sentence><sentence id="1410">She had an infection. </sentence><sentence id="1411">When we knew Schnabble was coming, we used to put the straight jacket on her, because she was so petrified. </sentence><sentence id="1412">When he walked in, we all had to stand at attention. </sentence><sentence id="1413">We couldn't move. </sentence><sentence id="1414">The only person who ever moved was one of the little orderlies. </sentence><sentence id="1415">She was a little woman, blonde nose, no teeth. </sentence><sentence id="1416">She was a young woman, bow legged, and she wanted to show him that she was working, so she would sweep the <span class="interior space">floor</span>, including his feet. </sentence><sentence id="1417">It was a riot, and he used to say, "The only one who works here is this one, the little one. </sentence><sentence id="1418">She's the only one who's working." </sentence><sentence id="1419">As I said, she would sweep over his books, and he liked her. </sentence><sentence id="1420">He never did anything in any way to stop her. </sentence><sentence id="1421">Well, one of the first opportunities he had to send Doctor out, they  3 separate <span class="interior space">room</span> for the staff. </sentence><sentence id="1422">I think we were doing the outpatient in the same <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1423">I finally beg <span class="spatial object">hospital beds</span> a small little <span class="interior space">room</span> which was my mother's <span class="building">office</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1424">In the back, at that time, they brought in a group of women from <span class="country">Slovakia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1425">I don't know if they were Jewish or not, with children. </sentence><sentence id="1426">They had little children with them, and they built like an <span class="interior space">annex</span> to our <span class="building">hospital</span>, at the end of our <span class="building">hospital</span> they were getting more firewood to warm up the place. </sentence><sentence id="1427">They were getting some special soups, and they had some little possessions with them. </sentence><sentence id="1428">They had <span class="spatial

of junk, medical supplies and all kinds of odds and ends. </sentence><sentence id="1430">I was in charge of all the medical supplies. </sentence><sentence id="1431">Whenever I got any vitamins I would take it to the children, because I felt that this was very important for the mothers, so I became very friendly with them. </sentence><sentence id="1432">Anything with baby powder, whatever they found and the Germans wouldn't use I started packages and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1433">A little cough medicine for children, pediatrics, so I would take it to those women. </sentence><sentence id="1434">Later on they helped me. </sentence><sentence id="1435">Anyway, it was getting cold, it was getting very, very nasty. </sentence><sentence id="1436">The weather was getting nasty. </sentence><sentence id="1437">One day a young woman came with pain -- and you see by that time we had a couple of other doctors, I think. </sentence><sentence id="1438">We tried to avoid telling Schnabble what was wrong with the patient. </sentence><sentence id="1439">We didn't have the means to diagnose. </sentence><sentence id="1440">We had no blood tests. </sentence><sentence id="1441">We had no x- rays, it was just feel and think. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1501">Q: Were people coming in for all kinds of conditions? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1503">A: Everything, and I can tell you, describe the conditions. </sentence><sentence id="1504">There was one thing, dental condition, which I think it's called , where pieces of gums and lips would rot,  4 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1505">A: We found that when they came with the blister and when we pierced the blister and drained it, and had some dressing we put it on, maybe some antiseptic powder, whatever we had we tried, somehow we could close the blister if it wasn't too advanced case of it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1507">Q: Did you have enough supplies? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1509">A: No, I'll tell you about that later. </sentence><sentence id="1510">Anyway, that one time this was one of the most horrid stories I ever saw. </sentence><sentence id="1511">A young woman came in and the suspicion was that she had appendix inflamed. </sentence><sentence id="1512">It just happened that Schnabble walked in and he heard what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="1513">What do you have. </sentence><sentence id="1514">See, we had to give them reports, and at one time this one medical guy used to stay the doctors have to stay at the <span class="dlf">stairs</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1515">When he comes in in the morning to pick up the reports, he doesn't want to get off the <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1516">You had to hand him that while he was on the run. </sentence><sentence id="1517">He was awful, screaming, yelling. </sentence><sentence id="1518">Anyway, Schnabble came in and found out that girl is complaining about appendix. </sentence><sentence id="1519">He decided he is going to operate. </sentence><sentence id="1520">Felt her around, I think he put rubber gloves on or whether his leather gloves, again, he wearing his coat. </sentence><sentence id="1521">We set up the surgery in the <span class="building">dental office</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1522">He ordered his help, the Russian boys should bring some wood, so they brought some wood. </sentence><sentence id="1523">It was raining. </sentence><sentence id="1524">It was sleeting, so I started a fire in that little wooden <span class="spatial object">stove</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1525">He assigned my mother to the anesthesia. </sentence><sentence id="1526">She was his favorite anesthetist. </sentence><sentence id="1527">The anesthesia consisted of a little <span class="spatial object">mask</span>, a little <span class="interior space">cage</span> that goes and you drip ether drop by drop from the <span class="spatial object">bottle</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1528">No other support, nothing. </sentence><sentence id="1529">Annie was helping him, two guys were standing there, and I think he had one other girl, a nurse to assist, and I was the dirty nurse at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1530">He opened her up, couldn't find her appendix. </sentence><sentence id="1531">He saw something and he said, well, I don't know that looks suspicious, he was ready to cut this out. </sentence><sentence id="1532">This was the <span class="spatial object">bladder</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1533">It looks like a <span class="env feature">fish bladder</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1534">He poked around. </sentence><sentence id="1535">He decided he can't find the appendix. </sentence><sentence id="1536">He took all the intestines out. </sentence><sentence id="1537">And the conditions are not sterile exactly. </sentence><sentence id="1538">I mean the fire which was going there, it's full of soot and he can't find it. </sentence><sentence id="1539">Put everything back together, took everything out again. </sentence><sentence id="1540">He still can't find her appendix. </sentence><sentence id="1541">At that time he barked to one of the guys, go bring <span class="populated place">Alenluf</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1542">Alenluf was a Greek doctor, I don't know if he was the main <span class="building">compound</span> or where he was, but he was in the <span class="populated place">men's camp</span>, and I understand he was a very known surgeon. </sentence><sentence id="1543">Well, a guy went on the <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> and Doctor Alenluf was running after him. </sentence><sentence id="1544">In the meantime, we kind of kept covered and kept the ether slow, not to have her in a deep sleep. </sentence><sentence id="1545">I grab Alenluf's coat and put a pair of rubber gloves on him. </sentence><sentence id="1546">That's what I manage because by now he's very impatient. </sentence><sentence id="1547">Alenluf looked in and found the appendix which was not infected at all, and closed her up. </sentence><sentence id="1548">She developed peritonitis. </sentence><sentence id="1549">For three days that woman was in a coma screaming and he was coming in. </sentence><sentence id="1550">He sent morphine. </sentence><sentence id="1551">He sent painkillers. </sentence><sentence id="1552">He also sent diet soup for her and white bread, but she couldn't eat anything. </sentence><sentence id="1553">It lasted three days, and she died. </sentence><sentence id="1554">But this was a horror. </sentence><sentence id="1555">And you can't say anything, and he's pulling out all of her intestines out on the <span class="spatial object">table</span> and back into the <span class="interior space">cavity</span> and back on the <span class="spatial object">table</span> and back in the <span class="interior space">cavity</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1556">It was a horror. </sentence><sentence id="1557">And you have to stand there with a poker face and don't say a word, nothing. </sentence><sentence id="1558">You can't react. </sentence><sentence id="1559">And even this Doctor Alenluf, very gingerly worked and did whatever he had to do, and he didn't say you did wrong, nothing. </sentence><sentence id="1560">He just did his job and that's it. </sentence><sentence id="1561">This was one of the worst things which I witnessed. </sentence><sentence id="1562">Now the funny thing happened with those slovak women. </sentence><sentence id="1563">We had a bunch of  5 syringes and we had various -- like I said, you asked about supplies, we would write that we need so and so many bandages and so many aspirins, we need so much -- they would cut it down in half, but they would bring us stuff. </sentence><sentence id="1564">And we had some pain killers and we had something if someone had an attack of something. </sentence><sentence id="1565">We also had babies. </sentence><sentence id="1566">There were babies born. </sentence><sentence id="1567">We had one woman once who knocked on the <span

woman in labor. </sentence><sentence id="1568">None of us is a midwife. </sentence><sentence id="1569">So, they came in. </sentence><sentence id="1570">The two guys, and they went from <span class="building">barrack</span> to <span class="building">barrack</span> and they found a midwife and the baby was delivered. </sentence><sentence id="1571">I think Schnabble showed up so he called him Joseph Von Jordan, because there was a <span class="dlf">ditch</span> over there and he said this is <span class="env feature">River Jordan</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1572">And the following day he sent a few diapers and something, there were a few of them, but the baby eventually died because the conditions were so bad that those infants could not survive. </sentence><sentence id="1573">But, they didn't take away the babies. </sentence><sentence id="1574">They didn't kill the babies. </sentence><sentence id="1575">They didn't do any harm to them. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1703">A: This was in "44, had to be around winter of "44, because it was getting cold when we lived in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, when we had those surgeries. </sentence><sentence id="1704">Also, when they were bringing the soups to the <span class="building">hospital</span>, there were a bunch of wild women running around and trying to take the soups, the <span class="spatial object">kettles</span>, so we had to with sticks and stand guard, to escort the people who brought the soup, because they would just eat them and run with them. </sentence><sentence id="1705">We needed them for the patients. </sentence><sentence id="1706">The <span class="populated place">camp</span> was getting bigger and bigger, and one day they said they were going to move all of our patients, and the whole <span class="populated place">camp</span> first, on the other side of main <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1707">This was originally a <span class="populated place">prisoner of war camp</span>, and they had some permanent <span class="building">buildings</span> which were <span class="building">hospital buildings</span>, and they moved first the <span class="populated place">camp</span> and then they moved the <span class="building">hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1708">Our group was assigned to main <span class="building">building</span> number one. </sentence><sentence id="1709">It had an <span class="interior space">operating room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1710">It had a <span class="building">dental office</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1711">It had some <span class="dlf">wards</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1712">We had like an <span class="interior space">outpatient room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1713">So, the first order of business was that the <span class="interior space">operating room</span> had white tile floors and <span class="dlf">walls</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1714">So, the first thing they did, they removed all the tiles, the ceramic tiles, because the commandant wanted that for his <span class="interior space">bathroom</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1715">I believe we had electricity. </sentence><sentence id="1716">I can't even remember. </sentence><sentence id="1717">They must have had electricity because my mother had this <span class="spatial object">sterilizer</span> that was an electric sterilizer or she had spirit or something to sterilize the <span class="spatial object">instruments</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1718">The <span class="building">dental office</span> was so beautifully equipped that when the <span class="building">Red Cross</span> would come in an examine the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, that's where they would take them, because there was all the equipment you wanted to have. </sentence><sentence id="1719">No x-rays, but everything else. </sentence><sentence id="1720">There was enough novocain that we were afraid if we used up the novocain, the war would never end. </sentence><sentence id="1721">Then there must have been a <span class="interior space">room</span> for the nurses, and then there was <span class="interior space">room</span> where the doctors lived and Mom took me with her and I shared a <span class="spatial object">bed</span> with her because they wouldn't give me a <span class="spatial object">bed</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1722">I was a nurse and they wouldn't give me a <span class="spatial object">bed</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1743">Q: So, all along you were living in the <span class="building">hospital</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1745">A: Right, right. </sentence><sentence id="1746">And that <span class="interior space">room</span> was Doctor Annie and a couple of other doctors, Lisa was the administrator, Theresa who was the scribe, then they sent in another dentist, the Russian dentist, Larissa. </sentence><sentence id="1747">One day, the commandant children governor who was a Seventh Day Adventist, was German, they were arrested. </sentence><sentence id="1748">She came down with typhus. </sentence><sentence id="1749">This was much later, so she was put in with the doctors in that <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1750">That was his orders that she should be kept in that <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1751">We had one <span class="interior space">surgical ward</span> where people had all kinds of wounds, surgical wounds. </sentence><sentence id="1752">Sometimes we had to cut something, and we were getting very little supplies, and I took it upon myself -- because I was working always with Doctor Annie in the <span class="building">outpatient clinic</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1753">I very seldom worked the <span class="dlf">wards</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1754">I did very well with the outpatients in whatever had to be done. </sentence><sentence id="1755">Whenever we got supplies I used to go in to change the dressings and you almost needed a gas mask for it. </sentence><sentence id="1756">This was stinky, festering thing and we didn't have enough bandages. </sentence><sentence id="1757">We didn't get them enough. </sentence><sentence id="1758">We couldn't change them every day. </sentence><sentence id="1759">Maybe once a week, once in ten days they would bring us the supplies and there was some peroxide and maybe some ointment, maybe some powder to dust on the wounds, and I used to get so many blessings when I used to change the dressings. </sentence><sentence id="1760">This  7 was the main <span class="building">hospital building</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1761">The next one was the nicest <span class="building">building</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1762">That's where the children were. </sentence><sentence id="1763">By that time, they took away or send them out or whatever happened to the parents of the Dutch and Belgium children, so they formed an <span class="building">orphanage</span> there, and the Slovak women lived there with their children, and then the few mothers as long as the babies were alive, they lived there. </sentence><sentence id="1764">That's were Doctor lived. </sentence><sentence id="1765">That place  8 to handle those bodies, and the deeper they were going, the more decomposed those bodies were. </sentence><sentence id="1766">Believe me, at the end of the day, they looked as raggedy as most of the prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="1767">This was horrid. </sentence><sentence id="1768">Anyway, the <span class="populated place">camp</span> was getting bigger. </sentence><sentence id="1769">There were <span class="spatial object">transports</span> coming in every few days, and they needed help with the <span class="spatial object">transports</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1770">When the <span class="spatial object">transports</span> came in, the able bodies would get a <span class="interior space">shower</span> and they would place them in <span class="populated place">camp</span>, but there were some sick people coming in and they were checking who was sick and who is not, so they would need a doctor to ascertain whether the person could be saved. </sentence><sentence id="1771">A few were nurses, and I felt so badly, the girls were going out every night one I said, "I'm going. </sentence><sentence id="1772">I have to help them. </sentence><sentence id="1773">I just can't let them work both nights." </sentence><sentence id="1774">So, we went out. </sentence><sentence id="1775">By the time we got there, most of the able bodies they were processed. </sentence><sentence id="1776">There was this big <span class="interior space">room</span> with all kinds of <span class="spatial object">bundles</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1777">They made the people leave the <span class="spatial object">bundles</span> and there were sick people. </sentence><sentence id="1778">Some of them were lame, but we managed to undress them and put their clothes in those little fish net bags and once they went through the thing, the steam would kill the vermin, and they could go on the other side and find their own clothes. </sentence><sentence id="1779">There was one woman who was in a coma, and the Germans kept saying, "Throwing her out. </sentence><sentence id="1780">She's half dead, she's dead." </sentence><sentence id="1781">I kept on shoving her around that place behind some things because I felt by the time I finished, maybe she'll revive. </sentence><sentence id="1782">Whether she was in a diabetic coma, what, a fairly young woman well dressed, and every time they saw me, they said "Come on take her out. </sentence><sentence id="1783">Let's take her out. </sentence><sentence id="1784">Let the guys take her out." </sentence><sentence id="1785">So, I was hiding her behind <span class="spatial object">bundles</span>, behind anything. </sentence><sentence id="1786">Unfortunately the end of the evening we couldn't do anything but slap her face. </sentence><sentence id="1787">I tried to give her some <span class="env feature">water</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1788">Whatever we tried to do it couldn't revive her, so they took her out. </sentence><sentence id="1789">That <span class="spatial object">transport</span> was so full of lice. </sentence><sentence id="1790">We got so bitten by lice. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1837">Q: Where were most of these <span class="spatial object">transports</span> from? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1839">A: They were from <span class="country">Hungary</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1840">I think <span class="country">Poland</span> by that time was clean. </sentence><sentence id="1841">They finished with those. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1845">Q: They weren't necessarily coming from <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1847">A: No, no those people were coming with their own clothes and whatever the <span class="populated place">camp</span> wore. </sentence><sentence id="1848">They were not from <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1849">They were not from <span class="populated place">camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1850">They were wherever they lived in. </sentence><sentence id="1851">Anyway, then it was getting almost light and they said all right we're finished with you. </sentence><sentence id="1852">We can take you back to the <span class="building">barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1853">And we said, "You know, you bathed everybody, you deloused them, and here we are crawling with insects. </sentence><sentence id="1854">We are bitten all over the place and why don't you let us have a <span class="interior space">shower</span> and delouse us, our clothes, otherwise we'll bring the whole stuff back to <span class="populated place">camp</span>." </sentence><sentence id="1855">They said that's a good idea and they even stoked the fires and we had a nice warm <span class="interior space">shower</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1865">Q: How often did you <span class="spatial object">shower</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1867">A: We never showered. </sentence><sentence id="1868">The first time when they brought you to <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1869">This was the second one. </sentence><sentence id="1870">Maybe once they took us out. </sentence><sentence id="1871">I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="1872"> 9 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1879">Q: So, you never washed? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1881">A: Well, we washed. </sentence><sentence id="1882">Maybe once they took us to <span class="spatial object">shower</span>, maybe when we're changing <span class="populated place">camps</span>, I think they marched us. </sentence><sentence id="1883">This was a pleasure, this <span class="interior space">shower</span>, and they took our clothes and they deloused them. </sentence><sentence id="1884">Three weeks later I came with the typhus fever. </sentence><sentence id="1885">I came back and I said boy I was bitten and this one doctor was with me and three weeks later, as I said, to the day, I came down with it. </sentence><sentence id="1886">At first they didn't know what was wrong with me. </sentence><sentence id="1887">So, by this time we didn't have Schnabble. </sentence><sentence id="1888">We had a young doctor who was wounded at the <span class="region">Russian front</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1889">His arm was injured and he was working in <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1890">They heard that I might have typhus fever, so he and the dentist came to examine me, because they have never seen typhus before, and they figure out that I have it. </sentence><sentence id="1891">By that time, the doctors in the <span class="interior space">room</span> that I slept with they decided they don't want anyone with the typhus fever, so they kicked me out on the <span class="interior space">ward</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1892">But I had my own <span class="spatial object">bed</span>, and I was lying next to a girl who used to be a patient of mine. </sentence><sentence id="1893">She had t.b. </sentence><sentence id="1894">but I tried to keep her on calcium. </sentence><sentence id="1895">The theory was that calcium was good for t.b. </sentence><sentence id="1896">and we had calcium, she would get it. </sentence><sentence id="1897">Again, she was a young woman. </sentence><sentence id="1898">You tried to help people who were not too far gone. </sentence><sentence id="1899">We felt if we could help them, keep them going for a while, maybe they can keep on going. </sentence><sentence id="1900">By that time, the epidemic started. </sentence><sentence id="1901">The typhus epidemic. </sentence><sentence id="1902">It was by the end of the war, this must have been February or March and by the end 90 percent of the people had typhus. </sentence><sentence id="1903">My fever was building up about three weeks. </sentence><sentence id="1904">It's like with pneumonia. </sentence><sentence id="1905">It build up, if the patient can survive the crisis. </sentence><sentence id="1906">Well, Mom would warm up water in the <span class="spatial object">sterilizer</span> and wash me and bring water and wet my lips. </sentence><sentence id="1907">And those Slovak ladies made me a little <span class="spatial object">pillow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1908">I'll never forget it. </sentence><sentence id="1909">This tiny little <span class="spatial object">pillow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1910">They collected some feathers because they thought I was so nice to them, and they brought me this. </sentence><sentence id="1911">And I kept on saying "Get the <span class="spatial object">train</span> out of my head, get the <span class="spatial object">train</span> out of my head. </sentence><sentence id="1912">I can't stand the <span class="spatial object">train</span>." </sentence><sentence id="1913">And when they would bring the turnip soup into the <span class="interior space">room</span>, it was wretched. </sentence><sentence id="1914">I couldn't stand it. </sentence><sentence id="1915">Finally one night, I must have reached the crisis, and called this woman next <span class="dlf">door</span> and said "Get me my mother." </sentence><sentence id="1916">So they woke up the night nurses, got my mother and she came running in and there was a doctor and again we had some supplies. </sentence><sentence id="1917">We had something to support the <span class="spatial object">heart</span>, just a <span class="spatial object">stimulator heart</span>, and they gave me a shot of it, because I felt I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1918">I think I was dying. </sentence><sentence id="1919">Then I got better. </sentence><sentence id="1920">In the interim, I just want to bring out the difference between two doctors. </sentence><sentence id="1921">I haven't seen those surgeries because I was so sick. </sentence><sentence id="1922">This young German doctor performed some surgeries. </sentence><sentence id="1923">Again, he wanted to learn. </sentence><sentence id="1924">He did them in the <span class="interior space">operating room</span> under sterile conditions and he always had this Greek doctor with him. </sentence><sentence id="1925">Sometimes he would I mean people told me about it. </sentence><sentence id="1926">Sometimes he would hesitate what to do and he would look at the Greek doctor and the Greek doctor would say, "Well, don't you think you should do this," but very diplomatically, and he never offered advice until the guy looked at him. </sentence><sentence id="1927">He didn't know where he was going. </sentence><sentence id="1928">So, they did perform some surgeries on those people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1977">Q: So there was actually a somewhat serious effort to cure people? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1979">A: I don't know if it was serious to cure people of if this was a way for him to learn. </sentence><sentence id="1980">I mean  0 they never had the chance to -- if he is a very known professor and he is a young doctor and maybe he should learn. </sentence><sentence id="1981">And he and his pal, the dentist, used to sit in the <span class="building">dental office</span> most of the day. </sentence><sentence id="1982">He also had some massages done. </sentence><sentence id="1983">First one masseuse and then the other friend of mine, the one who was the head of that very <span class="interior space">sick ward</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1984">She would come in because he needed physical therapy on his arm. </sentence><sentence id="1985">The first time we had the inkling that things were going bad for Germans they were discussing it very quietly. </sentence><sentence id="1986">The Russians are so and so many kilometers from <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> and they were afraid of Russians. </sentence><sentence id="1987">My mother overheard a conversation. </sentence><sentence id="1988">Whether that was done to let us know, or they just forgot about her working because she ignored them, that's when we knew things were happening. </sentence><sentence id="1989">By the time, close to the liberation, there was cholera there. </sentence><sentence id="1990">There was a raging epidemic of typhus. </sentence><sentence id="1991">There was all kinds of sickness and less supplies and less food. </sentence><sentence id="1992">One day this other doctor, I think it was called up over lined us up -- we didn't have  1 </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2019">Q: So, then a lot of the <span class="populated place">subcamps</span> got combined? </sentence></p></dialogue>

</sentence><sentence id="2164">The girls were screaming and yelling and hollering and they wanted to pull on the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="2165">I went once to see it, but I just couldn't do it. </sentence><sentence id="2166">I also went out, I think one day after they liberated us and I went out -- the <span class="dlf">gates</span> between the <span class="dlf">compounds</span> were
