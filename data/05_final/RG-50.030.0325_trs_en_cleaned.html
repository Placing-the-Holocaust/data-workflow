<body><dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1">FRITZ SCHNAITTACHER May 9, 1995 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2">A: My name is Fritz Schnaittacher. </sentence><sentence id="3">I was born in a small <span class="populated place">village</span> near <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4">The name of the <span class="populated place">village</span> was Forth, F-O-R-T-H. It's a <span class="populated place">village</span> that's about 23 kilometers from <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span>, about ten kilometers from <span class="populated place">Schnaittach</span>, after which we are named, and it had a population of 1,100. </sentence><sentence id="5">At the time I was born it might have had ten or fifteen Jewish families. </sentence><sentence id="6">By the time I left, it had dwindled to eight. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="12">Q: I need some dates here. </sentence><sentence id="13">What year were you born? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="16">A: I was born in July of 1913 and left -- an interesting part of the development of young Jews at that particular time was that the <span class="populated place">village</span> only provided elementary education. </sentence><sentence id="17">During the first three years of my life, I was in a one room <span class="building">school house</span> which was staffed by a teacher who was Jewish who acted also as a cantor and an insurance agent on the side. </sentence><sentence id="18">Finally, the small <span class="populated place">community</span> could no longer afford this teacher, and we were transferred at the third year of <span class="building">elementary school</span> to the <span class="building">government school</span>, which was largely a <span class="building">Protestant school</span>, because the <span class="populated place">village</span> also had a <span class="building">Catholic school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="19">I lived in this <span class="populated place">village</span> of <span class="populated place">Forth</span> until it became necessary for the purpose of getting a better education to go to a so called <span class="building">Pensionat</span>, a glorified <span class="building">boarding house</span> in <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="20">My mother, who then had been a war widow, had to give me up just like she gave up her elder son, my brother Mike, who also went to this <span class="building">Pensionat</span> in order to go from there to a <span class="building">Realschule</span>, or in my case, ultimately to a <span class="building">commercial high school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="21">It is interesting to note that because of coming from a <span class="populated place">village</span> <span class="building">elementary school</span>, I had to undergo an entrance examination into the then what we considered preferable the <span class="building">Realschule</span>, a <span class="building">high school</span> providing education in languages, math, etc. </sentence><sentence id="22">But anti-semitism back in 1923 in that particular <span class="building">school</span> had risen to the extent where the director of the <span class="building">boarding house</span> saw fit to transfer me from there to the <span class="building">commercial high school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="23">Life continued as a student and the practice was to go <span class="building">home</span> on vacation and holidays and of course that was a double holiday to be spent with my mother and spinster aunts who housed the family. </sentence><sentence id="24">After graduation, at the age of 17, I went to work in a <span class="building">wholesale establishment</span> for the sale of household goods and toys. </sentence><sentence id="25">This would have brought us up to the year 1930. </sentence><sentence id="26">In these intervening years, Nazism grew, but it did attain the imminent danger of the overthrow of the <span class="country">Weimar Republic</span>. </sentence><sentence id="27">The years 1932 indeed seemed to from my memory and as a youngster, seemed to reflect a decrease in the significance of the Nazi party. </sentence><sentence id="28">There was an election in <span class="populated place">Schleswig-Holstein</span> which indicated for the first time a decrease in the electoral votes that the Nazis got. </sentence><sentence id="29">This presented the urgency to <span class="populated place">Hindenberg</span> to appoint Hitler Chancellor on January 30, 1933. </sentence><sentence id="30">That changed the situation radically. </sentence><sentence id="31">Immediately after the appointment of Hitler as Chancellor, forms of oppression of terror began to ensue not as yet outwardly against the Jews, but most of all against social democrats and communists, anti- fascist forces. </sentence><sentence id="32">In order to give the appointment of Hitler's Chancellor the democratic appearance, the election of March 6, 1933 was called. </sentence><sentence id="33">The disunity on the left and the support of the Nazi movement by German nationalists brought about the so-called electoral  victory confirming Hitler in the position of Chancellor. </sentence><sentence id="34">Thereafter, really, the efforts began to denude <span class="country">Germany</span> of human rights, of civil rights, of democratic rights. </sentence><sentence id="35">Now, shall I swing over the time of the arrest? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="56">Q: Not yet. </sentence><sentence id="57">What I would like to ask you is prior to this period of time, did you have any trouble with people as a Jew? </sentence><sentence id="58">Did you come from a religious family? </sentence><sentence id="59">Did you mix well with your German neighbors? </sentence><sentence id="60">What was it like before Hitler? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="66">A: What was social life in a <span class="populated place">community</span> such as the little <span class="populated place">village</span> or for that matter social life in the <span class="populated place">city</span> of <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="67">Now, I can speak of it from only a very limited point of view. </sentence><sentence id="68">As far as the <span class="populated place">village</span> was concerned, after we had left <span class="building">school</span> we hardly -- we only would socialize and to a very limited scale with young people whom we knew to be anti-Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="69">The few -- I shouldn't say few, there were quite a few social democrats and those were the only people that we socialized with. </sentence><sentence id="70">Earlier on, during the years that I went to <span class="building">school</span> in <span class="populated place">Forth</span>, we would play soccer yet with everyone. </sentence><sentence id="71">That was until say 1930. </sentence><sentence id="72">From then on, the <span class="dlf">lines</span> were beginning to be drawn much more severely. </sentence><sentence id="73">Now, the question could be raised why would it be called for that a young man who is working in <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span> and during the week lives in <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span> would go <span class="building">home</span> over weekends. </sentence><sentence id="74">Well, obviously one was drawn first of all by the family and one didn't have the opportunity to one as a Jew to form broad social friendships. </sentence><sentence id="75">It was very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="76">My family was not a orthodox Jewish family. </sentence><sentence id="77">It practiced traditional Judaism. </sentence><sentence id="78">| at one time through my growing up period had developed a spirit of orthodoxy in deed until I became some sixteen, seventeen years old and I lost it. </sentence><sentence id="79">| became agnostic. </sentence><sentence id="80">Our social life in <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span> centered around a German Jewish Youth movement which believed in ideas of humanity and yet we were able to enjoy life, until truly the radical changes took place in the beginning of 1933. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="96">Q: Did you experience any abuse or attacks verbal or otherwise? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="98">A: 1 in the place of <span class="building">business</span> where I worked, I never experienced any acts of anti-semitism. </sentence><sentence id="99">The <span class="building">place of business</span> was owned by two Jewish families. </sentence><sentence id="100">As a matter of fact, particularly one non-Jewish family I was very friendly with. </sentence><sentence id="101">I considered him to be a devout anti-Nazi. </sentence><sentence id="102">On the <span class="dlf">street</span> I wouldn't be recognized as a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="103">I'm not proud of that, so I did not experience any acts of anti-semitism only when I would become involved in <span class="dlf">street</span> discussions and they were not infrequent. </sentence><sentence id="104">Then <span class="region">sides</span> were being drawn occasionally with violence. </sentence><sentence id="105">Once, I do remember one little incident which happened in the <span class="dlf">moat</span> of <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="106"><span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span>, the <span class="populated place">medieval city</span> is surrounded by <span class="dlf">moat</span> which was used in those days to play soccer in. </sentence><sentence id="107">The kids from the <span class="building">boarding house</span>, some ten or 13 or us went to the <span class="dlf">moat</span> in order to play soccer when all of a sudden a bunch of rowdies, Nazis, came storming upon us trying to beat us up and I'll never forget one single guy with a hammer and cycle on his cap, I must mention it, a hammer and cycle on his cap he beat them off. </sentence><sentence id="108">These things stand out in one'e memory. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="109">Q: When you talk about all of the <span class="dlf">street</span> discussions, what was the mood? </sentence><sentence id="110">What was going on? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="111">A: The <span class="dlf">street</span> discussions were between right and left. </sentence><sentence id="112">The <span class="dlf">street</span> discussions were prior to the appointment of Hitler as a Chancellor. </sentence><sentence id="113">Thereafter there were no more <span class="dlf">street</span> discussions. </sentence><sentence id="114">They were in anticipation of the elections. </sentence><sentence id="115">There were several elections in <span class="country">Germany</span> during the year of 1932. </sentence><sentence id="116">I did, now that I research my mind, I did experience another rather painful experience in our <span class="populated place">village</span> -- it used to be a <span class="building">vacation home</span> for Jewish children, and I was befriended by one of the young social workers in charge of this <span class="building">home</span>, and there were maybe 30, 40 children, and they had taken a walk to a neighboring <span class="populated place">village</span> and I followed them when all of a sudden I was being attacked by a guy from my <span class="populated place">village</span> who was known as a criminal who was on the loose. </sentence><sentence id="117">I didn't want to become entangled with him. </sentence><sentence id="118">Finally I had to ask for police protection and we got <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="119">The police visited us. </sentence><sentence id="120">That was in the summer of 1932. </sentence><sentence id="121">In order to ask whether we wanted to press charges and we decided not to. </sentence><sentence id="122">It was a rather potentially dangerous act. </sentence><sentence id="123">There were other occasions when Nazis pelted our <span class="building">house</span> with stones, but then in the year 1932 one wasn't hesitant to go after them, but that again that ceased after January 1933. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="137">Q: Were you at all friendly with Christian neighbors? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="139">A: We had neighbors in a broad sense, yes. </sentence><sentence id="140">We had some friends in the <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="141">Our family had lived in the <span class="populated place">village</span> for many generations. </sentence><sentence id="142">I think you're going back possibly to the early part of the 18th centuries. </sentence><sentence id="143">Jews only received citizen names in the year 1729 and over the years because we were the family that tried to do well by the poor people, so we had many friends amongst them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="149">Q: While we're on this, can you tell us a little bit about your family. </sentence><sentence id="150">I know that you said your mother was widowed and you lived with her. </sentence><sentence id="151">What about the rest of your family? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="155">A: Well, my father died as a result of World War I, in 1919. </sentence><sentence id="156">When he was only 47 years old. </sentence><sentence id="157">He had not suffered bodily injury, but the service had caused had aggravated his heart condition and he died of a heart attack in 1919 when I was 6 years old and my mother was 31. </sentence><sentence id="158">My father had two spinster sisters and two or three single brothers no four single brothers who all were living in the two <span class="building">houses</span> that we owned visa vie from each other. </sentence><sentence id="159">He had also a married sister living a few <span class="building">houses</span> away in the <span class="populated place">village</span> and after my father had died if it is of some interest we were --- the family had been in the <span class="building">textile business</span>. </sentence><sentence id="160">Part of the <span class="building">house</span> was devoted to a <span class="building">store</span> where we sold piece goods but the men of the <span class="building">house</span> pursued the hop business. </sentence><sentence id="161">This was the <span class="region">hop- growing section</span> and we went around, my father and my uncles went around to the <span class="populated place">farming villages</span> to buy the hops, and we sulfurized them, baled them and took them to the largest <span class="building">hop market</span> in the world which was <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span> by horse and <span class="spatial object">freight car</span>. </sentence><sentence id="162">There were no <span class="spatial object">automobiles</span> in the <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="163">In deed, my mother got the first <span class="spatial object">car</span> I think in 1923 or 24. </sentence><sentence id="164">This describes somewhat the cultural life and existence of Jews in the <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="165">Q: Did you have brothers and sisters? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="166">A: I had one brother who passed away 23 years ago. </sentence><sentence id="167">Interesting is the fact that my mother, this very courageous woman, took over this <span class="building">textile business</span> and during the years that she didn't have a <span class="spatial object">car</span>, drove out by horse and <span class="spatial object">buggy</span> to the <span class="populated place">farming village</span> in order to sell from <span class="building">house</span> to <span class="building">house</span> the piece goods and invite the farmers from the <span class="populated place">village</span> to the <span class="building">store</span> in order to buy. </sentence><sentence id="168">She was an amazing vital and courageous woman. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="172">Q: Your brother was he an older brother? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="174">A: My brother was four years older than I am, but he died at a very young age. </sentence><sentence id="175">He had left for <span class="country">America</span> four years prior than myself, not because of Nazi persecution at that time, but because an uncle of ours had come over in 1900 and had no children of his own, no family of his own, decided to have him join him to ultimately take over his <span class="building">business</span>. </sentence><sentence id="176">It was this uncle who then four years later was helping me to come out of <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="180">Q: One other question about this period you had mentioned a Youth movement that you were involved in. </sentence><sentence id="181">Was this political at all or Zionist? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="184">A: No, it was not Zionist. </sentence><sentence id="185">To be sure we were conscious Jews but rainbow colors of political opinions, largely however forward looking, progressive. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="188">Q: Is there anything else you want to tell me about your boyhood in either <span class="populated place">Forth</span> or <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span> or the mood of the times? </sentence><sentence id="189">Anything else you can remember? </sentence><sentence id="190">It sounds like you had a fairly comfortable existence? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="194">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="195">My family lived in very comfortable circumstances. </sentence><sentence id="196">We weren't rich, but to be sure we were conscious of the very difficult conditions which existed in <span class="country">Germany</span> economically where you could paper your <span class="dlf">walls</span> with the money that was printed yesterday. </sentence><sentence id="197">The inflation didn't go unscathed by us and there was rationing of food and it is one of the few recollections that I have of being with my father after he had gotten back from the war and we were riding out in horse and <span class="spatial object">buggy</span> and opened <span class="spatial object">freight car</span> like in order to go toa neighboring <span class="populated place">village</span> and buy from the farmer four geese. </sentence><sentence id="198">That was considered like <span class="building">black market</span>. </sentence><sentence id="199">I know it, did my father know it? </sentence><sentence id="200">Probably. </sentence><sentence id="201">So, the farmer loaded the geese on the <span class="spatial object">cart</span> and covered them with straw, but it wasn't a half an hour later that we heard the shrill whistle of a policeman on a <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> who could move faster than we did by <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span>, not <span class="spatial object">motorcycle</span>. </sentence><sentence id="202">As he drew abreast of us, he forced us to turn around and return the geese to the farmer. </sentence><sentence id="203">It was however, a week or two weeks later when the farmer drove up to our <span class="building">house</span> and delivered the geese. </sentence><sentence id="204">Somehow he had escaped the attention of the authorities then, but  yes, there was hunger in the <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="205">There was the large scale unemployment which led to the radicalization of the political life. </sentence><sentence id="206">Were the farmers friendly with us? </sentence><sentence id="207">Yes, in the main they were very friendly with us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="222">Q: You said that in 1933, everything started changing very quickly; like what? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="224">A: The changes in 1933 that I indicated which came about were demonstrated immediately after the appointment of Hitler as Chancellor on January 30. </sentence><sentence id="225">The very following day there were demonstrations of stormtroopers along the <span class="dlf">street</span> where I worked and the call went out close your <span class="dlf">windows</span> or we shall shoot. </sentence><sentence id="226">On the same <span class="dlf">street</span> there had been the editorial and <span class="building">printing offices</span> of the <span class="building">social democratic newspaper</span> which had been destroyed on this occasion. </sentence><sentence id="227">On top of that <span class="building">building</span> on the <span class="interior space">fifth floor</span> or <span class="interior space">fourth floor</span> were the offices of people that the company that we had been doing business with. </sentence><sentence id="228">I forgot the name. </sentence><sentence id="229">They were wholesalers in textiles, and I took it upon myself to ask the stormtroopers who had been guarding the Social Democratic newspaper in order to visit the <span class="building">offices</span> of this particular <span class="building">company</span> which was owned by Jewish people, and I was greeted with a deep feeling of dismay and despair because their goods were stolen. </sentence><sentence id="230">Their goods were thrown out of the <span class="dlf">window</span> to stormtroopers who were waiting <span class="interior space">downstairs</span>. </sentence><sentence id="231">That was the beginning, only the very beginning of it and you could during the time of the announcement of elections to be held on March 6, 1933, during these short five weeks election rallies of the opposition were prohibited. </sentence><sentence id="232">So, it really began rapidly to spread fear and hopelessness in the circles of the anti-Nazi movement. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="242">Q: What were you afraid of? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="244">A: I was afraid of physical persecution, of being beaten up and the beatings that they rendered were severe. </sentence><sentence id="245">After the --if you were accused of anti-Nazi activities you were likely to be sent to <span class="building">prison</span> and after all that didn't take long. </sentence><sentence id="246">On March the 26th, twenty days after the election, when I came <span class="building">home</span> on my weekly weekend visit to my mother, I was settled down and we would have a cup of coffee. </sentence><sentence id="247">My mother had a bad cold, but we were happy to see each other. </sentence><sentence id="248">That happiness lasted but a few minutes, and there was a hard knock on the <span class="dlf">door</span> of our <span class="interior space">living room</span> and there was the gendarme, who said, "Herr Schnaittacher, come with me to the <span class="building">police station</span>." </sentence><sentence id="249">I asked why to no avail; no answer. </sentence><sentence id="250">I had no alternative but to follow him. </sentence><sentence id="251">That was in what would have been the purpose of saying no I'm not going with you not without an arrest warrant. </sentence><sentence id="252">This is authority. </sentence><sentence id="253">I followed him to the <span class="building">police station</span>, and as we arrived at the <span class="building">police station</span> he said, "Herr Schnaittacher, you're under arrest." </sentence><sentence id="254">I said, "Why?" </sentence><sentence id="255">No answer. </sentence><sentence id="256">I said can I go <span class="building">home</span> to say goodbye to my mother. </sentence><sentence id="257">He said no. </sentence><sentence id="258">I said can I call my mother? </sentence><sentence id="259">He said here use the <span class="spatial object">telephone</span>. </sentence><sentence id="260">It was probably one of the most difficult and painful telephone calls I've had to make in my life. " </sentence><sentence id="261">Mother, I'm under arrest." </sentence><sentence id="262">You could have heard her shriek to the <span class="building">police station</span>. </sentence><sentence id="263">We lived quite a distance from it. </sentence><sentence id="264">She came storming out, protesting, but all to no avail. </sentence><sentence id="265">An hour later, after the policeman asked me whether I carried weapons on me, and I had a little knife and he said you better give it to me  so it couldn't be used as evidence. </sentence><sentence id="266">After an hour I was transported by <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="267">The <span class="populated place">village</span> didn't have a regular <span class="building">prison</span>, and I was transported to the <span class="populated place">county seat</span> of <span class="populated place">Erlangen</span>, a <span class="populated place">university city</span> and a <span class="populated place">county seat</span>, and I was delivered to the <span class="building">prison</span>. </sentence><sentence id="268">The warden received me, assigned me to a <span class="interior space">cell</span> and dusk began to settle and the <span class="dlf">cell door</span> opened and I was put in to a <span class="interior space">cell</span> that consisted of a wooden board that we slept on, a <span class="spatial object">bucket</span>, and you can imagine what it was for, and three pitchers of water and <span class="spatial object">water basins</span> for drinking and washing. </sentence><sentence id="269">It was inhabited by two other men, one a communist, one a socialists. </sentence><sentence id="270">All of them were at least double my age. </sentence><sentence id="271">I wasn't twenty, yet. </sentence><sentence id="272">And, so here I was. </sentence><sentence id="273">It wasn't a incarceration that could be in the terms that we subsequently learned inhuman, it was deadening. </sentence><sentence id="274">There was very simple sometimes inedible food. </sentence><sentence id="275">The living conditions were very primitive. </sentence><sentence id="276">We then were assigned <span class="spatial object">mattresses</span> and a blanket. </sentence><sentence id="277">It wasn't without humor and I might relate these two little stories. </sentence><sentence id="278">The first morning and I didn't need sleeping pills then, which I do now, the first morning my cellmates very humanly gave me the easiest job and that was to fill the <span class="spatial object">water buckets</span>. </sentence><sentence id="279">There was one <span class="spatial object">faucet</span> with running water in the long <span class="interior space">hallway</span> that opened up to the <span class="interior space">cells</span>. </sentence><sentence id="280">And as a I stood there filling the <span class="spatial object">pitchers</span> with water and I turned around and who was sitting in the adjoining <span class="interior space">cell</span> but my second cousin from the <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="281">So what they had done was they had the humanity of only arresting the two young male Jews instead of all the others. </sentence><sentence id="282">The other little story is headed under humor. </sentence><sentence id="283">A few days after we had been brought in we saw on our daily walk in the <span class="interior space">courtyard</span> of the <span class="building">prison</span> which was important because we had no exercise otherwise, there was a young kid, even younger than I was who told us the story that he had been picked up in a certain <span class="populated place">village</span> as a vagrant, for vagrancy, and one day as he came down he clapped his hands out of pure joy. </sentence><sentence id="284">Why? </sentence><sentence id="285">Because he saw the mayor of the <span class="populated place">village</span> who had arrested him now also in <span class="building">prison</span>. </sentence><sentence id="286">This is in <span class="country">Germany</span> Schadenfreude, what is best English translation, "spiteful joy." </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="330">Q: Did they ever tell you why you were arrested? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="332">A: Okay, the charges for my arrested and I insisted and finally they were given to me. </sentence><sentence id="333">I was accused of agitation against the National Socialist Government, knowledge of secret <span class="dlf">ammunition dumps</span>, and liaison man of secret anti-Nazi organizations. </sentence><sentence id="334">I remotely could have been accused of agitation against the National Socialist Government well it was perfectly legal. </sentence><sentence id="335">Thereafter I desisted of any political activity. </sentence><sentence id="336">I had been an anti-fascist throughout. </sentence><sentence id="337">My conscience dictated it to me. </sentence><sentence id="338">From the moment that I had been arrested, my mother did not rest for a moment, until she succeeded in setting us free. </sentence><sentence id="339">That came about through her contact with the Sturmbahnfihrer and the higher officer of the S.A. who three weeks

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="673">A: Well, as far as my rank was concerned, when you become a commissioned officer it's called great. </sentence><sentence id="674">I was a Second Lieutenant at the time that I joined the 157th Infantry Regiment of the 45th National Guard Division of <span class="region">Oklahoma</span>. </sentence><sentence id="675">The <span class="building">45th Division</span> was the <span class="building">Oklahoma National Guard Division</span>, one of the most battle tested outfits in the war. </sentence><sentence id="676">It had a 400 percent, if that is claim to fame 400 percent casualty turnover. </sentence><sentence id="677">It was one of three <span class="region">divisions</span> that was used in the attack. </sentence><sentence id="678">The 36th and the 3rd and the 45th. </sentence><sentence id="679">A <span class="building">division</span> consisted at that time of roughly 20,000 men consisting of three regiments each regiment had three battalion and each battalion had four companies. </sentence><sentence id="680">Whether that is different now, I do not know. </sentence><sentence id="681">Our specific purposes, and I say our, the I.P.W. specific purpose was to receive prisoners as early as possible out of the chaos of battle in order to get the truth of whatever information they were able to give and it was up to us to discern and as we began to accumulate information from the many, many prisoners that we were able to learn truth from fiction because we knew a lot of the information that they had had and could balance it off and very few because of the tactics we had learned would refuse to provide us with the information we were seeking. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="691">Q: How did you do that? </sentence><sentence id="692">What kind of tactics? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="695">A: Rule number one--and you're testing my memory--rule number one was never to ask a question that you could answer with yes or no. </sentence><sentence id="696">Revealing information that we have had and formulating a question accordingly. </sentence><sentence id="697">Speaking to them in the dialect that they were accustomed to because we had sensitive ears and we knew the dialects all over <span class="country">Germany</span> and if we were able to speak we were able to locate them and thereby develop a relationship that created a degree of confidence and willingness to give. </sentence><sentence id="698">The morale of the German Army began to be sure once we entered German proper, began to deteriorate rapidly. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="703">Q: One other question and then I want you tell me where you went. </sentence><sentence id="704">Did you go over there with any trepidation or great eagerness to take this assignment on. </sentence><sentence id="705">Do you remember what you were feeling at the time when you were just not another American soldier. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="709">A: I to the best of my recollection I went with a degree of eagerness because it was one way that I truly could contribute to the effort of destroying Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="710">To be sure I needed to learn. </sentence><sentence id="711">I never forget a first attempt, my first attempt to interrogate prisoners and then to report the results of my interrogation to the general in charge of our regiment, who had been accustomed to the battle wise master sergeant, who had furnished him information through many campaigns, from <span class="country">Africa</span> or <span class="region">Sicily</span> up to , and here he now turns to the brand new chickenshit second lieutenant, he says well Lieutenant what did you learn? </sentence><sentence id="712">I told him fanciful stories that there of enormous strategic importance and with dismay he turned away from me and says my buddy's name master sergeant was Fritz, he says, "Fritz, what do you know?" </sentence><sentence id="713">But it changed rapidly and with due modesty I became an expert. </sentence><sentence id="714">Yet, the most  4 successful interrogation that I had was when I couldn't ask questions. </sentence><sentence id="715">On March 15, 1945, we had a company of ours had broken through the <span class="dlf">Siegfried Line</span> into one of the deep enormously strong <span class="dlf">fortifications</span>. </sentence><sentence id="716">My regimental intelligence officer came to me and said, "Lieutenant, this is beyond the call of duty, but if you care to, and Fritz we would like you to go up and the company has occupied the <span class="interior space">bunker</span> and they hear voices on the telephone system but they can't make them out." </sentence><sentence id="717">So, we did and it was a very active night. </sentence><sentence id="718">There was a lot of firing going on, but we made it. </sentence><sentence id="719">The moment I picked up the received and then relayed the information to my buddy, one sergeant from a German outfit who identified himself and his outfit reported to an officer of another outfit identifying the outfit indicating the <span class="dlf">route</span> of withdrawal, the next day's <span class="building">ammunition dump</span>, the location of the <span class="building">ammunition dump</span>, the <span class="building">refueling dump</span>, any question that I could have possibly asked that was of material tactical information was revealed and the following day we were able, not only because of our information but other information that came in to slice totally through the <span class="dlf">Siegfried Line</span> and advance by some 30 miles. </sentence><sentence id="720">That was a proud day. </sentence><sentence id="721">From then on, we moved very rapidly and we moved along a <span class="dlf">line</span> that could hardly have been designed any better had I volunteered or had I been asked because of my personal knowledge of <span class="region">areas</span>. </sentence><sentence id="722">The first such <span class="populated place">town</span> that we occupied that we conquered, was <span class="populated place">Aschaffenburg</span>, where an aunt of mine had left prior to the war and had married my favorite uncle, and I was to their wedding in 1924. </sentence><sentence id="723">Indeed, my buddy and I took on our <span class="spatial object">jeep</span> -- no let me clarify something. </sentence><sentence id="724">Under the command my buddy and I under the command of Colonel O'Brien we accepted as interpreters the surrender of <span class="populated place">Aschaffenburg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="725">We then took the commander of <span class="populated place">Aschaffenburg</span>, who the day before had strung up several officers who had wanted to surrender. </sentence><sentence id="726">We put them on the front of our <span class="spatial object">Jeep</span> and he drove with us into <span class="region">areas</span> that had not been occupied yet by our troops, and then we were stopped. </sentence><sentence id="727">He said, put your arms down and they had one American prisoner to whom he gave a gun, and we disarmed. </sentence><sentence id="728">They disarmed voluntarily. </sentence><sentence id="729">A platoon of at least 30 or 40 men and this one American soldier, G.I. with a German rifle marched this unit back to the <span class="interior space">American P.W. cage</span>. </sentence><sentence id="730">We moved quickly and other points of interest were only days later when I had a group of six prisoners in front of me. </sentence><sentence id="731">One of them stepped out and said, "Lieutenant, didn't we go to <span class="building">school</span> together?" </sentence><sentence id="732">I picked up his helmet and I said "By God, <span class="populated place">Leslach</span>, we did." </sentence><sentence id="733">I have a picture still here in <span class="country">America</span> a class picture of 1929 or 1928 with a picture of <span class="populated place">Leslach</span>. </sentence><sentence id="734">He had been a decent guy and he said, "Couldn't you let me go <span class="building">home</span>? </sentence><sentence id="735">I love my wife so much." </sentence><sentence id="736">I said, "I love mine too, but I can't let you go <span class="building">home</span>." </sentence><sentence id="737">The next day, we took <span class="populated place">Bamberg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="738"><span class="populated place">Bamberg</span> a beautiful <span class="populated place">medieval town</span> with a magnificent <span class="building">cathedral</span> had suffered little damage and in the <span class="dlf">church yard</span> we had some 800 prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="739">It would have been a vain effort to interrogate anybody specifically because militarily speaking we had more information than they did. </sentence><sentence id="740">It was a pure coincidence that one out of these 800 stepped up to me and said, "Couldn't you let me go <span class="building">home</span>?" </sentence><sentence id="741">I come from a <span class="populated place">village</span> not far from here. </sentence><sentence id="742">And I said, "My, where are you from?" </sentence><sentence id="743">and he said, "Forth, F-O-R-T-H." This is the <span class="populated place">village</span> where I was born, where I knew every <span class="building">house</span> and <span class="building">house</span> number and every <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="744">And it seemed to me that I had known every person. </sentence><sentence id="745">So, I said to him, "But you weren't born in <span class="populated place">Forth</span>?" </sentence><sentence id="746">He said, "No, I wasn't." </sentence><sentence id="747">I said "How come that you lived in <span class="populated place">Forth</span>." " </sentence><sentence id="748">Because I married a girl from <span class="populated place">Forth</span>." " </sentence><sentence id="749">Whom did you marry?" " </sentence><sentence id="750">Gunta Haas." </sentence><sentence id="751">Gunta Haas was a year or two years younger than I was. </sentence><sentence id="752">I had known her. </sentence><sentence id="753">I said, "Gunta Haas, she lived in <span class="building">House number 35</span>." </sentence><sentence id="754">We lived in <span class="building">House number 52</span>. </sentence><sentence id="755">He said yes, <span class="building">house number 35</span> is two <span class="building">houses</span> removed from  5 the <span class="building">Protestant ministers house</span> from the <span class="building">Protestant church</span>, two <span class="building">houses</span> from the little <span class="building">fire house</span> and his pupils grew wider and wider and he said "If American Intelligence has all this information, how can we win the war?" </sentence><sentence id="756">So, now you know how we won the war. </sentence><sentence id="757">A few days later, and I'll never forget that date, Roosevelt died. </sentence><sentence id="758">We were outside of <span class="populated place">Bamberg</span> and on our way to <span class="populated place">Schnaittach</span>. </sentence><sentence id="759">The <span class="populated place">town</span> after which my family is named. </sentence><sentence id="760"><span class="populated place">Schnaittach</span> had no more Jews of course. </sentence><sentence id="761">It was the seat of the only <span class="dlf">Jewish cemetery</span> in a large area of <span class="region">central Franconia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="762">It's oldest <span class="dlf">Jewish cemetery</span> went back, so I'm told went back to the 14th century. </sentence><sentence id="763">My father and uncles and grandfathers, etc, grandmothers, are buried there in the new <span class="dlf">cemetery</span>. </sentence><sentence id="764">While we were still receiving German artillery directed towards us, the occupiers of <span class="populated place">Schnaittach</span> I visited my father's <span class="dlf">grave</span> and I never forget as I was standing there in deep deep thought and sorrow, somebody came up to me and said what are you doing there and I said, "My name is Schnaittacher." </sentence><sentence id="765">That little story seemed to have traveled to my <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="766">We didn't conquer my <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="767">It was occupied by a sister regiment. </sentence><sentence id="768">From there we went to the conquered <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span>, the <span class="populated place">town</span> I went to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="769">I interrogated the fortress commander of <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="770">I had known him. </sentence><sentence id="771">I had no particular coincidences relating to my past having lived in <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span> while occupying <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="772">We moved on across the <span class="env feature">Danube</span> and approached <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="837">Q: What information, you knew of <span class="populated place">Dachau</span> from when you lived in <span class="country">Germany</span>, but how much did you know of the <span class="populated place">camps</span> in <span class="country">Germany</span> at this point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="839">A: At this point we had very little information about <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span> generally. </sentence><sentence id="840">We had liberated, but I forgot the name of a small <span class="populated place">camp</span> which was neither extermination or <span class="populated place">torture camp</span> where we saw emaciated human beings suffering from all kinds of sicknesses, stacked up in <span class="spatial object">beds</span> with little care. </sentence><sentence id="841">That was no preparation. </sentence><sentence id="842">We had no information on <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, on <span class="populated place">Theresienstadt</span>, on <span class="populated place">Mauthausen</span>, etc. </sentence><sentence id="843">But I knew from past knowledge of <span class="populated place">Dachau</span> as a camp of torture and destruction. </sentence><sentence id="844">We arrived in <span class="populated place">Dachau</span> my <span class="building">regimental headquarters</span> in the late afternoon, or afternoon and I was asked to go to the <span class="building">camp headquarters</span>. </sentence><sentence id="845">Approaching the <span class="populated place">camp</span> in front of the <span class="dlf">gate</span> was one of these infamous <span class="spatial object">freight trains</span>. </sentence><sentence id="846">The likes of which I had never seen. </sentence><sentence id="847">The <span class="spatial object">freight train</span> was filled with corpses. </sentence><sentence id="848">Men and women who according to what we were told possibly might have been transported from the <span class="region">east</span> to the <span class="region">west</span> as the <span class="spatial object">juggernaut</span>. </sentence><sentence id="849">And, with no food, little clothing, most of them died of hunger. </sentence><sentence id="850">Those who tried to climb over the <span class="spatial object">trains</span> -- <span class="spatial object">cars</span> were shot by the SS. </sentence><sentence id="851">Yet, I couldn't resist a feeling that when a few minutes later, I saw the living cadavers the dead ones were more peaceful than the living ones. </sentence><sentence id="852">The living skeletons their beaming ravaging eyes, the torment that was obvious that they had suffered. </sentence><sentence id="853">The endless torment. </sentence><sentence id="854">I didn't get into the <span class="populated place">camp</span> otherwise to visit the <span class="building">barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="855">I passed an <span class="spatial object">oven</span> but I had no time for any personal inspection because I had to interrogate an SS Brigadefiihrer, an SS brigadier general who I first had been introduced to him or it was mentioned to me that he was someone to give us information and he was friendly and I think I shook hands with him, and later on I felt that my hand would shrivel up. </sentence><sentence id="856">Now, he claimed that he had been in <span class="populated place">Dachau</span> on an arrest and recuperation leave. </sentence><sentence id="857">That he had become a member of the SS against his wishes, yet he was grateful for it because he  6 could give personal testimony personal witness as to the crimes that had been committed. </sentence><sentence id="858">One thing which I never forget was you should not be enraged as to what you see here. </sentence><sentence id="859">Here you see little heaps in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> in <span class="populated place">Kattowice</span>, you would have seen <span class="env feature">mountains</span> of dead people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="881">Q: This is what he said to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="883">A: This is what he said to me. </sentence><sentence id="884">According to my buddy Fritzie who was involved much longer than I was in the War Crimes Trial, I believe he was hung as well. </sentence><sentence id="885">I had asked you to remember the date of May |. </sentence><sentence id="886">It is the end of my story of <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>. </sentence><sentence id="887">I went back to <span class="building">regimental headquarters</span> and the very next day or morning we moved on. </sentence><sentence id="888">We then began to experience some hopeful signs. </sentence><sentence id="889">The underground anti-Nazis tried to make contact with us. </sentence><sentence id="890">I come back again to May |. </sentence><sentence id="891">I had moved to <span class="populated place">Munich</span> on May 1, 1933. </sentence><sentence id="892">My <span class="region">division</span> conquered <span class="populated place">Munich</span> on May 1, 1945. </sentence><sentence id="893">I do think that it might be interesting to mention a few personal experiences. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="894">As soon as I did not have a regimental obligations I tried to clear up or redeem one event. </sentence><sentence id="895">I had asked you to remember the name Hermann. </sentence><sentence id="896">I had worked for him. </sentence><sentence id="897">He was my immediate boss and he was the one who prevented my uncle from entering his <span class="building">place of business</span> and ultimately to be sent to <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>. </sentence><sentence id="898">As soon as I was able to, I went to my uncle's <span class="building">place of business</span>, which had been bombed out, and I asked about Hermann and I was able to locate where he was living there. </sentence><sentence id="899">Having the ability to use a <span class="spatial object">Jeep</span>, not to drive it, I had a driver. </sentence><sentence id="900">By then I was a first lieutenant. </sentence><sentence id="901">I drove out to this little <span class="populated place">town</span> and I asked people and at that time gleefully as long as they weren't involved the Germans pointed at others, and so I arrived at the <span class="building">house</span> where Hermannn was living. </sentence><sentence id="902">He was dressed in his stocking feet and pants and underwear and long johns and I said, in very harsh German, "Go and get dressed, and come with me to <span class="populated place">Munich</span>." </sentence><sentence id="903">He didn't recognize me. </sentence><sentence id="904">His wife wailed and so did his daughter, but I could be heartless, and I loaded him on my <span class="spatial object">Jeep</span> and we went to <span class="populated place">Munich</span> where I took advantage of the friendly offer that was made by the counterintelligence and interrogated Hermann. </sentence><sentence id="905">As I mentioned or didn't mention, in accordance pursuant to army instructions and regulations would have been to go through <span class="dlf">channels</span>, but I had no time for it. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="906">Fortunately for me, in the course of the interrogation, he revealed that he was a guard at a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>, which made him subject to automatic arrest. </sentence><sentence id="907">After I concluded my interrogation, I introduced myself to him. </sentence><sentence id="908">I told him who I was and he said "But you, Herr Schnaittacher, should know how good I was to your uncle." </sentence><sentence id="909">And I said "Yes, I certainly do." </sentence><sentence id="910"> 7 Tape #3 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="911">A: My stay in <span class="populated place">Munich</span> gave me the opportunity also to meet the friend of the family, and that was a very joyous occasion. </sentence><sentence id="912">She had been working as the housekeeper for my aunt and she was overjoyed to see me and overjoyed about the end of the oppressive system. </sentence><sentence id="913">Another somewhat humorous experience reflecting upon some key reporters was the following. </sentence><sentence id="914">My division commander had learned that I lived in <span class="populated place">Munich</span> prior to the war, and so I was ordered to come to him and he said Schnaittacher I understand you had lived here before. </sentence><sentence id="915">We are expecting a bunch of newspaper men, congressmen senators, all kinds of bigwigs that want to see the birthplace of Nazism and I want you to be their guide. </sentence><sentence id="916">So I took this group on the trip and I started with the <span class="building">Odeonsplatz</span>, which is the <span class="dlf">square</span> where the Putsch had taken place in 1923 which had failed, and the legend went that courageous Hitler as firing started quickly left his troops and hid behind one of two <span class="spatial object">statues</span> and one of these key reporters profoundly thought so nothing more important to ask behind which one. </sentence><sentence id="917">The other little story goes to the <span class="building">beer hall</span> where the Putsch had started in 1923 and in the <span class="interior space">basement</span> of the <span class="building">beer hall</span> there was an <span class="building">air raid shelter</span> which was filled to some degree with stuff which had been stolen from <span class="building">Jewish homes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="918">Amongst them was a statue of a storm trooper standing on a swastika with a <span class="spatial object">German eagle</span> and the other key reporter raised the <span class="spatial object">statue</span> and said, "Did this come from a <span class="building">Jewish home</span>, too?" </sentence><sentence id="919">This I could only laugh at. </sentence><sentence id="920">My stay in <span class="populated place">Munich</span> was then a brief one. </sentence><sentence id="921">I participated in the surrender of the Hungarian Army and I do remember at the behest of my general and I do remember that the Hungarian general was really only interested in his men but in his two horses. </sentence><sentence id="922">Memories. </sentence><sentence id="923">Thereafter, I was assigned to a <span class="populated place">camp</span> in <span class="populated place">Ludwigsburg</span> near <span class="populated place">Stuttgart</span> which was an <span class="populated place">American P.W. camp</span> of so called automatic arrests. </sentence><sentence id="924">This was a very wise law that Eisenhower had released early after combat. </sentence><sentence id="925">Classifications of people would be subject to automatic arrest. </sentence><sentence id="926">Nothing noteworthy happened other than one general who revealed something that I had had no idea of that they were working on the ultimate secret weapon but I didn't know what it was. </sentence><sentence id="927">Then after a brief rest in a <span class="dlf">rest area</span>, I was transferred to the <span class="building">War Crimes Commission</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="945">Q: When was this, what month? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="947">A: I would say that should have been, could have been in July of 1945, and I was in charge of a detail that was screening the archives of the German army high command in pursuing the case of Hjalmar Schacht, the economic czar of Hitler's. </sentence><sentence id="948">I must say that we did not find any important evidence of his involvement in war crimes. </sentence><sentence id="949">Not of any national significance but a totally inhuman story was contained in a letter that I came across from a youngster who very proudly reports to someone in his family that on his 13th or 14th birthday his father gave him a rifle and three Jewish prisoners to be shot. </sentence><sentence id="950">Inhumanity beyond description. </sentence><sentence id="951">We could not make use of it as evidence in pursuing this case. </sentence><sentence id="952"> 8 </sentence></p></dialogue>
