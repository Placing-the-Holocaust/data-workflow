<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="34">A: What languages. </sentence><sentence id="35">Well, I was born w -- my -- my original language was the Austrian version of German, which incidentally has always been a little bone of contention between Germans and Austrians. </sentence><sentence id="36">Austrians feel that the only correct and proper German is spoken in <span class="country">Austria</span>, and different parts of <span class="country">Germany</span> make the same claim. </sentence><sentence id="37"><span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>, for instance, han -- <span class="populated place">Hannover</span>, they think that's -- they also think that the claims by the others are absurd, and -- and funny. </sentence><sentence id="38">I learnt a little French as a small child, we had a French teacher, a Madame come to the <span class="interior space">apartment</span> and -- and purportedly teach us French, my sister and myself. </sentence><sentence id="39">It didn't really work, didn't go much beyond "<span class="populated place">Frere Jacques</span>." </sentence><sentence id="40">And we didn't really like her; that didn't help. </sentence><sentence id="41">And -- however, when -- in my <span class="building">school system</span>, we took a fir -- a foreign language from the age of 11, and I chose French. </sentence><sentence id="42">The teacher who taught French also taught German and was the fore-master of my <span class="building">class</span>. </sentence><sentence id="43">So he was the administrative, disciplinary head of that class. </sentence><sentence id="44">And he wa -- turned out to be one of the well known arch-Nazis of <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>. </sentence><sentence id="45">A published author, who when the Austrian This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="46">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="47"> Interview with Peter Masters deg August 7, 1998 <span class="building">writers club</span>, the <span class="building">Pen Club</span>, the <span class="building">International Pen Club</span>, Austrian branch sent a telegram to their Jewish colleagues in <span class="country">Germany</span> to express their sympathy upon their book burning and treatment, there were two Austrian authors who refused to sign the otherwise unanimous declaration, and he was one of them. </sentence><sentence id="48">I got barely passing grades in German, which was my best subject, and I switched to the <span class="building">English class</span> because of him. </sentence><sentence id="49">Solely because of him. </sentence><sentence id="50">So I had four years of <span class="building">high school</span> English and I thought I spoke fluent English. </sentence><sentence id="51">That was disillusioned fairly quickly upon arrival in <span class="country">England</span>, but I could get by fairly well. </sentence><sentence id="52">I learned a little Spanish before I left. </sentence><sentence id="53">This was really emigration learning other things type of thing. </sentence><sentence id="54">But I don't think there was enough of it to have any impact. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="77">Q: Where were you on V-E day, when victory was declared in <span class="country">Europe</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="79">A: Victory in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="80">I'm trying to think. </sentence><sentence id="81">The -- the -- strangely perhaps, the impact was not enormous on us because we had felt pretty solidly that we had won, so the -- the fact of the -- of it becoming official was relatively minor. </sentence><sentence id="82">The date, if I recall, was May -- May eight, May eight. </sentence><sentence id="83">At May eight, I believe I was in <span class="building">cadet school</span> in <span class="country">England</span>, and there was a little bit of razzmatazz of people celebrating, cheering, what have you. </sentence><sentence id="84">And it -- I think many of the cadets thought that now they were more likely to go to <span class="region">the Orient</span> than before. </sentence><sentence id="85">And that concerned me only marginally because I thought the British would surely send me somewhere where my fluent German would make sense. </sentence><sentence id="86">I -- I made some halfhearted efforts to get sent to This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="87">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="88"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Peter Masters deg August 7, 1998 <span class="country">Austria</span> because that would have interested me, and besides, being to <span class="country">Germany</span> for the first time ever, during the fighting, and I had a distaste for going to <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="89">Some of our people were there and sort of lived it up in occupation, but didn't attract me. </sentence><sentence id="90">The -- the -- the problem as to -- who was and who wasn't a Nazi and so on had already come up when -- when we were fighting in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="91">And I was told that chances of getting to <span class="country">Austria</span> were minimal because they were being supplied from central Mediterranean forces, meaning from <span class="country">Italy</span>, whereas <span class="country">Germany</span> was being supplied by personnel from <span class="region">northwest Europe</span>, from -- from our end. </sentence><sentence id="92">Th-The -- the army has its own ways and when it came up, where I did go was <span class="region">West Africa</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="109">Q: Before I have you going to <span class="region">West Africa</span>, can you tell me, in May of 1945, what was your rank, and what -- what action had you seen during the war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="111">A: St-Starting at the beginning, when I was in the Pioneer corps, I was a private and I saw no chance of ever getting promoted to anything, because I was just one of the younger lads who was unloading <span class="spatial object">trains</span> or testing bridging material and so on. </sentence><sentence id="112">And I --I wasn't one of the <span class="spatial object">boot polisher</span> and <span class="spatial object">button polishers</span>, so I-- I wasn't a standout to the people on the <span class="dlf">parade ground</span> by any means. </sentence><sentence id="113">In-In fact, I was a bit of a nonconformist [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="114">I was more likely to get in trouble about something than I was to get promoted. </sentence><sentence id="115">So, when I came to the commandos, just prior to D-Day, I was made a lance corporal, which was a big deal. </sentence><sentence id="116">It -- it's nothing This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="117">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="118"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Peter Masters " August 7, 1998 really, but as such I was the second in command of my detachment, a five man team, attached to number six commando, we were number 10 commando at- attaching teams to eight different commandos for D-Day. </sentence><sentence id="119">So, I was a lance corporal and was subsequently promoted to be a corporal in the <span class="dlf">field</span>, which caused a little argument because | said to my colleague and sergeant, who said, I'm making you a corporal and I said, you know, jokingly, want me to stitch on an extra stripe here in -- in the <span class="dlf">front line</span>? </sentence><sentence id="120">And he said, you're damn right. </sentence><sentence id="121">And I said I-- you -- you mean you have the authority to make me a paid corporal? </sentence><sentence id="122">And he said, who said anything about paid? </sentence><sentence id="123">And I came back as a corporal, largely because one of our detachments had been wiped out and I became a one man detachment. </sentence><sentence id="124">When I came back I was promoted to sergeant and when we went out to <span class="country">Holland</span> and <span class="country">Germany</span> again, I was a sergeant. </sentence><sentence id="125">And it was then that one of our own, who had been -- who -- who had become the commanding officer of our detachments, Kurt Gowza(ph) who served under the name of James Griffith, wanted to send me to <span class="building">cadet school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="126">And I said, at this stage, it's late in the war, do you think it's worthwhile? </sentence><sentence id="127">And I don't want to do the <span class="dlf">parade square</span> bashing and -- and -- and pamphlet bullshitting, I just don't want to do it. </sentence><sentence id="128">And he persuaded me to do it, with the help of the brigade major, Sir Maxwell Hopagow(ph). </sentence><sentence id="129">He -- they -- they li-- I wanted to talk to the brigadier, if -- if -- if a commission then happened in the <span class="dlf">field</span>, Montgomery was against commissions in the <span class="dlf">field</span> unless from dire need, casualties, because he said it leads This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="130">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="131"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Peter Masters deg August 7, 1998 to fraternization through the enlisted men. </sentence><sentence id="132">Which we thought was just fine, and he apparently as a [indecipherable] thought was in -- improper. </sentence><sentence id="133">This is sort of regular army smokiness, you know, and -- and he s -- he stopped quite -- quite a few of us got commissions in the <span class="dlf">field</span> because they were doing a good job. </sentence><sentence id="134">And I -- I fairly likely m-might have gotten one, but when I was transferred from one <span class="spatial object">unit</span> to the other, I had to start from <span class="dlf">square one</span> to build my reputation of being keen and determined and willing to do anything and so on. </sentence><sentence id="135">Which I did. </sentence><sentence id="136">And it led to the i-- the notion of going to <span class="building">cadet school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="137">I went to <span class="building">cadet school</span>, and I must say I had a ball. </sentence><sentence id="138">The fact that I-- I m-- I remember arriving and there were a whole bunch of youngsters out of -- out of <span class="building">school</span> who were going to <span class="building">cadet school</span> and they were studying pamphlets. </sentence><sentence id="139">And they ask questions from the pamphlets and I had no idea what th-the answers were, b-but I said, I don't know the name of the plunger of the -- this weapon, but we had a rather specialized version of that weapon for a special operation. </sentence><sentence id="140">Then suddenly everybody is listening and they want to know. </sentence><sentence id="141">Well, when it came to the tests, the same thing happened. </sentence><sentence id="142">Some -- some weapon sergeant would ask questions and say, ask me about the <span class="spatial object">Sten gun</span>. </sentence><sentence id="143">| said, Sten gun was not a commando weapon, we used Thompsons, which are a higher quality. </sentence><sentence id="144">And the only Sten gun I've ever seen was one -- a special one for an operation with a silencer. </sentence><sentence id="145">He said, a--a Sten with a silencer?

</sentence><sentence id="159">Hands go up and the cadets -- the cadet kept asking questions, you see. </sentence><sentence id="160">And they said, to carry out flanking attacks, and somebody else said something else, and when it was my turn, I said none. </sentence><sentence id="161">The <span class="spatial object">Bren gun carrier</span> is no use. </sentence><sentence id="162">I have seen more burnt out <span class="spatial object">Bren gun carriers</span> than -- than non- burned out <span class="spatial object">Bren gun carriers</span>. </sentence><sentence id="163">It's a little [indecipherable] not enough armament. </sentence><sentence id="164">And I said, it is useful possibly for two things, which is to bring up the tea after battle, or if you have nothing and want to fake like you have armor, you run them off somewhere where nobody can see them and the enemy will think you're coming with a lot of <span class="spatial object">tanks</span>, because they make such a racket that they inevitably get shot at This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="165">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="166"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Peter Masters me August 7, 1998 and -- and -- and then that's when they burn. </sentence><sentence id="167">And the instructor said, th-that Masters is absolutely right, because he had just come back from <span class="country">Italy</span> himself, so he knew what I am saying is true, you see? </sentence><sentence id="168">So -- so after awhile I found out wasn't that much --I mean, I wa -- it wasn't working the way I had thought. </sentence><sentence id="169">I -- I thought I'd be a rebel and I found the management agreed with me. </sentence><sentence id="170">Which was in a way, of course, a big help and gratifying and so I graduated very high in my class, and that's the end of that one. </sentence><sentence id="171">Tha -- you asked me what rank I was when I graduated. </sentence><sentence id="172">I was, of course, a second lieutenant and was subsequently promoted during my service in <span class="country">Africa</span>, aut -- almost automatically to first lieutenant and then my time was up. </sentence><sentence id="173">Six years. </sentence><sentence id="174">It was age plus length of service in the British army. </sentence><sentence id="175">So my number was up and I -- somebody wanted me to stay as an instructor at the <span class="building">school of infantry</span> and I said thank you but no thank you. </sentence><sentence id="176">Why not? </sentence><sentence id="177">Well, I said, In --1--I---I relish the illusion of freedom, that I can go wherever I want, whenever I want and not be sent. </sentence><sentence id="178">I've been sent for a number of years now. </sentence><sentence id="179">So even bef -- realizing it's an illusion, enough. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="255">A: Never saw one. </sentence><sentence id="256">Some of -- few of us did. </sentence><sentence id="257">This really depended on what <span class="spatial object">unit</span> you were with, and -- and -- and chance. </sentence><sentence id="258">And you have to bear in mind, commandos were essentially <span class="building">assault units</span>. </sentence><sentence id="259">And then they -- th-the -- the people in charge always This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="260">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="261"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Peter Masters " August 7, 1998 stretched what was an initial assault way beyond our normal role, because we didn't have heavy support weapons, you know. </sentence><sentence id="262">But they had us, so they kept us. </sentence><sentence id="263">And if you didn't happen -- well, it -- it just so happened that no <span class="populated place">concentrat-tration camp</span> was in the path of where they wanted a -- a-a-a -- an assault made. </sentence><sentence id="264">These were usually <span class="dlf">river crossings</span> that they used us for, after the -- the initial landings at -- on D-Day or in <span class="country">Italy</span> or in <span class="region">Sicily</span> or in <span class="country">Holland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="265">So, one of our people of course, as you know, heard his parents might be alive in <span class="populated place">Terezin</span> and went to -- to go -- go get them, and succeeded. </sentence><sentence id="266">That was extremely gratifying. </sentence><sentence id="267">None of us, the rest of us even have the slightest opportunity to do that. </sentence></p></dialogue>

again. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2700">Understandably, the Austro-Hungarians never had any dream of becoming a powerful empire again, because that would mean gluing together the thing where the glue hadn't held, o-of -- of -- of ethnic minorities, you see? </sentence><sentence id="2701">So they never had that ambition, except perhaps in the case of some Austrians who were pan -- pan- German thinkers, and thought as part of the <span class="country">German empire</span>, they could see some greatness again. </sentence><sentence id="2702">But I wouldn't say there were many until Hitler

</sentence><sentence id="3610">Then they bought the movie option, that doesn't mean they are making the movie just yet, although they assigned a writer and a producer, which is promising.

all the other things that are happening in conjunction with it. </sentence><sentence id="3632">So, that's what it ta -- it takes as far as I'm concerned, and look, if the movie doesn't turn out as I

</sentence><sentence id="3711">Now, I have nothing against lawyers per se, but with the very specialized methodology of American education, unlike some European educations, which in my opinion emphasize general knowledge and a general sort of Renaissance view of not knowing only your subject, but also the arts and literature and music and something of a-at least basic something. </sentence><sentence id="3712">This does not necessarily hold in this <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3713">And it's perfectly possible to be a brilliant lawyer and have absolutely -- if-- if you were asked to name three American sculptors, they couldn't do it. </sentence><sentence id="3714">Which is astonishing, you know?
