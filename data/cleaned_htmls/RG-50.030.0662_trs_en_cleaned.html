<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really? What a coincidence.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I remember one day I was huffing and puffing climbing a mountain and I said, I'm not used to this. I said, I grew up in Chicago where -- where I'm used to escalators and elevators.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now given that you had had very different ideas about what was going to happen before you got the desk job, before your friend finds you in the foxhole, so during those months, how are you coping with the disappointment? Is it a disappointment?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: It wasn't. I mean, I just took it as life; something to cope with.

Because you were not drafted. You were -- you were a volunteer. Did you enjoy any perks? Was there anything given to you as a reward for that or you were just treated the same?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My impression was that there were a lot of enlisted personnel in our outfit because it was an old Panama outfit. It was a regular Army outfit, Sth Infantry.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So those were not draftees?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But instead of Company F, which is a line company, and I was on mortar. I was a 60- milimeter mortar ammunition bearer.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You know, I'ma little confused about prisoners of -- German prisoners of war that were huddled together in trucks and they were carried, they were driven away from where they were captured and prisoners of -- and concentration camp prisoners with the striped uniforms in trucks. It seems to me that I saw them in trucks, too but I'm not sure that they were rescued and carried and that I -- we passed some of them on the roads. I don't know, I just felt that I knew about concentration camps and prisoners well before that time and that we saw some.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was there from September to May "46. And we were very-- we were very aggressive in pursuing Nazis and getting them out of office.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And some people -- I mean I understand the Germans themselves felt that it wasn't worth doing or something, I don't know. One -- I remember one Nazi party official that we removed from office said to me that he had -- he had his days of glory and now -- and now it's turned over, so, you know, it's --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It's sort of worth it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In what language did you interrogate these people? How did you deal with the -- <span class="page-break" number="67"></span> Insdg http://collections.ushmm.org</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So he was an interpreter.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: By the way, have you ever come across the name of a American lawyer by the name of Kemp -- not American, German lawyer by the name of Kempner (ph)?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Kempner?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Kempner, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Sounds familiar.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Because apparently he is -- was a -- a -- a lawyer who interrogated also this -- these kind of people, people who had been in office, who had --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh, uh-huh.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- held government jobs and trying to find out how much did they know what was going on --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- and were they in favor of it or not, and so apparently he -- you know, he became quite well known. That's maybe why the name is familiar to you. Yeah, Kempner was the name. He was a German interrogating his own people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah. Okay. So how -- let's see, did they honestly cooperate or did they just want to escape punishment and, therefore, participated in the program?

The people who were --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The people who were supposed to be denazified.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The people who were screened?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, they filled out the fragebogen and handed it in.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That was my question, too: How honest were the answers or could you assess that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, that's an interesting question because a lot of -- many Germans came from the east zone.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And there were no records to check on their responses, but in our zone, in our area, Regensburg itself --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- had an intact record center that had all the Nazi records. So people from the local area we could check on, so we had --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- so we had a routine check in the records center --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Uh-huh, yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- in Regensburg on everybody, but people who came from Poland or East Germany,--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah. <span class="page-break" number="69"></span> Insdg http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- whatever, we had no way of checking on them, so of course they were more sus -- they were more suspicious.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh. So you think that some of them really -- well, let me ask you this then: How did you determine who -- whom to get into the program?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Who --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: How did you choose the individual that you thought would qualify to be in the program and be denazified?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: 1 -- I don't know. We didn't -- we didn't choose.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Somebody chose.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Military government, I don't know. We -- we were -- we were the evaluators, --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I see, I see.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- but we didn't do the initial choice.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So you were handed a list of people --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see, I understand. And then you did your best to try and get the Nazi ideology out of them, huh?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not to get the Nazi ideology out of them, but to keep the ones that were more serious Nazis out of -- out of important jobs.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I mean we didn't expect to change their ideology. <span class="page-break" number="70"></span> Insdg http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And -- {coughing} excuse me. And how did you -- you were a young person, as you mentioned earlier.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did you feel to carry out such a difficult burden? I mean in a way from a human point of view this is quite a -- a hard burden to carry because you decide on somebody's future in a way.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not at all, it was a joy.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was glad to do it. It was revenge.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Well, that I can understand, right. Now, how was the --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I was -- you know, I'm Jewish.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I know, I know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So I -- you know, I saw that as a -- as a good kind of revenge.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see, uh-huh. And -- well, okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My interpreter was also Jewish, he was -- he was a German Jewish refugee who was in the Army.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah. Well, many of them came --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- at an age here to America and then enlisted in the Army, that's right.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, that's in the north.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, yeah. Okay. Now, what was the procedure, was this program conducted on a one -- one-on-one basis or did you have groups at the same time, and how exactly did you proceed in this project, in this program of denazification?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, we had the fragebogens.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And they would come in, and they would have to be evaluated.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And we had a staff of evaluators that were about 30 people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, I see, uh-huh, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And there were -- they went over them and -- and they would come to me and say this one looks suspicious or this one, you know, and so on, but they would -- there were -- there were procedures to follow.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see, okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So you followed a protocol, in other words?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah. <span class="page-break" number="72"></span> Insdg http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Uh-huh, I see, okay. But then -- and then let's say now you have chosen 10 or 20 or 30 of these individuals. Was it conducted like in a classroom or was it conducted on a one- to-one basis?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, one-to-one.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It was one-to-one?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, each -- each questionnaire was --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- was a -- it was a separate investigation, a separate procedure for each individual.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was the procedure?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The procedure was to evaluate their questionnaire and to come up with a rating in -- there were five categories.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh, I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You know, you know those five categories: Number one is mandatory removal, number two is -- is discretionary adverse recommendation, number three is discretionary no recommendation, number four is no evidence of anti -- no evidence of Nazi activity, and number five was evidence of anti-Nazi activity.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And so each individual would get a rating.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. <span class="page-break" number="73"></span> Insdg http://collections.ushmm.org</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That would be the conclusion. And then if they were in the four or five, they would be removed from office or not hired and their bank account would be frozen and their property could be seized and used by the Allies, by the Americans for, you know, like homes could be used for troops.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh, yeah. And how long did such a process take?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The evaluation process?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes, uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Just -- just -- it was -- I don't know, I would say anywhere from an hour to a couple of days.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh, I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It depended on if there were any complications, because we also had a special investigations unit that would look into difficult case -- cases that were, you know, harder to figure out.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right, right, uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They -- you know, they might -- they might go to -- to interrogate some other people or try to get other records or whatever.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Uh-huh. Or did you interview members of their family or --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- I don't know what -- uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Or friends or -- <span class="page-break" number="74"></span> Insdg http://collections.ushmm.org</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: either. Most -- the action in most cases was taken on the basis of the questionnaire alone.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh, I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We would bring them in for interviews if we had questions.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see, I see. Oh, you mean you got the fragebogen, that you evaluated, but you didn't necessarily have the individual in front of you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Uh-huh, I see. I didn't realize that. Now I suppose I had a -- I had a different concept somewhat. I thought that after you went through the fragebogen and you decided who was suspicious or wasn't suspicious, that they somehow got some kind of a -- I don't want to call it brainwashing, but some kind of a, you know, democratic viewpoint or -- or --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh, no, no. No, it was strictly --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Based on their fragebogen.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was, yeah, strictly screening, no attempt to change them or argue with them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And were they cooperative, were they hostile, antagonistic or --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, I would say the main attitude was to try to get out of it, you know, to say that they were innocent.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Oh --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: "Nicht Nazi, Nicht Nazi" was -- was their motto. There was one case -- -</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, that was easy to say afterwards.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: There was one case I remember where this man said that-- that he understands that the tables were turned and he had his days of glory and now his side has lost and he's <span class="page-break" number="75"></span> Insdg http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection prepared to take the consequences, and he -- you know, he said well, we had our day and now you have your day. Well, that was very unusual.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh, to admit that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: For anybody to do that. Most of them were--made excuses. You know, they said they were forced or that they were not really a Nazi and so on. And of course the people from -- who came from East Germany, there was no way to check.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's the other big problem, exactly, right. So I was-- one of the questions I had in my mind was: Was any material used during this process, but I guess it wasn't "cause I had a different concept of it at all.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I thought there were lectures being given on democracy or lectures --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh, no. There was no attempt to change anybody. It was completely screening.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh. And get the least suspicious back into the workforce?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The what?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I said and then to get the least suspicious individuals back into the working force?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, to -- well, to allow them to continue in their -- on their jobs.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Or to be hired.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah, I understand, yeah. Okay. Let's see now, what qualifications did you have or required in order to be part of this process?

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The person in charge of the whole thing was an officer, a captain.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And he -- and there was also a lieutenant, so I remember there were two American officers that were in charge, but the day-to-day work was done by -- the day-to-day work of -- of being in charge, I mean, --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- was done by an enlisted man.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And my predecessor was the one who was being discharged. He was also a Jewish guy --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- from the States.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The title was chief clerk.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see, good, very good. Were there Germans that participated under oath?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Germans --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Well, let's say those who filled out the fragebogen -- fragebogen, and was there anywhere where they had to, I don't know, sign that -- like we say here in the United States --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I think -- I think --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You know, to whatever I wrote that --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I think they signed it -- I think they -- when they signed it it said -- it probably said in there that something about --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But they were not under any verbal oath or anything like that?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, they -- I think they got away with too much, quite honestly, but never mind.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>Well, that was another question I had: How could you be sure that what they put down in their fragebogen was an honest answer? But I think you answered that already and you could --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The record center.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah. You could check it unless they came from the east? <span class="page-break" number="78"></span> Insdg http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. Well, that's, of course, a big problem, but -- and that I guess wasn't really eliminated until the "90s, right, when they got records.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What did you hope to achieve with this denazification program?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Cleansing. Well, to keep the new Germany, the new German government more democratic, and not -- not back in the hands of the Nazis.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And do you think you succeeded?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We succeeded in -- in our job, but we understand that the new German government kind of weakened and we had heard that Nazis were being kept or hired again.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And that was under Adenauer or --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Well, I guess you were dealing here with what, 52 million people or however many --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So you told me already where you were located, right? In -- in Regensburg --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- or where was --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Regensburg on the...</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. And that's where -- where your work was concentrated, in that part of Bavaria?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How long did you work in this capacity?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I was there from September of "45 through May of "46. <span class="page-break" number="79"></span> Insdg http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: At the time that I was in a DP camp in Italy.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Beyond that even, until August, I guess, of "46. Okay. What were some of the most memorable incidents that you remember from that period? You already told me about the guy who said you had your day --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I mean we had our day, now you have your day. I'm sure you came across a number of other memorable incidents with these people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I think one was when the statistics came out to show that we had the highest number of removals in the whole US zone.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh. The highest removal?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's interesting.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, the highest number.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Well, Bavaria is sort of Hitler country --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- perhaps that's why.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Munich, that's part of it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Also, we had heard --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah. <span class="page-break" number="80"></span> Insdg http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- that the British were sitting and having tea with the Nazis, and that the French, I don't know -- the French were either very vengeful or just didn't care, but that the United States forces were the most serious about denazification, so we were proud that we were doing a good job.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Uh-huh, okay. But specifically on a one-to-one from an individual, do you have any memorable incidents that occurred with, you know, you speaking to any of these people or in conversation or --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I don't -- I don't remember any specific.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see. Now, you think that the program was effective?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, it was effective while we were doing it, but it was -- but it was overturned; you know, it was watered down and then it was done away with.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: How soon would you think was it watered down? I think that really is also an important point because was there already a new younger generation coming in or --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, not while we were there. It was after -- we heard that it was done afterward, probably in late "46.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What, that they over turned this program?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's what I heard.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh. Were any other highlights that you remember during this period? I mean some really heavy duty Nazis that were discovered in this way? I assume that perhaps through the fragebogen you did discover some --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh, yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Anybody specific? <span class="page-break" number="81"></span> Insdg http://collections.ushmm.org</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I don't think so.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. What about -- or how was it justified that some of the Nazis scientists, etcetera, ended up here?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, I don't know. I don't know anything about that. I guess the United States needed them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Or they would have fallen into the hands of the -- of the -- of the other side.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you think -- well, let me ask you this: What are some of the strengths or weaknesses of this program?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I think -- the weakness was not having record centers -- not having records on people who came from other areas.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, yeah, yeah, right, right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Other than that, I think it was done very well.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: You know, and they were serious and people were removed and gradually jobs were -- were given to people who were not Nazis. There weren't many -- there weren't many around, you know. There was -- practically everybody was in the Nazi party because of the mandatory membership --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- from "37 on. <span class="page-break" number="82"></span> Insdg http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: {Coughing} excuse me. No, that I realize and that, of course, very difficult to make this distinction and then to be sure that --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, very difficult. Did you -- were you able to -- to obtain lists of Nazi party members?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: As I recall, there was one time when -- when somebody uncovered a record or a list of -- of -- of members that we could check against -- against our applicants. It was kind of a surprise treasure that was uncovered.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I can imagine, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And probably to the great disappointment of some of the people --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah, right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: There you had it black and white, huh?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. I had a question of how were the candidates for denazification chosen?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was a routine thing on their job. It was because of what -- what position -- I guess -- I guess it was, you know, everybody in certain jobs in the government or in important positions in society.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: That you really needed in order to --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: We didn't -- we didn't select them, they were -- we received -- we received them, somebody else selected them. <span class="page-break" number="83"></span> Insdg http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Made the selection. When you say somebody else, you mean from among the allies, not from within the Germans themselves?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I guess so. I don't -- I don't really know. It might be that an order went in from military government that everybody in a certain industry had to submit a fragebogen.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see, okay, uh-huh. So really everything, all the -- all the selection, and I hate to use that word for obvious reasons, but let's -- let's just use it for lack of a better word, so all the selections were really based entirely on the fragebogen?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: On -- all the selection?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, who was going to be denazified or not.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh. Well, it started with the fragebogen.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Then if there were questions or suspicions, then -- then there would be interviews and further investigations.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you do some of the interviews yourself as well?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Did what?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did you do personally some of the interviews yourself or --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No. We had an American GI originally from Germany who was a special investigator and he would -- he would do them.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: He would do the --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Interviews. And he -- and he would do the -- he would do further investigation.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see. So really was a whole team work?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh, yeah, absolutely. <span class="page-break" number="84"></span> Insdg http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh. Now, the -- the workload must have been overwhelming, as we said before, dealing with a whole nation?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, we only had one state.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, did this -- that's a good answer because that brings me to another question. Did you -- did the United States have such programs all over Germany?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes. It was in the -- the whole US zone --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- was divided into areas and all of them had the same kind of thing we did.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see, I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We were just -- we were just in one state.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You're just the -- the --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Niederbayern and obersfeldt.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Niederbayern, yeah. Oh, I see. This really was a very well organized undertaking.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I mean -- so what would you say, roughly how many people in your sector, on your section were involved in this? Germans, I mean.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, I -- the population?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>

I don't remember.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, it was a vast undertaking. And you -- you -- you talk about the Americans having done that, and I was not aware of that either that -- that this was not an allied undertaking. I always was under the impression that this was a cooperative undertaking.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, this was American.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I see. And the other --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And the others had their own systems.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh. Did they also call it denazification?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't think so.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't know what they had. I mean we -- we had heard that -- that -- that the British were having tea with the Nazis and the French were just wrecking their stores and homes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So not -- not --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh, and the Russians were terrible, you know.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, I know that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Everybody ran away from the Russians --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- and said that they were monsters.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right. Now that I heard --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Because they were so -- they were so vengeful --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right, even from --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- at the destruction that the Germans did of Russia. <span class="page-break" number="86"></span> Insdg http://collections.ushmm.org</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. So let me ask you this: What would you say, how-- how did this experience affect you as a young person in such a responsible position, you know, which involved really impacting the course of people's lives? Were you aware of your power, were you troubled by the fact that you did not have experience in that area?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, actually, I think it matured me. I enjoyed it. We lived well. I mean we had -- we had a hotel room, we had a -- we had -- we -- you know, we lived in a hotel, we had dances, we had an orchestra, we had a bar, we -- I had a girlfriend. We had a chauffeur to go wherever we wanted to, like to a play or an opera or concert. It was -- it was a very educational experience.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I mean I was -- I was so young. I had -- I had three years of college credit, which I had done in two years.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And so, you know, --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did you pursue that psychology at the end?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, I went on and got a PhD in psychology.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I guess people are very resilient.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Well --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, Regensburg wasn't -- wasn't wrecked as much as some other cities.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I know, I know.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, yeah. And were you -- well, you said you enjoyed it, so | assume you enjoyed the feeling of having power over these people?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, it wasn't that, it was just having an important job.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Important job, too.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And having a lot of the luxuries of -- of, you know, living well.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right, right, right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I mean there were also the problems of being away from home and living in -- still living in a hostile environment. I mean we weren't -- you know, it was dangerous to walk down the streets alone at night.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You just asked -- you just answered my next question, which really was How dangerous or how hostile were these people against the -- well, the allies in general but the United States Army soldiers that were in --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, they were -- there were always stories about an attack. You know, there were -- there were German Army veterans, was Hitler Youth former members, there were true believers. There were stories that there were attacks on GIs and -- but I don't remember <span class="page-break" number="88"></span> Insdg http://collections.ushmm.org</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection that anybody in our unit was attacked, but -- but we were always careful. I mean I remember walk -- walking down the street myself at night, like if I took my girlfriend home, and then I would walk back to my hotel, I would carry a knife.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see. So one really did need a little bit of protection after all.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You were not welcomed with open arms?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, no. Although many of them acted that way.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah, yeah. Well --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh, yeah, they acted that way.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, it probably netted them some chocolate and nylon stockings and other things.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's right, and they were glad the war was over.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. Well, that's for sure.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And cigarettes were very important, cigarettes and chocolate and stockings, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What days these were, oh, my God. I remember them quite well still. Well, I had a question whether, you know, you had to follow a protocol in this process or whether it was, you know, partially your own instinct to realize who was honest, who was not honest, etcetera? What guided your -- your work more, the protocol that you had to follow or the instinct that you felt when confronting some of these fragebogen?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Probably both. You know, for instance if there was a contradiction in dates or functions or -- see | -- I didn't -- I wasn't an evaluator myself, I was the head of the unit, so the evaluator would come to me with a question. They would say here's -- here's a <span class="page-break" number="89"></span> Insdg http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection fragebogen where this guy answers this and this place and that on that place and it looks like a contradiction and so on, so they would come to me with questions.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But they would -- they would do the evaluations, I wouldn't, but I would train them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see, uh-huh. Now, another question just came to my mind. Most of Germany was mobilized into the Army.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And these people that you dealt with were people who were holding office jobs or -- or were working for the government in a -- in a different capacity.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Not in the Army.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did they -- how did they manage to stay out of the Army?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I -- [have no idea.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But these guys, in other words, had -- that you were dealing with had not been in -- in the military in the Wehrnacht?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I'm -- I don't know. I think some were -- some were in both.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Civilian and had been in the Army too.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't know. I think they were in the Army and then they were -- this was peace time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Well, just a few months, yeah, they may have been -- <span class="page-break" number="90"></span> Insdg http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- demobilized by that time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right. So maybe the records show that they were in the Nazi party and then they were in the Army and now they were out in a job and they were being screened in the job.</p></p></dialogue>

Well I was very much interested to hear and I also listened a little bit to the original interview. What your function was after World War II. How did you get involved with the de-Nazification and why were you chosen to be part of that program.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well I was, I was in the infantry and we were in occupation in Augsburg and I was just bored I guess. And I heard about military government needing people so I applied for a transfer and I got it and they transferred me to Regensburg and when I went to, was put into public safety special branch. And it turned out that the head of de-Nazification, the enlisted man who was the head of, the title was Chief Clerk, that he was leaving in a few days. And I had a few years of college credit in psychology and I guess they thought that, that I could do it. So I was only 22 years old but I wanted it and they thought I could do it. So they trained me to fill his spot.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I suppose it was quite a challenge for you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes it was.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now in this respect, how successful do you think that this program worked out. <span class="page-break" number="152"></span> Insdg http://collections.ushmm.org</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well in our district which was the state was Niederbeir and Oberfaus where Regensburg is. We had the highest number of what you call it screenings. We had the highest number of evaluations and removals of people from their jobs, Nazis, than anyone else in the US Zone. We had, we were very successful.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When you say successful do you think that it had an impact on the Nazis. To well let's say never mind repent but that they realized finally how wrong they had gone or how criminal their government had been or do you think that they did this mostly so that they would be spared from trials or prison or worse.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well they didn't do it. We did it. We removed them. We evaluated them. And this is the US government. It wasn't the Germans.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: No, no I understand. I know that. but I was just wondering</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: We removed them from office in important jobs like in the government and in important jobs, administrative jobs and we removed thousands. And that was our mission. To cleanse the new government of Nazis as much as possible, at the higher levels. I mean at the lower levels, there were many Nazi party members but we kept, if they were, if they had joined the party after summer of 37, they were considered ok.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Because then they were forced.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: If they hadn't held any po, any official position.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The reason that you felt that way is because at that point they were forced, whether they liked it or not.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was mandatory that they joined.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right, well my question really my next question actually was who were the individuals you were dealing with and had they been officials during the Nazi regime. So in a way you have answered that already.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You said that they were, they had been in the government</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you think that those who went into the party after 37, but in their hearts they were not Nazis. Do you think A Oh, I don't know. No I think it was mixed I'm sure. That some believed in it and some were didn't and were forced into it. <span class="page-break" number="153"></span> Insdg http://collections.ushmm.org</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: How do you think what was the reaction on the part of these Germans. They were removed from their office, by the United States military and what was their reaction to being chosen to be de-Nazified. I assume that some were beyond that. In other words, that they you know either ended up in prison or could not be used in</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yeah well the ones who were suspected of being war criminals, we didn't, we didn't process them. We turned them over to counter intelligence, you know to intelligence. And but we didn't deal with those.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you had good reason to think that the people you were dealing with it was worthwhile trying to change them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Isee.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, it didn't last long though. We understood, I understand that it changed about you know in 1946 I think it was, late 1946. I was there only until May 46. I was there from September to May 46. And we were very, we were very aggressive in pursuing Nazis and getting them out of office. And some people I mean I understand the Germans themselves felt that it wasn't worth doing or something. I don't know. One I remember one Nazi party official that we removed from office. Said to me that he had his days of glory and now it's turned over so you know it's wasn't worth it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: In what language did you interrogate these people. How did you</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well I had a German American. I had an American originally from Germany as an interpreter. He was in the army and so he was an interpreter.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: By the way have you ever come across the name of an American lawyer by the name of Kent, no not American, German lawyer by the name of Kempner.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Kempner</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Kempner. Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Sounds familiar.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh because apparently he is was a lawyer who interrogated also these kind of people, people who had been in office, who had held government jobs and trying to find out how much did they know. What was going on. Were they in favor of it or not and so on. And apparently he you know he became quite well known. That's maybe he was, why the name is familiar to you. Yeah, Kempner is his name. He was German interrogating his own people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Unh hunh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Ok so did they honestly cooperate or did they just want to escape punishment and <span class="page-break" number="154"></span> Insdg http://collections.ushmm.org</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well that's an interesting question because a lots, many Germans came from the east zone. And there were no records to check on their responses. But in our zone, in our area, Regensburg itself had an intact record center that had all the Nazi records. So people from the local area we could check on. So we had so we had a routine check in the record center, in Regensburg on everybody. People who came from Poland or east Germany, whatever, we had no way of checking on them so of course they were more susp, they were more suspicious.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you think that some of them really well let me ask you this then. How did you determine who was to get into the program.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Who?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah how did you choose the individuals that you thought would qualify to be in the program and be de-Nazified.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I, don't know. We didn't choose. Somebody chose. Military government, I don't' know. We were the evaluators, but we didn't' do the initial choice.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you were handed a list of people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see. I understand and then you did your best to try and get the Nazi ideology out of them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well not to get the Nazi ideology out of them but to, to keep the ones that were more serious Nazis out of important jobs. I mean we didn't expect to change their ideology. <span class="page-break" number="155"></span> Insdg http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And how did you, you were a young person as you mentioned earlier. How did you feel to carry out such a difficult burden. I mean in a way from a human point of view, this is quite a hard burden to carry because you decide on somebody's future in a way.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not at all. It was a joy.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh ok.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>A; I was glad to do it. it was a revenge.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Well that I can understand, right. Now how was the</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: You know I'm Jewish.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I know, I know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So I you know I saw that as a good kind of revenge.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see. And well ok.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My interpreter was also Jewish. He was a German Jewish refugee who was in the army.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah well many of them came at an age here to America and then enlisted in the army.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>That's right. you know I come from that part of the world too. I am originally from Hamburg.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yeah, well that's in the north.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Ok now what was the procedure. Was this program conducted on one, on a one on one basis or did you have groups at the same time and how exactly did you proceed in this project, in this program of de-Nazification.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well we had the fragebogens. And they would come in and they would have to be evaluated. And we had a staff of evaluators that were about 30 people. And there were they went over them and they would come to me with say this one looks suspicious and this one. You know and so on but there were, there were procedures to follow.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see ok, so you followed a protocol in other words.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Ok but then and then let's say now you have chosen 10 or 20 or 30 these individuals. It was conducted like in a classroom or was it conducted on a one to one basis.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, one to one</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: It was one to one <span class="page-break" number="156"></span> Insdg http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well each, each questionnaire was, it was a separate investigation. A separate, a separate procedure for each individual.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see, and what was the procedure.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The procedure was to evaluate their questionnaire and to come up with a rating and there were five categories. You know. you know those five categories. Number one is mandatory removal. Number 2 is discretionary adverse recommendation. Number 3 is discretionary no recommendation. Number 4 is no evidence of anti, no evidence of Nazi activity. And number 5 was evidence of anti-Nazi activity.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Isee.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And so each individual would get a rating that would be the conclusion and then if they were in the 4 or 5 they would be removed from office or un, not hired and their bank account would be frozen and their property could be seized and used by the allies, by the Americans for you know like homes could be used for troops.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah and how long did such a process take.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: The evaluation process.</p><p>Q3 Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Just, just. It was I don't' know. I would say anywhere from an hour to a couple of days.</p><p>It depended on if there were any complications because we also had a special investigations unit that would look into difficult cases that were you know harder to figure out.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: right, right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You know they might go to interrogate some other people or try to get other records or whatever.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did you interview members of their family or I don't know</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Or friends or</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: We didn't necessarily interview them either. Most were, the action in most cases was taken on the basis of the questionnaire alone. We would bring them in for interviews if we had questions.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see. Oh you mean you got the fragebogen that you evaluated, but you didn't necessarily have the individual in front of you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: that's right. <span class="page-break" number="157"></span> Insdg http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I see. I didn't realize that. Now I suppose I had a different concept somewhat. I thought that after you went through the fragebogen and you decided who was suspicious or wasn't suspicious, that they somehow got some kind of a I don't' want to call it brain washing, but some kind of a you know democratic viewpoint or, or</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh no, no it was strictly</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Based on their fragebogen.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah it was strictly screening. No attempt to change them. or, or argue with them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And were they cooperative. Were they hostile, antagonistic or</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well I would say the main attitude was to try to get out of it. you know to say that they were innocent. You know nicht Nazi, Nicht Nazi was, was their motto. There was</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That was easy to say.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: There was one case I remember where this man said that he understands that the tables are turned and he had his days of glory and now his side had lost and he's prepared to take the consequences. And he you know he said well we had our day and now you have your day. Well that was very unusual.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: To admit that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: To do that. Most of them were made excuses. You know and they said they were forced and that they were not really a Nazi and so on. And of course the people from, who came from east Germany there was no way to check.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: That's the other big problem in Nazi mind. So I was, one of the questions I had in my mind was, was there any material use during this process. But I guess it wasn't cause I had a different concept of it at all. You know I thought there were lectures being given on democracy or lectures</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh no. there was not attempt to change anybody. It was completely screening.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And at the least suspicious back into the work force.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: To what</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I said and then to get the least suspicious individuals back into the working force.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah well to allow them to continue in their jobs. Or to be hired.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I understand, yeah. Ok let's see now. What qualifications did you have or were required in order to be part of this process. <span class="page-break" number="158"></span> Insdg http://collections.ushmm.org</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well I was a college student. I was a psychology major and I also had experience working in personnel administration. So I had administrative experience.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see. And were you in charge of this particular program.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: yes I was well, I was an enlisted man. I was a ser, a sergeant. The person in charge of the whole thing was an officer. A captain. And he and there was also a lieutenant. So I remember there were 2 American officers that were in charge, but the day to day work was done by the day to day work of being in charge, I mean, was done by an enlisted man. And my predecessor was the one who was being discharged. He was also a Jewish guy from the states. And I was put in to learn, learn the ropes. And learn the job. That he did. Heading up the staff. Supervising the staff.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see, so you were in a supervisory position.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes. The title was chief clerk</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Good, very good. Were the Germans that participated under oath. When I say those who sent out the fragebogen and was there anywhere where they had to I don't know sign that like we say here in the United States.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I think, I think they signed it, they had, when they signed it, it said it, I think it probably said in there that something about</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But they were not on any verbal oath or anything like that.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I think they got away with too much. Well that was another question had. How could you be sure that what they put down in their fragebogen was an honest answer, but I think you answered that already. And you could check it unless they came from the east.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah well. That's of course a big problem but and that I guess wasn't really eliminated until the 90s right when they got records. What did you hope to achieve with this de- Nazification program.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Cleansing. Well to keep the new Germany, the new German government more democratic. And, and not, not back in the hands of the Nazis.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And do you think you succeeded.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: We succeeded in, in our job. We understand that the new German government kind of weakened and we had heard that Nazis were being kept or hired again. <span class="page-break" number="159"></span> Insdg http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And that was under Adenauer or</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Well I guess you were dealing here with what 52 million people or however many</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. so you told me already where you were located right. And in Regensburg or where was it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Regensburg.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And that's where your work was located, in that part of Bavaria.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How long did you work in this capacity.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was there from September of 45 to May of 46.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: At the time that was in a DP camp in Italy.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Well beyond that even and so August I guess of 46. Ok. What are some of the most memorable incidents that you remember from that period. You already told me about the guy who said you had your day. I mean we had our day, now you have your day. I'm sure you came across a number of other memorable incidents with these people.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well I think one was when the statistics came out to show that we had the highest number of removals in the whole US zone.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: The highest removal. Yeah</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: The highest number.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well Bavaria is sort of Hitler country, perhaps that's why. Munich that's part of it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Also we had heard that the British were sitting and having tea with the Nazis and that the French I don't know, the French were either a very vengeful or just didn't care but that the United States forces were the most serious about de Nazification so we were proud that we were doing a good job.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Ok but specifically on a one to one from an individual did you have any memorable incidents. That occurred with you know you speaking to any of these people or in conversation or <span class="page-break" number="160"></span> Insdg http://collections.ushmm.org</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't remember any specific.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see. Now you think that the program was effective.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well it was effective while we were doing it but it was overturned. You know it was watered down and then it was done away with.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: How soon would you think was it watered down. I think that really is also important point because was there already a new younger generation coming in or</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No it was not while we were there. it was after. We heard that it was done afterward.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>Probably in late 46.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What that they overturned this program.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's what I heard.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Unh hunh. Well any other highlights that you remember during this period. I mean some really heavy duty Nazis that were discovered in this way. I assume that perhaps through the fragebogen you did discover some</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Anybody specific</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No I can't remember it. any big, big name.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah I mean really big shots.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No I don't think so.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What about how was it justified that some of the Nazis signed this et cetera, ended up here.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh I don't know. I don't know anything about that. I guess United States needed them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Or they would have fallen into the hands of the, of the other side.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you think, now let me ask you this. what are some of the strengths or weaknesses of this program.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well I think the weakness was not, not having record centers, not having records on people who came from other areas. <span class="page-break" number="161"></span> Insdg http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You're right, right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Other than that I think it was done very well. You know and was serious. People were removed and gradually jobs were, were given to people who were not Nazis. There weren't many there weren't many around you know. there was practically everybody was in the Nazi party because of the mandatory membership. From 37 on.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Not that I realize and that's of course very difficult to make this distinction. And then to be sure that yeah, really difficult. Did you were you able to obtain lists of Nazi party members.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: If I recall there was one time when somebody uncovered a record or a list of, of members that we could check against, against our applicants. It was kind of a surprise treasure that was uncovered.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I can imagine yeah. and probably to the great disappointment of some of the people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: there you have it black on white.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I had a question of how were the candidates for de Nazification chosen.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was a routine thing on their job. It was because of what, what poss, I guess to. I guess it was you know everybody in certain jobs in the government or in important positions in the society.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: that you really needed in order to</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: We didn't, we didn't' select them. they were we received, we received them. Somebody else selected them.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Made the selection. Now when you say somebody else, you mean from among the allies, not from within the Germans themselves.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I guess so. I don't, I don't' really know. it might be that an order went in from military government that everybody in a certain industry had to submit a fragebogen.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Isee. So really everything all the, all the selection and I hate to use that word for obvious reasons, but let's just use it for lack of a better word. So all the selections were really based entirely on the fragebogen.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: On the all the selections.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah who was going to be de Nazified or not <span class="page-break" number="162"></span> Insdg http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh. Well it started with the fragebogen and then if there were questions or suspicions then, then there would be interviews, and further investigations.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you do all the interviews yourself as well.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Did what</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did you do personally some of the interviews yourself or</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No we had an American GI originally from Germany who was a special investigator and he would, he would do them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: He would do the</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: The interviews. And he would look into and he would do further investigation.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see so it really was a whole teamwork.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yeah, absolutely.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now the work load must have been overwhelming. As you said before, you're dealing with a whole nation.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well we only had one state.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: now this, that's a good answer because that brings me to another question. Did you, did the United States have such programs all over Germany.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. Yes it was the whole US zone was divided into areas and all of them had the same kind of thing we did.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Isee, I see</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And we were just one, we were just in one state.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The Niederbier yeah. I see so this really was a well-organized undertaking.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I mean so what would you say roughly. How many people in your sector or in your section were involved in this. Germans I mean</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh the population.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I, don't know. A million, I don't know. I don't remember. <span class="page-break" number="163"></span> Insdg http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Well it was a vast undertaking. When you talk about the Americans having done that.</p><p>And I was not aware of that either, that this was not an allied undertaking. I always was under the impression that this was a cooperative undertaking.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: NO this was American. And the others had their own systems.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did they also call it de Nazification</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I don't' think so. I don't' know what they had. I mean we had heard that the British were having tea with the Nazis and the French were just wrecking their stores and homes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So nota</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh and the Russians were terrible you know. Everybody ran away from the Russians and said that they were monsters. They were so vengeful at the destruction that the Germans did of Russia.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well and also a lot of Russians died because of that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So let me ask you this. What would you say how did this experience affect you as a young person, in such a responsible position you know which involved really impacting the course of people's lives. Were you aware of your power. Were you troubled by the fact that you did not have experience in that area.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, actually I think it matured me. I enjoyed it. we lived well. I mean we had a hotel room.

I had a question whether you had to follow a protocol in this process or whether it was you know partially your own instinct to realize who was honest, who was not honest, et cetera. What guided your work more, the protocol that you had to follow or the instinct that you felt when confronting some of these fragebogen.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Probably both. You know for instance if there was a contradictions in dates or functions.</p><p>See I didn't, I wasn't an evaluator myself. I was a head of the unit so the evaluator would come to me with a question. They would say here is, here is this fragebogen where this guy answers this on this place in that and that place and it looks like a contradiction and so on. so they would come to me with questions.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: By the way I wanted to ask you. kind of a far out question. <span class="page-break" number="167"></span> Insdg http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yes, ok.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I have written a novel based on my experience there. it's called the Finishing Touch and it's about de-Nazification. And it has a love story woven in and out of it. but you know it's about an American who falls in love with a German woman and the German woman has two brothers. One of whom was a notorious Nazi and the and one died. And the one who was the Nazi took, takes on the identity of the one who died and tries to pass as the one who died. And so there is this intrigue about who which, which brother is this and trying to trace and find out and so on, so. It's a suspense novel. And I would like to find a publisher or an agent for it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: oh my goodness. Sounds really very intriguing. You did that in recent years.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I just wrote it. I just finished it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: how lovely. Well that's really a quite an undertaking.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well that's always very, very difficult to find a publisher but I suppose you could approach a number of you know known publishers and send them the manuscript.. I guess that's how you go about it. or you can go through some of the universities publish books. But I don't' know whether you know, as a novel, but it's really a historic novel I assume.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah it's a historical novel. It tells all about these kind of things that we talked about.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So possibly some of the universities might be interested. I mean you have to start somewhere and usually you know one person gives you an idea and another person and eventually you may find somebody who does, sounds fascinating to me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well it's related to the Holocaust Museum. That's why I asked you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, yeah right. well we don't' do any publishing. We have a book store that sells you know novels and mostly authentic stories about the Holocaust. And but these are all published book but we do not, we in the museum do not publish books.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So that's not very, no I excuse me. I remember as a teenager hearing about this, papers were full of this de-Nazification, de-Nazification but I don't think that we ever had really a concept of what that really involved. I think that perhaps maybe only in my own mind, I thought that it really was kind of a how shall I say it, yeah a curriculum that's probably the right way.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh unh hunh.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No it was never, It was never like that. it was political screening. Cleansing of job holding.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And then you have the scientists that they needed</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What were the dynamics between your team members.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: No I said the dynamic between your team members, among themselves, the 35 or whatever, yeah, especially in view of the , of what you just told me that there were DP people and there were Germans and then there was the army so how did all that work.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was every, it was fine. I mean everybody worked together and everybody was changing, everybody got along. Everybody had stories to tell about their own hardships.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Well that I would believe yeah. You remember some of those stories among those hardships that people</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well you know as I said a couple, a couple were in concentration camps. Some you know had to leave their homes and travel, escape, were in hiding. For many years. No I, as I recall everybody got along fine. There were no frictions.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Even among the people who were in a concentration camp and the Germans that they were</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well the Germans on our staff were anti-Nazi. <span class="page-break" number="171"></span> Insdg http://collections.ushmm.org</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well I guess maybe they were all out to do the same thing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah exactly. No we were all doing an important job. We realized that and it was, it was Nazi hunting. And you know somebody would find a fragebogen that would have contradiction in it or show something or, or some, something would come up from the record center, showing that somebody that we had screened turned out to be an important Nazi office holder. They would come into my office and, and hold it up like a victory.</p></p></dialogue>

They had, they had the were American immigrants. They came from Russia and they came a lot earlier so they were not affected by what was going on in Germany with Hitler. But everybody of course was very involved and very interested in, and cared a lot about what was happening in Germany.
