<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: As I was growing up there was anti-Semitism growing in Poland, beginning around 1934, and it was particularly evident at universities, and -- because Jewish students were not -- were told to sit in back benches and were not allowed sometimes to -- to even attempt classes [indecipherable].

N -- N.D. stands for National Democracy which is -- was the sort of right wing party, which was very anti-Semitic, and they sometimes would make -- not pogroms in the sense that somebody was completely bludgeoned to death, but they would beat up J-Jews in the street occasionally. And I learned to avoid big gangs of students, and -- and sometimes there were just stupid people who were anti-Semitic, but most of the people in the city were very well integrated because the -- the city itself had been under Austrian occupation and had a lot of Jew -- 30 percent of the residents were Jews, and -- and in addition Polish Catholics, there were Greek Orthodox, and there were Ukrainians and there were Armenians, so it was kind of cosmopolitan [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And did you notice that that was because there was a kind of division, or you think it was just happenstance?</p></p></dialogue>

So we finally made our way to a little town which was south, close to the Romanian border, and my parents must have thought already about going to Romania, but I wasn't quite --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You weren't quite aware of that.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- quite aware of that.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And do you remember people saying to you, why are you leaving? I mean, this is -- the people thought this would be --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- a kind of madness on your part.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- at that time, there were a lot of people who already had left western Poland, and for example, in our city, in Lwow, my mother's family had escaped from Krakow, which is more south central Poland, so people were all used to the notion that some people are leaving and going, and roads were full of people. And people were moving all over the place. And it was clear that the Germans were going to occupy all of Poland, yes. But in the end they didn't because they had the agreement with the Russians, which was at first a secret agreement, it was not known. So, when we got to [indecipherable] which is a town close to the border, we suddenly realized that the Polish government was evacuating.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you saw them evacuating.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We saw them.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Absolutely. And actually, we saw -- they were like buses which were -- had Polish gold on them, and the bank of Poland was evacuating the gold. And we saw foreign embassies evacuating, and -- and we saw the provincial governor with a horn, giving the orders or directions regulating the traffic and -- and saying now ministry of foreign affairs, and there would be a bunch of limousines going and there was a bridge and they would go across that bridge to Romania. So we saw the whole Polish government evacuating.</p><p>This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And we weren't sure we would be allowed to cross, because there were still both Polish border guards and Romanian border guards. And we didn't have a Romanian passport.</p><p>But on the 17" of September, the news came on the radio that the Russians had marched in, and many people thought that they were coming to help Poland, and -- attack Hitler, because nobody knew that Stalin and Hitler had a pact. And -- and there was a lot of discussion whether we should go back.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And my father thought that we should not go back and come back after we see the situation is quiet, peaceful and friendly. So we -- we decided to cross and -- and we basically -- my father had to bribe a Romanian guard to let us cross, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did you agree with that? Did you remember thinking about it?

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right. No, he left because he want to go back to his family and that was the deal with him before he drove us, that he would be able to go back and he was supposed to take the car back to the provincial governor, who wanted it, and so my uncle and aunt had passports, and had visas, so they were able to cross earlier, and we crossed later. And I had also a cousin, their son, who had his own car, and he drove his car with his girlfriend, and he had a passport and a visa, so he was able to cross earlier one.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So they had a visa to go -- get into Romania?</p></p></dialogue>

But -- and you know, he closed the flap over your head, and you're in a pretty closed environment and -- and I learned to drive a tank, I always say, before I learned to drive a car.

And I -- all the soldiers were given a declaration from England that -- from Britain -- from the British which said that we are encouraged to return to Poland and that they had the commitment that we would be safe when we came back to Poland, or since we had fought on the British side, if we didn't choose to go back to Poland, we could go to Great Britain.

And -- and I opted to go to the Polytechnic in Turin, Italy. A-And some others who want to study medicine went to Bologna, some others went to Rome, some went to Milan. So there were all these Polish young officer cadets, and young officers, who had matriculation and were ready to study and suddenly going to Italian universities and -- and in the -- in Turin there was a sort of dormitory for the Polish soldiers and - - who were studying, and I was in that dormitory.</p></p></dialogue>

And the British wanted to send all these people home.</p><p>And there were trains and the job in the camp was sorting people, finding out who they -- where they were from. And some of them didn't want to go back, in particular the Russians. Some of them were White Russians, who had collaborated with Germans, or who were afraid that they would be accused of having collaborated with German. So it was quite a messy scene and some of them were basically forced onto the trains and -- and also I saw Serbs being take -- Serbs were taken prisoners because they had fought together with the Germans, and they were being shipped back to Serbia. And -- some Serbs, anyway. And -- and -- and there were Polish people, which is why they needed Polish interpreter.

And we were trying to get a visa to come to the United States, and -- and actually, at one point I -- my aunt [indecipherable] was in her second marriage. In her first marriage, her married name was Ulam, and her nephew, son of her husband's dead -- the husband died, she was a widow before she remarried. And he was in the United States, his name was Stan Ulam. He was -- later became known for inventing the hydrogen bomb. But he was at University Southern California and he was a mathematician, an outstanding, world famous mathematician. And he also then went to New Mexico, or to -- to Los Alamos to participate in the development of the bomb. And he was well connected, and he got me an admission to the University of Southern California. So I went to the consulate in Genoa to see the American consul to pick up the visa, and the consul asked me, do you want to stay in the United States? And I said, of course. And it was absolutely the wrong answer, because the moment I said that, I couldn't get the student visa, because student visa is only for temporary stay as a student.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right, right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So the consul said, you have to apply for regular immigration visa. And Polish quota was very tight because at those ti -- in those days, each country had a quota, and since a lot of people from Poland were displaced, the Polish quota was very difficult to -- to get the immigration visa, and it was like a three year wait. So I didn't get the immigration visa til after I got to London. So my trip to Genoa was wasted, but my aunt finally send me the -- the papers to -- affidavit to -- to apply for the visa.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, are your -- your parents and sister trying to get to the United States at the same time?</p></p></dialogue>

And so my sister was already in Beirut, not with my parents, and I was in the army.</p><p>And the British then offered to evacuate Poles from Palestine. Just before they were going to leave Palestine, they evacuated Poles who wanted to leave, to Great Britain. And my parents communicate with my sister and she came and together they left from Palestine to -- to go to England, yeah. And I was already in England at that time.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And actually, the better student you were, the longer you could stay. So I stayed quite long in Italy to complete my first year of engineering, and then I had to leave.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And when I got to England, the British wanted to have better control over Polish soldiers in England so they put -- so they incorporated us into something called Polish resettlement corps.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Polish resettlement corps was a British unit for Polish soldiers. It was not to fight, it was just to control them.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And a lot of Poles ended up in coal mines, and -- because [indecipherable] Britain, so -- but I was one of those lucky ones who were given a -- an -- an -- an opportunity to go to London and study, and I started in something called Polish University College, which doesn't exist any more, but was preparing Polish former soldiers to take degr -- amer -- British degrees. And at that time University of London had a program which was called external program, so that you didn't have to attend the university, you could just take exams as an external student. And I couldn't get into any British university, they were all fully booked, so I went to this Polish University College, and I start preparing for what's called part one of the Bachelor's degree for the University of London external examination. And then -- and I took that examination and when I passed I transferred to Worcester Polytechnic, which was sort of a college, but again the exams were external University of London exams, and I was preparing for part two, and I was going through it pretty quickly so that by 1949, when I was 24, I was ready to take the Bachelor's degree exam, but then my visa arrived from the United States, and the American consul would not renew it. I wanted to wait til June, it was March, and he said he couldn't renew the visa, I would have to go to back of the line. So I went to the university office, and I asked them whether I could go and take the external examination in Canada, which was at that time a British -- part of British empire. And the -- well, I said even maybe should come back to London because be it'd be cheaper than taking a whole year of study.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was mostly in -- I became a specialist in communication theory and signal processing and I first worked on development of radar and then on development of visual communications or radio communications in particular. And I first worked at Lincoln Laboratory, and then I worked at RCA and then I started my own company.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How -- how did you happen to narrow the field? I -- I'm assuming this is -- is part of the field of electrical engineering, am I right?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Correct, yes.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see. When -- when you look back on your life, do you see that your experiences had an important influence on how you lived your life after the war?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Definitely, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: An-And how would you characterize that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, first of all, having served in the military and having had ups and downs in my own life, I learned that money is very valuable, but that you really -- well, it's more important that you feel good and do the right thing. And -- and I learned to respect people in every walk of life. And -- and sometimes I found different people helped me in different situations and some of them were not my buddies, and -- and also I learned to not give up easily and to have faith that I can get out of a situation, and if it was difficult for example, in business, I learned to persist and -- and try to find a way to solve problems. And I kind of got -- I get very challenged to -- when I'm in adversity, to deal with it. And I think I've taught my children that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And how do you relate that to the -- do you think -- well, I don't know how -- whether you can even answer this question. Had you not escaped, had your not -- not -- your parents shown</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And my mother at one point became depressed and I felt s-so miserable about it, and saw her so miserable that I decided --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: That you wouldn't. [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I will not let myself become depressed, under any circumstances. And I -- I -- I kind of sometimes welcomed the challenge.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And I understand that you are very involved in Polish Jewish relations and involved with those Poles with -- who were not Jewish necessarily, who went though similar experiences to you. [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: That's right. I -- I -- I feel that the people who went through it, we really had all very good relations. Now, this was not true of survivors, some of whom are very bitter that some their friends denounced them. And on the other hand there are people who survived who were saved by Poles. It was almost impossible to survive without some assistance from somebody. But I'm interested in seeing Polish Jewish relations become normal, and -- and this is impossible unless you participate and try to do it, y-you can't just say I won't have anything to do with these people and hope that relations can become normalized. And I believe it's important that people get along no matter what nationality they are, and what ethnic group they are and what religion they are.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And do you see improvements in the relationship of Polish Jews and Polish Gentiles?</p></p></dialogue>

Jews who are 10 percent of Poland. And I think some of it has been the German propaganda that sort of separated Jews into umensch, which means, not a man, inhumans basically.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And -- and also Soviet propaganda which was against Palestine, and against Zionism, and -- and some of this is the Soviet and German inf -- a-and, you know, the Germans have become democratic country now, and -- and Communism is dead and some of it is disappearing in Poland, but there is still, particularly among people who are deprived, who look to be either better than somebody, or to be mean to somebody and compensate for their depravation, no matter whether the person is guilty of their depravation or not. And some of these people are still sort of anti-Semitic --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- but the more intelligent people are not, I don't think. And so I am active in -- in -- both in trying to document Polish Jewish history and in Polish Jewish relations.</p></p></dialogue>

And we have done a lot of family traveling, yeah. We went to Poland and actually to Ukraine with the children, so -- in 1989, when the Iron Curtain dropped. I had been afraid to go to Poland before I retired because I was working in defense industry, but then after I retired and Gorbachev came to power or something, we decided to go and visit Lwow.</p></p></dialogue>
