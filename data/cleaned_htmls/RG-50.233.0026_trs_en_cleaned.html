I run away. I run away. Hey, it was over ---. I wanted to be shot because when they're shooting you, it's over. But this way, you keep[ always sweating, always sweating from frightening. Might as well --. Anyway when I come back to the ghetto, I didn't went into the ghetto. I sended in a guy to tell to my wife, I'm over here.</p><p> She already knew. You know why, because when she come to the gemeinde, to the hierach from the Jews where they're giving out a loaf of bread, they told them the Warsaw bird already run away. After this, they send me away to M , another camp. It was a small camp, just how to say to take it out the youth. That the city shall be less Jews. Treblinka was not ready yet, not ready, how to say, to__, to destroy the people. It was still building the crematoriums.</p><p>They keep over there, it was over there a couple hundred Jewish people, women, men. Then when they liquidated, they come back to the city. When I come back, I was always frightened from the police. I was sitting, I give you a sample in the house and I was doing some tailoring because the farmers, when I fixed them a pair of pants or I made them something, they used to bring me a loaf of bread, a bag of potatoes, a chicken. Because I didn't need no money. The only thing what I need is just to survive. When the police saw me, I'm sitting in the window, they used to run. In Europe, a cellar is not like in America. In Europe a cellar is just like in the kitchen. A hole and its big boards. It was a deck, like a door. For the winter used to store potatoes or something. What I did, in the bedroom, I used to rip it up a couple of bolts and make over there another hole, lift it up, it was not a mattress like a shan __, lifted up this and let myself in. When they come in the house, they said, I just saw him in the window, where is he?</p><p>Where did they look, I disappeared. So they were looking there and went away. I had a couple hours work to do. In the meantime, when the farmer come, he brought me the -- several potatoes or anything, I had something to eat. When it was very bad, I had to hide somewhere in an attic. My wife used to -- she had an aunt over there, Mimi Lia, she used to cook up something and bring me up the attic because they were looking to send away people and I was hiding out. It was so bad, it was already m__ Yom Kippur, the end of Yom Kippur. Already they was taking people, sixty year old, was not youth, in Wegrow.</p></p></dialogue>

The less Jews were gathering in a barn. They're crying and begging to God, they're praying. If such a thing exists, the skies would split from the tears. We come back, in the night. The Germans went around, you know what ludens are, shadows. With the bietnam, in the shadows, Juden roust, Juden roust, you know what I mean. In the morning, they had to market all the Jews what was survived already. Old people, I was between the youngest because they couldn't do nothing with me. They loaded them in horse and wagon and they shipped -- they drove them up to Treblinka. I was still there. Me and my wife, we was hiding in this hole what I had beside the cellar under the bed. What I did, I opened up the door from the cellar and show to him, who will come in, the door was open, how it was already clean, no Juden. Because that time already. The Jews knew they made double walls, they climbed in, in the chimneys to hide; they hide in the attics. It was outside the toilets. A lot let themselves in the shit up to the chest, just to breathe, just to breathe. Over there in a small city, they had cows, they had chicken. The cows were without food, without a thing, were making moo, you know. When I, in the morning had got gray, I looked through the window. I saw a cat passing by. I said look, how lucky, they're not going to shoot the cat but if I stick out my neck and somebody saw it, bingo, I get a bullet in my neck. But it got a little lighter, I went down back to the hole. The Germans come in, in the house. I heard them. They were shooting in the walls because a lot of Jews had double walls, they were hiding in the walls. But a lot of Jews made mistakes, they took it in the walls, a clock. When you come in, in the house you can hear aclock. They looking for the banger from the clock. A lot of Jews they found between the double walls. They took them out and they took them to the cemetery. They had to dig their own graves, they shot them.
