And he met this young girl in the convent, they fell in love and she ran away and they got married, and they had five children. And they lived in the small town called Avesano which unfortunately was</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="0"></span> </p><p> destroyed by earthquake, so my father lost all his family in this earthquake. And also his grandmother was Catholic, but she had decided to bring her children, the boys in the Jewish faith and the girls in the Catholic faith.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you look very Jewish?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, I don't think Ido. Do I?

No. No. In fact, all my relatives, after we found each other, they used to tell me "Could you go to my house, you know, and get me this and get me that?" And I would go and not realizing, you know, how dangerous it was because nobody would think that I was Jewish.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What kind of papers did you have when -- at that point when you were 18 ?</p></p></dialogue>

He just corrected mine.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, he changed the "n" to an "m"?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They didn't ask for religion.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. So he changed that. And then what did you do? Where did you go?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: So meanwhile, my father was trying to find us a place. And, you know, I told you he was in the lumber business, so he got in the construction of many buildings. And he called up one of his friend who was an architect, and he didn't have to explain much; he understood right away. And he said that he would, you know, find a place for us. They had just built this place near the University of Rome for women coming out of town, you know, and attending the universities. And there was brand-new building still there.</p><p>I don't know if you've ever been in Rome --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Like a dormitory, you mean?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes, like a hostel, you know, for -- And the Mother Superior said yes, she had already hidden other people for political or racial or so.

And</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="12"></span> </p><p> meanwhile my sister had been sent out of the house of our cousins; they didn't keep her, yes, SO --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Because they felt it wasn't safe?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, it wasn't safe because, you know, they put posters all over Rome that, you know, whoever would shelter Jews would be sentenced, so --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: These were posters on the street?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, yes. So they got very scared, and they sent her out, and my sister was very upset, of course.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And she was far along in her pregnancy?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Four months pregnant, yes. So she came with me to the convent.

You know, we had to go to sing, the prayers, you know, and everything.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was this familiar to you? Were these rituals and ceremonies familiar to you since you had Catholic relatives?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Ina way, yes, you know, we were familiar. But we had to learn all their prayers, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did you feel about that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I felt that I was praying my God. I felt so much that I needed pray that I didn't care if I was in the church or in the synagogue. They have, you know, the confessional, you know, was very comforting to me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you and your sister were together, she was four months pregnant and you went to this dormitory, you said?</p></p></dialogue>

And they put in it -- in the apartment people who had come from the south of Italy. You know, during the occupation of the Americans some of the Italian Fascists, you know, ran north -- or antiFascists, I should say, ran north. And so we had to give the apartment, you know, to them, because the way they continue the war, the raids, they couldn't live in Naples or in other country of the south.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And what did you do during the day?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, during the day we could have -- you know, go anywhere because the curfew was at 6:00.

And then I got into -- you know, get in touch with some of the partisans; already, you know, they were formed. So I belonged to some kind of organization that was called a Christian, you know, for freedom, something like that. And we used to ask each other, bring news from one place to another and see that everybody would be sheltered, they would need food, things like that.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="14"></span> </p></p></dialogue>

So we knew that they would come, but we didn't know what would happen at that point. So that night, you know, I called my mother and my father, and it was too far away to walk then. There was no transportation at that point; there were only, you know, Germans going out, you know, like a war in the city, impossible to walk. So I called my mother and my father, and I say, "What should I do?" Do you think you should try to go to your sister, maybe you would stay; you know, they live in an apartment, should be safe. So I went there, and I asked if I could stay, you know, at least overnight because maybe during the night, they would decide what to do, you know, the -- if -- stay in Rome and -- you know, and fight or just go through. We didn't know. But I was not wanted there. They said that they didn't have enough food and it would be very dangerous, you know, I was young and attractive, maybe, you know, some Germans would come in the house and follow me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>So it was near the curfew; it was 6:00, and I had to go out, much regret of my sister, but there was nothing I could do about. And so I went, and that was a very terrible experience because that was the end of the war; you know, you could see the defeat in the soldiers" face. They were drunk; they were bleeding all over. You know, and I run, you know. I stopped somebody, and I said, "Please take me." You know, where I say  <span class="page-break" number="21"></span> </p><p> please, please don't bother me, just to reach my house. I have to do it by myself. And finally, you know, I reached the convent, and I collapsed on the ground, but the nuns came out, you know, and they took me inside. And I decide that I didn't want to sleep alone, so I had these two very dear friends; they were two old Jewish lady, and they were so nice to me. And they say stay in our room, and I stayed and I spent the night there. And, finally, you know, when I woke up in the morning, I could not believe it that when we look out the window, we saw soldiers that they didn't look like Germans; in fact, they were the Americans.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In what way?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, first of all, I told you about the school that, you know, I feel the lack, you know, of education. I wish I could have continue which I did. Later on I went to Queens College, and I continue. My brother-in-law is the head of the Department -- Italian Department, Queens College. Maybe you have read his book, Sergio Pacifici.</p><p>He has written many literature books, so he -- after my husband died, he advised me to continue college to be able to teach Italian. But unfortunately, I was unable. I had four children, you know, and lost -- already engaged, you know, and there were in university.</p><p>And I had a very little one; after 14 years, I had a little boy, Robert, who is now 30 years old. So I had to follow him; it was too much for me to continue. So that influenced a lot because, you know, my education. Besides that, you know, I had -- I became more religious, I would say, ever. You know, I don't go much to synagogue or things like that, but my feelings are so deep now, I feel that I've been so honored to talk about what happened to me because I have nightmares, still have nightmares, you know, of what happened to -- especially to my cousin Julia who, you know, died with a husband and two small children, Carla and Needa (ph); they were only five and three years old. And I constantly pray for them, you know. And this kept me, you know, in my faith. All sisters tried to convert me; I would never, never, never, never, never. And that's very</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="24"></span> </p><p> important to me. My family now, they're all married. My young one is married to a Korean, but he got married in the Jewish faith. My other son is married to an Irish, but he has kept his faith. My other sons, you know, he kept his faith. And also if we don't show, I hope that I have, you know, taught this to my children that, you know, how important it is. I don't care what's, you know, they're outside going to synagogue or serving, what the faith will be, and that's very important. Also, you know, I appreciate the fact that this brought me to live in this country. I go often to Italy, but I could not live there anymore. I feel that this country gives the opportunity, you know, to keep your faith, to work. I didn't have any education, but I was able always to support myself. My husband didn't leave me rich, but I was able, you know, to have all my children have their degree and their professions. And I could never have accomplished if I had stayed in Italy. I myself, you know, I decided office work wasn't for me, and I took care of my catering and my chef work, and I been very successful. So thank God for America.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Why?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because they have not been, you know, so unaware what's going on in this world.</p><p>They have to be prepared. We were not. They came with gun, and we just went, like sheep. That wasn't the way to do it. We should have been active. And when they say now in Israel, you know, they are too -- you know, too war-minded, things like that, I approve because, you know, we have to defend ourselves. We were -- You know, we just went; we were too innocent about it, so I want my children to be very aware of this.</p></p></dialogue>

How is this possible?" Yes, there were Jews in Italy, and we went through exactly what everybody else in Germany and Poland that they -- you know. They were very brave, and there were very many important people; their culture was, you know, high, extended and the world should know, yes, there were Jews in Italy. That's very important.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Any other thoughts that you --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I think that I'm very lucky to be here. It's like a dream, and it's like a miracle.
