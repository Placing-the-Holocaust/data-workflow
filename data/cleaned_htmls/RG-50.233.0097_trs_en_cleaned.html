The ghetto, I think, was established in the first month, I don't remember the exact month, sometimes around April of 1940. The ghetto boundaries were already established and the Jews were encouraged to move there. Nobody was moving. At that time, the Russians had deported or repatriated rather, the German population from Latvia, from Volhynia, from the parts of Poland, in particle, they were mostly by Germans, in the states which Russia occupied after 1939 and they were given the choice of Jewish apartments as we lived in the nice section of town where one of the parents were to go. Two German officials came and told us we had one hour and we could take whatever we could carry plus F (couldn't hear) to go, so we went. We were able to get a room in one of the two or three homes which had modern conveniences like water, flush toilets and so forth. The ghetto to which they press around 150,000 -- 160,000 Jews, was occupied before probably by 10,000 -- 15,000 people and that was the worst slums by looting. There were very few buildings <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection was left with my mother. Things got even worse as far as the food was concerned. But yet the younger people organize themselves, called Self-Help Organization. The morale was, well, we still felt that we had a chance to survive. This had changed in 1942. In 1942, the runcoston had a assembly. It's 92, 50 years before and I still remember. He said to us, he stand before us as broken man, that he devoted all of his later years to helping orphans, he organized orphanages even un ghetto and he tried to give him as much resources to survive as he could and yet he was ordered by the Germans that he was to deliver 24,000 Jews. Jews over 60 years old and children under 10. He told us, you have a choice. Our police would take them and it would be dark in semi-orderly fashion or the Germans would come and take them and it would be much worse. If we want to survive, the 100,000 Jews which at the point were locked up in the ghetto want to survive, they have to give up 20,000. Well, the chorus arise, no, no, we all go. And if the reaction was the people concerned to this, it was emphatically, no. Yet, they declare curfew and nobody was allowed out of their homes and the Jewish police went from house to house and there were some doctors among them and they make the selections. All the sickly people and the older people and the children were taken away. But what the Jewish police did was not good enough for Germans and they came. Some people were shot. They tore the children from the mothers" arms. They beat the people. The mothers who resisted were shot on the spot. In most cases, the women remained frozen when the Germans took the children away. Only when the child was already on the horse drawn wagon, they realize what happen, they start to chase and cry. Well, they took the 20,000, 25,000 people. And from then on, almost every able -bodied man or woman or teenager or this, had to work. The food supply didn't improve -- deteriorate, more and more. There was a lot of mismanagement, in ghetto.</p><p>He tried Rumkoski tried to store some of the potatoes, you know, which were supposed to be rationed to the population. And the whole thing, the entire crop got spoiled. In 1942, I think, 1943, the Germans appointed Gertler, who was one of the collaborators in trying to extract as much valuables and this from the Jews, from the Germans, he appointed him head of the so called sondokommando. He tried to bring some order to the ghetto. In a way he did. He made the thing look a little more efficient. In the meanwhile, more and more, the demand for more were given and people were left in apartments. 3,000, 5,000, 10,000 and when</p><p> you walk the streets of the ghetto 1943, 1944 you saw, they used to call mussermench, because the people pattern of working and bending looked like a praying Muslim. The people became living skeleton, some of them were swollen, some of them looked like skeletons and you could see a good part of the population was so emaciated that the war is not going to end soon, they are going to die. Well, the ghetto lived until 1944.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What were you doing this whole time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was working. I was working in the office of a sort of a shop getting my rations. In 1943, my mother died of starvation. She lost weight progressively and finally she was not able to walk any more. She stayed in bed constantly. (very low -- can't hear). <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection they will be better fed and so forth but nobody trusted him. People tried to avoid deportation as long as they could. I left Lodz in August 23"! 1944. We didn't know where we go. Probably if we would know where we go and what Auschwitz is, we would get vicious to board the trains and probably shot, but that would be at least passive resistance but we really didn't know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Had you heard about the camps at that point?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Lodz ghetto was the most isolated ghetto in Poland. Every hundred feet you get a German guard. We didn't get no papers, nothing. Supposedly, few survivors from Chedno were able to escape but the population didn't know. We knew that clothes came back to the ghetto from the people who were deported, the old and the sick people and people had foreboding that nothing good comes and they probably perish but they didn't know that systematic extermination and this. Well, we boarded the train. There was hundred people in a cattle car in which we were transported. We went for about three or four days.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can I stop you? I want to flip the tape over.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> (END OF SIDE A)</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: All right. So, when we boarded the train, there were 100 people in our, whatever you call this, and what they gave us, there was one bucket which was supposed to serve if people wanted to relieve themselves. There was no water. A little bit of food we took with. I think it took us about four days out to reach Auschwitz. We came at night. We were allowed to take hand baggage. When the doors opened, we saw people pointing to us looked like a fine striped pajamas uniforms. But they spoke to us Polish and told us, "please leave all the things inside the car. Just get out, get out, get out." Before we could do anything else, we form a line, we saw a lot of SS running with the pistols and with guns, whipping people and we were marching top a well lighted platform and Mengele was standing there and conducted the selection. And with a flip of the hand, some went to the right, some went to the left. We had no idea what it means. I went to the right. They took us, they took all the clothes away, they shave us completely and they give us the striped uniforms and a number and we were led to a barracks.</p><p>Barrack that were former quarters of Austrian cavalry from before WWI and when you slept over there you could lay down on one side but we were pressed so much that there was no place to turn around. I still have, 50 years, I have scars about size of half dollar because we were all bones at that time and laying and pressing, the bones were pressing against the wood and the things got infected. I was about two weeks -- I wasn't in Auschwitz, I was in Birkenau.</p><p>Birkenau was part of Auschwitz complex but there was, people didn't work over there. People were either sent to the gas chamber, either sent out to other German concentration camps at that time. You could see when we went to the barrack, the flames shooting and the block leader told us what it is, that the people from the selections are having appointment with their forefathers.</p><p>Well, anyway, I was there for two weeks and I was selected and put into a transport and I met one of my former classmates, Jerry Malikoff and we decided that we stick together. And we were, together, almost to the end of the war. We were deported to the commander of Dachau. That was a separate camps of Dachau. Dachau was much minor camp in comparison. . There were just camps in which the Jews worked until they <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection carry the dead bodies back because they have to count every day. We stood on the appell platz, that was the place where they counted the prisoners and the number of the prisoners had to tally, even if we stood late in the night. I was lucky for a short while to get the job . Then they used us to take care of other prisoners. When you are sick, when you get your slice of bread you couldn't eat everything and there was a lot of bread left. At that time, I gained some weight but after a while the Germans got tired of it and they took away with the transport all the sick people, the block was liquidated and we went back.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You weren't too sick to leave, you recovered?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's right. At that time, I got infected feet and I got blood poisoning and they took me and doctor , the physician was later -- he attended at our wedding. My wife went to nursing school and he was director of nursing school after the war. He attended our wedding He told me, you come son, I have to amputate or you die. And they didn't have no anesthetics and he told me "but look, you'll be in pain but you'll faint". And few people put me on the table, they help me and I just realize at that moment that they are going to take away the toes of my foot. They are going to amputate, I'll be sent away to the gas chambers. So with all the strength I have, I tore myself out and I run away. I run away and I went to the working detail.</p><p>At that time, I had no feeling in my foot and I must have stepped on a very sharp stone and it cut deeply but that saved me and the pus and everything started to drain. After the war I still had operation and I had pieces of bone taken out of my toes but I survived this.</p><p> When the Allies started to come in and they started to come in direction of Dachau from Ausborg, which was miles away, they put us all on the trains. Then they started to gather all the prisoners into the main camp in Dachau, although we were probably no more than twenty, thirty miles to Dachau, everything wass bombed, and I was in transit for about four or five days.</p><p>There was no water, there was no food. Some people went crazy and they drank their own urine. When my train came to Dachau, they unloaded boxcar. They unloaded my boxcar. That was the last boxcar they unloaded. There were more dead than alive and when the American army came two days later, they found the entire train, say the first five boxcars, boxcars full of dead prisoners. Well, and what the Americans done -- they put us. I was in the hospital for quite a few months and I decided to go back to Poland to see if anyone had survived. We had, during the war, when we knew that they are going to take our apartment away, that sooner or later we had to move to ghetto, we had neighbors. Their name was Mitchelene, they were Poles. He was, the father of the man was Italian and the mother was Polish but they lived in Poland and we knew them very, very well. As a matter of fact, the woman was carrying , my mother was carrying her . [knew the people for fourteen years, from the time I moved in the house to the time I was deported. My mother took all the crystals, all the china, all the silver up to them and said, "Look, I doubt if we will get alive from the ghetto. That's all yours." We survived. We didn't expect. Well, I went over there when I came. I went with the transport to Poland, Polish transport of course, repatriated to Poland, it was very easy to get on the train. I came over there, I went on the tenth floor. I knocked on the door. A woman opened the door and she tried to slam in my face. "We have nothing, we have nothing." I was just able to hold the door open and I said "look, I don't want nothing from you. I came from Auschwitz and I saw the silver and the money and the crystals all mingled with blood. All I want to know, did somebody from my family, my cousins, did survive, look for me". She said "nobody" and she slammed the door in my face. I was three days in Poland and didn't find nobody and went back. In the beginning, the liberated prisoners who were in Munich, which is twenty miles from Dachau but I north to Frankfort on Meine and opened and I enrolled .

I got married in 1948. My wife was in nursing school at that time. We came here. Well, my story is for all the people who came displaced persons, who came to this country. We worked for a couple of years and then I went back to school. I got my PhD from medical school from the University of Chicago and came to Washington, started with the government.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Amazing. Can I ask you one specific question that you made a reference earlier to that you went to summer camp as a child, was that a Zionist summer camp?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was school camp. Well, it was a Zionist, not be definition, it was Zionist by what permeated. I remember as children we made the campfires and we stood and we sang Hebrew Zionist songs, yes, yes. It was not a Zionist organized, but culturally it was a Zionist camp.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Thanks. Can we go on, would you mind talking a little bit about your mother now? Can we do that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, sure. My mother, like most of the women in the middle class, around a hundred middle class families, didn't work. She was active, she was active in Jewish life. She traveled. Asa matter of fact, my mother was in the United States attending the World Fair in 1939. She came to see her brothers. When she returned to Poland two weeks before the war started, her brother begged her to stay but you know, she said "look, I have a child and my husband over there." When she crossed Germany, the train was seeing, nobody could get, you know, she just transited into Germany, into Poland. If the war had broken out two weeks earlier, I would still have probably my mother alive. I remember in 1938, Germans expelled the Jews who were once Polish citizens. We were not at that far from the border. Lodz, I don't know, maybe two, three hundred miles from the border, from the western border in Germany. We kept a young boy and I shared the room for a while, I don't remember, for half a year.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: He came and lived with you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. The Jewish community took the children and then his parents came and took him away.</p><p>They got situated. The brothers of my mother tried to talk us into leaving Poland and coming to the States but my father was a metal agent at that time. We had , we were very, very financially comfortable and he felt, his reasoning was, I don't know the language, you can take no money out of Poland. You could just go as you were. What am I going to do over there?</p><p>And he didn't. He didn't want to go and they paid with their lives, my parents.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can we go back, do you know your mother's birth date by any chance? Anything, the town where she came from?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yes. My mother came -- just a second. Yes, my mother was about 23 when I was born so she was born probably around 1900. She lived in a small town in Lithuania, Batinia, Lithuania.</p><p>My grandfather was very well to do. He owned quite a bit of land. He owned a sawmill. He owned a flourmill ad my grandparents sent us packages in 1941 to the ghetto from Lithuania.</p><p>The packages reached the ghetto. They were killed -- the Lithuanians killed them even before the Germans. In the two to three days when the Russians pulled away and before the Germans occupied physically the town, the entire Jewish population was finished.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you know about your mother's education?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: My mother attended the university, in Russia . She was interned a year <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Languages.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What about the Jewish life in her home? Were they observant?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yes, oh yes. My mother's family certain was more, they were not Hasidic, but they were more observant. Entire generation, my grandparents were much more observant. My dad's father was much more observant than we were. But you have to understand one thing. My parents went through WW1. They lived already under the communist regime for a while, for a few years before they were able to extricate themselves from Russia. And probably just like today's generation of the people veer from the strict religious practices of their parents, they veer from the strict religious practices of their parents. In other words, the meat was kosher still at home but when we ate dinner, we could have coffee or tea with milk, you know. It was kosher but not in the strictest sense of this. We had two sets of dishes and so forth. I remember, I went for Rosh Hashonah and Yom Kippur with my dad to the synagogue.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: For Shabbat, you would work on Shabbat?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, there were candles. There were candles at home but you took the streetcar. My father rode the car, he had a car which was in Poland, there were not too many cars but he had a car.</p><p>Shabbat was much more a tradition than a religious observance. We never went for Sabbath day and Friday services. The synagogue was quite a distance from where we lived and it was the only one big synagogue in Lodz. Our home was a Zionist home, much more than a religious home.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I understand. I was just asking. Can you tell me something more about your mother's personality? Anything you can remember?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: She was young and she was full of life. My mother played beautiful violin. She was not a concert violinist but I remember her playing for her friends and so forth. She got active with several of her friends. I've got a large family. All three sisters of my mother and they got children, they are my cousins. From the entire family, that's what I went to look for, I'm the only survivor. She had two brothers in this country. One of them, we took the name of my uncle in L.A.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: He sponsored you to come here?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, but when we came here, it is hard to explain. The only thing what we were able to salvage from the old country was the . Iremember we came to Chicago and I already got <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection time it helped. But what we did, we did on our own. We pulled ourselves up.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Have you tried to find out about family members?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I wrote them a letter. | remember my father-in-law was a very, very bitter man. He never reconciled himself to what happened. He just could not reconcile that people have wives, family and this, you know, and his wife perish and his mother perish. I was younger, but we were also bitter at that time. We're not bitter at nobody in particular. I wrote them a letter and I said "look, I'm at the university, I'm studying, I'm not asking for nothing, I don't need nothing but you are entitled to know what happened to your family." And I wrote it. And the answer was "Look you never asked us for nothing, we didn't refuse you nothing." They couldn't understand probably , why the letters were so bitter. When I came here, you see this is the difference probably between the immigration, between the displaced persons who came here at that time. We spent very little, just wanted a chance. Russian Jews, and I quite active now with Russian Jews, they expect much more. They expect much from society. We were so disillusioned, that we didn't expect nothing from nobody. But, yes, I have contact with them, but I lived in Chicago, they lived in L.A. I saw them a few times. As a matter of fact when I got out from undergraduate school in Annapolis, his wife came to my graduation. My wife has a family in Chicago. They showed us when we came. They are not wealthy people but the children were pretty well off. They're professionals and we got quite close to them. We finally realized that they tried to be family to us and we integrated (couldn't hear) into the family.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you still have other cousins?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yeah, we still go to the weddings and Bar Mitzvahs and to this and that. Yes, these cousins</p><p> .
