And of course, I noticed the discrimination not from the children, but from the higher ups, immediate -- very, very -- very quickly. I was a pretty good soccer player, and was what you would call now a striker. And together with the center, whose name was Krempel(ph), I happen to remember his name, we scored a lot of goals. And one day my -- the coach came to me and said, you can no longer play on the line, I'm gonna put you in the goal, because you're not going to be playing in the interschool game, because you're Jewish. And then I played goal for a while, and then I was out altogether. And the other time I was very uncomfortable is, they taught religion in school. So couple times I went along with -- for -- with the Catholic class, because I'd -- I was embarrassed to drop out. And then th-the -- our synagogue, the [indecipherable] in German it's called liberale Gemeinde, a liberal exa -- which is what -- here -- here would be called Conservative. We were members of that, and the religion teacher, also the cantor, is Herr Kappel(ph) would come to the high school, to the gymnasium and with the two or three of us, would have a master key, and look for an empty classroom, and give us religious classes.

You know, this was a -- a doctor friend, if I remember correctly, who was put in a concentration camp because he was seen with a Christian woman. Now, they finally let him go, but he was pretty emaciated, and ill when he got out. Now absolutely, there were people arrested for all kinds of reasons, or -- or drummed up reasons. And some were let go, and some were not so fortunate. So the question of ca -- disappearing to c -- to concentration camps, that was already going around for quite a while.</p></p></dialogue>

You can argue this both ways, you could say look, your gra -- your grandparents did this, and so our -- some of your grandparents, and so you're still paying for what they did, just as -- as in this country some people are advocating restitution for the slaves.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It did. When we finally were invited back, I think that was the first time we went to Germany. No, we were there once before.

In other words, the people who were the children of the people who did some of these things, were t -- didn't want to talk about it. They were embarrassed, they were ashamed, and they wouldn't bring it up in school. The Holocaust simply wasn't discussed. And we, of course, resented that.</p></p></dialogue>

But when I learned something about biochemistry, and at that time was the time when it -- what was called [indecipherable] very, very much in the research area. In other words, how the body metabolizes food to create energy, to create growth.

And we made some interesting discoveries in that area. But I didn't stay in there.

Anyway, Louis Thomas approached me about coming to NYU and gave me a very nice position as assistant professor at NYU in department of medicine. He wanted me strictly -- I mean, I'm -- I'm a PhD, I'm not an MD, so the only thing I could do was research, and I got a teaching appointment in -- at that time spa -- microbiology, cause that's where my -- that's where I was with Werner Maas(ph). So I had an appointment for -- do research in medicine, and -- and -- and a teaching appointment in microbiology. And after I was there a fairly short period, maybe a year, I-- my -- my boss, Dr. Thomas came to me and said, the city of New York is setting up a -- something called the Research Council of New York. And one of the purposes, the main purpose of this organization is to give what they call career awards to young, promising scientists to keep them in the city. I'd like for you to apply, and if you do that, I'd like you to think about maybe -- even though I don't want you to give up what you're doing if you're so interested in it. But I'd like you to think about something you could do that might interest a city, that might make it easier for you to get the fellowship, the research career award.

I had to learn it -- all my [indecipherable] course I didn't learn as well as if I had formal courses. So it would have been good to have at le -- at least a more biological approach.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Questions that I wanted to follow up on and sort of like to tie up loose ends from the beginning. You've mentioned that when you were a young boy, and during one of the trips to Switzerland with your father, you stayed at a kosher hotel because you wanted to be a rabbi. And tell me, what was it about being a rabbi that attracted you? That -- that -- what appealed?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: That's a difficult question to answer, except I -- I was impressed with our rabbi, Rabbi Paul La-La-Lazarus(ph) in Wiesbaden who -- who spoke at my -- who -- who Bar Mitzvahed me essentially, taught me my lessons -- some of my Bar Mitzvah lessons and gave the -- the sermon, and he was a very good speaker, and I admired him a great deal.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: But I can't believe in it personally. I mean, I -- I can believe in a-- in a-- some kind of super power. I cannot believe in a personal God that would answer que -- prayers or punish you or reward you. Simply, the evidence is not there.
