We had, I think -- this, don't forget was -- I was born in "24, so we had a -- our -- our childhood were really quite happy. My parents were well off.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes, it -- it-- I mean -- and -- and my grandfather owned that apartment building, so my dad and my uncle owned -- owned the whole thing eventually.

Was there a courtyard?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Or even on the street, because there wasn't a whole lot of traffic. So this was my early childhood and the next major thing I remember, and we can go back if something comes up from a question, was when I was about six, seven years old, I developed on my left eye, I believe it was, a -- what looked like a -- a serious infection or some inflammation, where I had a drooping li-lid, and it looked very angry. And my parents took me to an eye doctor in Wiesbaden, of all -- of all names, Dr. Goering.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: But my parents got scared enough so they sent me for the entire -- when I was about seven years old, for the entire winter to a kinderheim, which I guess translates best to a chi-children's camp --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- in Samaden(ph), Switzerland, a village right outside of Saint Moritz.</p></p></dialogue>

Didn't really appreciate, as I did la-later on, as I will tell you in a minute. So I was there for a very long time, the idea was that the mountain air is good for TB.

<dialogue class=""><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Eric Simon 8 June 21, 2014</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I think there was some conversation about that they were very worried that Hitler might come to power. And I -- my dad had read "Mein Kampf." And I'd like to take that occasion to say that my parents didn't have a lot of formal education, but they were amazingly intellectual. I mean, they had a huge library, they read all the classics, Schiller, Goethe --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- Lessing. And they -- they were very b -- very mu -- very much interested in education and in reading.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My dad had read "Mein Kampf," and so he knew what Hitler was saying about the Jews, and was worried that he meant it. And so, they were concerned, I mean, no question about it. And -- but that was about the extent of it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did they wo -- di -- did they ever have conversations with you and your brother about life outside, about being careful, about possibly being attacked, or pi -- ki -- how kids -- how you should react if kids call you names or things?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not that much. I mean, it didn't happen that often, and I -- it may have been discussed, but I don't have any -- any real good recollections that I can give you.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Eric Simon *deg June 21, 2014</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But I think they were a little concerned about my being in a -- in a school with so few Jewish children. And of course, I noticed the discrimination not from the children, but from the higher ups, immediate -- very, very -- very quickly. I was a pretty good soccer player, and was what you would call now a striker. And together with the center, whose name was Krempel(ph), I happen to remember his name, we scored a lot of goals. And one day my -- the coach came to me and said, you can no longer play on the line, I'm gonna put you in the goal, because you're not going to be playing in the interschool game, because you're Jewish. And then I played goal for a while, and then I was out altogether. And the other time I was very uncomfortable is, they taught religion in school. So couple times I went along with -- for -- with the Catholic class, because I'd -- I was embarrassed to drop out. And then th-the -- our synagogue, the [indecipherable] in German it's called liberale Gemeinde, a liberal exa -- which is what -- here -- here would be called Conservative. We were members of that, and the religion teacher, also the cantor, is Herr Kappel(ph) would come to the high school, to the gymnasium and with the two or three of us, would have a master key, and look for an empty classroom, and give us religious classes. So that was a little uncomfortable being different from the rest of the -- the kids.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="23"></span> Interview with Eric Simon u June 21, 2014</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were the classes at the -- I mean, was it very visible and -- and obvious when you would go for those religion classes, or were they held at the same time as --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They were held at the same time and it was probably not that obvious, but I fel -- I wa self-conscious about it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And probably other kids were too.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But -- and then I--I also did some track in -- in gym and -- and so forth, and running, and I was pretty good at that. I really worked hard at athletics, cause I felt I would be better -- better off if I'm strong and -- and athletic than if I were a weakling and bookish and --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And wouldn't be able to defend yourself.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Also, the area [speaks German here].

And they ran this shi -- this sports organization, where we did a lot of athletics ranging from Ping Pong to soccer to handball. I don't know the -- you know the German handball. It's like soccer except you -- you dribble the ball and throw it at the goal.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And we -- that was a great activity that most of us enjoyed very much. The Germans also had called -- had something called an alliystoms(ph) medalia(ph), where you -- you have to -- it's like a decathlon or something. You have to do -- swim certain distance in certain time, you have ride your bike, you have to do all kinds of --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Measureable. Things that are --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Measure -- measureable things that have certain minimum you have to do, and if you do them all, then you get a medal. And when the Jews couldn't get that, so we had our own. Exactly with exactly the same metrics.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Didn't matter wi -- di--- in fact, those people were probably the ones that are most likely to die because they thought they -- they don't mean us. We're the -- we're the patriotic Germans.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Happened to be of Jewish faith, but they were totally wrong. And of course, people who were only part Jewish were also very insecure, cause they had no belonging. My parents were never very religious, but when Hitler came, they became -- I should say, I don't know whether to say more religious, but more belonging. In other words, they went to the synagogue more and wanted to be part of the congregation. They felt a need for this, because of the persecution.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: A sense of community.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. A sense of community, exactly, because of the persecution there.

There were a family, Zimmerman, who were not Jewish, but that's a name that can be either. There was a -- there was a family from Italy, I believe they were Jewish, but they -- they -- I don't remember the name. But they -- they made a lot of friends there, or my dad did and my -- as I said, my mother went with her sisters. I don't -- and I was never with her, so I don't know what kind of friends they made there. But my father had many friends there, you know [indecipherable]. And when I went with him, I went through my religious stage. I was 12 years old and wanted to be a rabbi.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And so I made a move to the Jewish kosher hotel, called the Hotel Edelweiss in Saint Moritz-Bad. And we had a very good time there, and that's where I really learned how to ski. We took some more lessons. My dad and I skied together and I took some lessons. Learned to Christie into the hill, and it became a real passion with me, although I never skied again from the time we left Germany, twel -- until -- from ni-nine -- from 1938 to 1955.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My --I wa--- we were lucky, nobody came and -- in-into our apartment. That's the advantage of a bigger city, there's so many of us, and in -- in apartment houses where the -- you're not quite sure where people live and -- I mean, people did get, some of -- but it was a little bit safer than in a smaller town. But my grandmother  <span class="page-break" number="43"></span> Interview with Eric Simon " June 21, 2014</p><p> and my grandfather -- well, by that time my grandfather was dead. My grandmother in Bingen --</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- she had all her -- her glasses and gristal -- crystal-wear and dishes destroyed.</p><p>Th-They had a real attack on her house. And -- so we didn't have that, but the following morning, when I was in school, one of my classmates said, Eric, did you know the synagogue's on fire? I said, what? I did -- I didn't believe it. It's -- first of all, it's a berg -- huge stone structure, I didn't even think it would burn.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So, then I discovered, when -- when school was over, my mother was at the door picking me up. My dad's ca -- had the -- the car there, and my mother said, come with me. I -- of course, I was upset that a big boy of 14 years old we -- picked up from school, and I had no idea what was going on, and --</p></p></dialogue>

And it turns out my dad didn't want to go home because he had heard of friends being picked up by the Gestapo and put in concentration camps that day. They picked up many, many able-bodied Jewish men.</p><p>They did -- they left the women and children still alone at that time.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But the men were picked up and put in concentration camps.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: What I want to -- excuse me, I know you have a train of thought, but it ---I--I want to ask you before, did you know of people disappearing before Kristallnacht, of somebody being arrested --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yes, absolutely. I mean, people were arrested for all kinds of things. We had, for instance, a friend who -- who was arrested and put in concentration camp for rassenschande, which is, he was dating -- he was supposed to be dating a Christian woman, or maybe he was married to a Christian woman, I don't recall. You know, this was a -- a doctor friend, if I remember correctly, who was put in a concentration camp because he was seen with a Christian woman. Now, they finally let him go, but he was pretty emaciated, and ill when he got out. Now absolutely, there were people arrested for all kinds of reasons, or -- or drummed up reasons. And some were let go, and some were not so fortunate. So the question of ca -- disappearing to c -- to concentration camps, that was already going around for quite a while.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay, so that --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I mean, most of the people in our building that ow -- my dad owned, were not Jewish.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And so that means that the con -- the real estate, had that already been confiscated, the building itself, or is it-- you lost that when you left?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Lost that when we left. My father lost -- lost another -- I think another -- wa -- something called [speaks German], which is some kind of mill and -- and warehouse, and he lost the apartment building, and later on got some restitution.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, termites, which were not true, and there were all kinds of things said about that house, so he got the very minimal amount for it, but he got something for it.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. So le-le-let's go -- we're -- we're jumping a bit, but let's go to that -- that section. We're talking now after the war. When did -- when -- what was the process of trying to get some sort of restitu -- you know, recompense?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That dragged out oda -- over years.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: When did it start? When did -- when did he find in --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Probably in the 50s.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>

I don't have a really good sense of the years. But my parents, as I said, got some restitution for the apartment house they shared with my aunt and uncle. And I think for some other things. I wanted to get -- get restitution for interruption of education. Now, I didn't have a lot of interruption, but I did have interruption.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And most of my friends, including my brother, got the restitution. It was like a thousand marks or 2,000 marks. And I got a letter from Wiesbaden saying I should be grateful that I was Jewish, otherwise I would end up in the German army, and who knows where I would be. And besides, I have a PhD degree. What am I complaining about?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh my God.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: So I went to court, and lost. And once you lose in the local court, you have to go to a court of appeals, where you have to pay a percentage, or a -- actually have to pay a-- not a percentage, you have to pay a fee to the lawyer, and even the lawyer said, don't gamble 20 percent of what you might get, for the fact that you might get, because you might not get it. And so we gave it up. And then when -- when -- when the people who got the restitution for the interruption of education got a second round -- of course, I didn't get the second round, because I didn't get the first round.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="54"></span>  58 Interview with Eric Simon June 21, 2014</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But that wasn't too serious because it really wasn't a huge amount of money.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No, it's the point of the thing, however.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: But the point is that -- that whole premise that I should be --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Grateful.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- write a thank you note to Hitler or something because I wasn't drafted into the German army, were sort of ridiculous, but the re --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I can't imagine you --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- the courts held that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. I can't imagine that somebody would have had the audacity in the postwar years to write that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, you know -- what apparently happened is that the Wiesbaden court, or -- or _~or--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Authority?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- government --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- was very generous for a while, and suddenly realized they were being too generous and they kind of had a backlash and g-got -- got the other way.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And I was one of the discussion leaders, as a -- after that lecture, we would ha -- break up into smaller groups, and ha -- and we would lead -- and those I did in English, because they really didn't understand enough German to conduct that in German. So they -- I was allowed speak English with them, because they were -- presumably knew some ger -- I wasn't teaching English at that point, I was leading discussions on American democracy and things like that.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: [remember the professors who gave lectures. They had one called Homer Smith -- not Homer Smith, I'm sorry.

By the way the -- my boss, my o -- ca -- officer in the first camp where I taught English was Henry Lee Smith, I think that was the name, who had a program on the radio where he would guess where people were born and where they were brought up. He was a -- like a linguist who didn't speak too many languages, but he -- incredible at knowing accents and learning accent and knowing how to distinguish accents.

I -- the only -- the only little thing I remember was when I was in -- in--I--I don't think I heard any real anti- Semitic remarks or anything like that, but when I was in Virginia, I accidently yers -- used to work meshugah.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I mean, there were some Yiddish words that had gone totally into the German language. Schmirastand(ph). The Hitler youth said schmirastand(ph) for -- for standing guard.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. And the Nazis like the Konidra(ph) tune so much that they played it on the radio and called it a Chinese melody or something like that.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But -- I don't remember too many details, but what -- one of the prisoners was a -- an artist and he painted my portrait. Somebody in my family has it. I think one of my kids.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: What I -- I'm say da -- but not when I was there, but actually when I was visiting.</p><p>We were invited back to germ -- to Wiesbaden.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can you count -- tell me a year?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I believe in the -- in the middle of late thir -- 90s.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And I went to -- as I mentioned, I think, earlier, I went to speak to the Gutenberg gymnasium where I had gone to school. And the kids were very interested, and I spoke in German, which I was fortunate to be able to do. And the professor was a friend of mine, whom I had met -- previously had come to our house with his wife, stayed with us a few days. I believe that was before -- or after, I'm not sure. But anyway, the -- he mentioned to me that he had a so -- given them a list of books to read. And the kids were about for -- 15 or 16, picked a book on Holocaust,  <span class="page-break" number="92"></span> ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion Interview with Eric Simon degdeg June 21, 2014 called [speaks German]. It was by a German boy, non-Jewish boy called Friedisch(ph) -- I believe it was Friedisch(ph). I think he was the -- the Gentile boy, who lived in the same apartment building with a family that had a Jewish boy his age, and they became very, very close friends. I read that book in one night, it was an incredible book. And it gave the -- the Jewish situation in Germany from the point of view of this Christian boy with -- who had this close Jewish friend. And the one scene I remember so vividly, is the Christian dad talking with the Jewish dad and saying, why don't you get out of here? Y-You see that they're not very nice to you and that it could get worse --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Worse.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: --and more dangerous, and leave. Take your family with you. And the Jewish dad said look, if this were the Middle Ages, and I would have to fear for my life, I would leave tomorrow. But this is Germany in the 20" century, a civilized country.</p><p>I don't have to fear for my life, and eventually Hitler will be gone and things will be normal again. This was such a common --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Refrain.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- frame of mind for -- for Jewish people. Whether they believed it or not, they certainly rationalized that -- that they would -- nobody would harm them physically, because it was a civilized country. And to some extent my parents, I'm sure used  <span class="page-break" number="93"></span> </p><p> 97 Interview with Eric Simon June 21, 2014 that argument as well. But it was really strike -- and we discussed that book when I spoke to the class, and of course they asked me questions about my experiences.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was there anything that they said in those discussions that also stay with you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: One thing stayed with me is that I really couldn't answer very well, and when a -- a boy said, we're paying restitution to our former Jewish citizens, who were clearly badly hurt. But why should we, the third generation, who had nothing to do with this, why should we -- should we pay this? And I didn't have a good answer. I don't remember what I said. You can argue this both ways, you could say look, your gra -- your grandparents did this, and so our -- some of your grandparents, and so you're still paying for what they did, just as -- as in this country some people are advocating restitution for the slaves. And we're certainly not responsible for slavery. And some argue that they're really not guilty. They -- they weren't born.</p><p>Something that's very difficult to --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: For you to come down on one side or the other?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right. Exactly, exactly.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Well, tell me a little bit about -- I mean, where -- again, we're -- we're skipping certain topics, but this sounds like an appropriate moment to ask, so what are your feelings about Germany? Many people who left never went back, never have any contacts, never engaged --  <span class="page-break" number="94"></span>  98 Interview with Eric Simon June 21, 2014</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And I know many.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And I understand perfectly. And especially when if you were in a concentration camp, or you were close to being gassed, or you have relatives that were murdered, I could totally understand. But having not had these horrible experiences, I would -- didn't feel quite that strongly, but it took me a very long time to want to go back.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did it really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It did. When we finally were invited back, I think that was the first time we went to Germany. No, we were there once before. I was on a sabbatical in Paris, and I took my family to Wiesbaden to see where I grew up.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But that would have been [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We were very uncomfortable, because we didn't know anybody, and the kids even were uncomfortable, and so we stayed about a day or two days and drove to Basel and went to Switzerland. Well, when I was invited back, it was already the third generation. The second generation was terrible. In other words, the people who were the children of the people who did some of these things, were t -- didn't want to talk about it. They were embarrassed, they were ashamed, and they wouldn't bring it up in school. The Holocaust simply wasn't discussed. And we, of course, resented that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="95"></span>  99 Interview with Eric Simon June 21, 2014</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But the third generation was totally different. They wanted to know the answers, they wanted to ask questions, they wanted to know what happened. How -- how were their families involved and not involved. So that was something that made me feel that it's time to forgive these chil -- these children who -- who had really basically nothing to do with it. They might be in -- I might have parents who anti- Semitic -- who brainwashed them, that I can't -- but I can't exclude that in any country.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: But I felt that this generation deserved at least a little bit more of an-- ofa rapprochement than the previous generations. And that's why I was willing to go there, and went back for scientific purposes. In other words, for visiting fellow scientists in Germany, for going to ger -- meetings in Germany. In fact, my first visit to Berlin was for a scientific meeting, maybe 10 years ago or something, first time [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah, it sounds like when this happened, as this developed, it was pretty late.</p><p>That is, it's decades after you've left.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh yes, it was --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: It's not --  <span class="page-break" number="96"></span> ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion Interview with Eric Simon " June 21, 2014</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- it was in the 90s that that happened.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: [""m quite sure. So it was like si-- 60 years in the --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Fifty or 60 years after I left. Yes, because by that time the people who -- who purp -- perpetrated all this were ei-either dead or extremely old.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The second generation was also getting older and the third generation really was making an attempt to know and to make up for what happened.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When you talk about the second generation, is that what you experienced when you went back to Germany? That first time was a family visit.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Actually, not directly, too much.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I mean, I-- we went to -- I was at a laundry mat, I think and told the people that I -- they asked why -- why I spoke German so well, and she told them I was born there. And she basically said, why did he come back? I -- if I were -- if I were a Jew I wouldn't -- I wouldn't come back, I mean, after what happened. Something like that. And so we actually got people who were decent and didn't have a direct experience, I heard a lot of things where people went to school and -- and -- friends  <span class="page-break" number="97"></span>  101 Interview with Eric Simon June 21, 2014 of ours, who said their parent were basically Nazis. This -- this family where the -- where the husband was the teacher where I -- where I spoke --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right, right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Her parents were real Nazis and left and fled to South America, and at home she couldn't open her mouth, because her parents were so pro-Hitler and anti- Jewish and everything else. And she became exactly the opposite, and her husband and she were extremely -- in fact, that brings me to a very important --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- thing about why -- another reason why I became a little more pro-German, or pro-German [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Engaged.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Or engaged, and less anti-German, whatever.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And that is, in Wiesbaden is a group called the f-- the [speaks German here]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And in the English translation that would be?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: English translation a -- ferdechai(ph) is a --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: An association of some kind?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- an association to further --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="98"></span> </p><p> 102 Interview with Eric Simon June 21, 2014</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- the hit -- a -- the history of the Jewish community of Wiesbaden. They built a Jewish museum [speaks German] and they collect documents from, and invite -- they were in -- they were also involved in our invitation to Wiesbaden and I gave them actually my mother's passport, and a few of the documents that I had left from -- from Germany, and they set up a museum. And they had -- constantly doing work to recognize people who hi-hid Jews, people who did heroic things, and Jews who -- who perished. And they have stolpersteine, have you ever have stolpersteine?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It means stumbling stones.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: But it really means that they take stones out of the sidewalk and put -- put a name -- put a name --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Of a person.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- on it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: In Wiesbaden and in many cities for people who perished, and have a pla--a---a --a monument where the da -- where the synagogue used to stand, and things like that, all done by this group, none of whom -- maybe one was Jewish, but most of  <span class="page-break" number="99"></span>  103 Interview with Eric Simon June 21, 2014 them were not. And they're still very active. And then I mentioned, I think earlier, in Limburg they have a group co -- a Christian -- a Christian Jewish --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- society, that works together. And I was very impressed with these people. And I can tell you, only one instance that really impressed me enormously. They persuaded the mayor of Wiesbaden, and the governance of Wiesbaden to change the name of this street, which had some nondescript name, Kurnigstrasse(ph) or --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Something like that, yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- to the Gebruder(ph) or the Geshvista(ph) I don't remember the name, Stoltz(ph), something like that, a Jewish brother and sister. And underneath it says, ermordet -- murdered on July so and so, 1942. And the street has that on it in -- in permanence.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And I thought that was an extremely courageous and very decent thing to do, is to actually have a street named after two Jew-Jewish children who were murdered in the Holocaust. And they did --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Maybe they lived on that street?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- many other wonderful things. Hm?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Maybe they lived on that street?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="100"></span>  104 Interview with Eric Simon June 21, 2014</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I don't think they did, but they lived in Wiesbaden.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: They didn't -- ah, I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, I think they picked the street cause it didn't have a particularly important name, but I don't know that for sure. But that was -- and the ceremony that we were at when this was done, I mean, the mayor was there, th-the members of the c -- city council, whatever and all kinds of -- of somebody -- I think somebody from the government of hess -- Hessen was there, and it was really a big deal. So I--I thought that was -- and that was done in the 90s there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Well, you know, wa -- in order for someone to see these things, a first step has to be taken --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Exactly.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- to become engaged again.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Exactly.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And it's taking that first step, which is usually the hard part.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Exactly, absolutely. I mean, I still have some feelings, obviously, that that could happen in a co -- in a country as quote civilized as Germany, that produced the Beethoven, that produced the Einstein, that produced people like that, and that that could happen is still incredible to me. And when there's a sports contest, I often root against Germany. It's just something, and I -- while I buy German -- some  <span class="page-break" number="101"></span>  105 Interview with Eric Simon June 21, 2014 German product -- I -- I can't get myself to buy a German car, even though they're very good. And so there's still some of these prejudices left, and I'm -- it's not surprising. But I can see when people have direct loved ones that perished, and -- are going to be much more anti than somebody like me, who was fortunate enough not to have any close friends or relatives that perished in the Holocaust.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, I think in -- in these things, it's -- it's very individual.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Of course.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: It's ver -- you know, the --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Of course, absolutely.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And it's very hard, and -- and I don't think it's possible, nor should it be, that there's a prescription of how --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- at -- at what point should one say this?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You can't. You can't.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You can't. People --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: It's a totally individual thing.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- and I just wanted to give credit to my parents because they paid for their college, and made it possible for me to give -- to get a profession. And I told you I got a--a degree essentially in chemical engineering.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: That was my choice.

And the-they discharged me. And I went to the University chica -- Chicago and took a master's and PhD degree in organic chemistry. Now this is very interesting. I didn't take any biology courses, but I audited biochemistry. And I came to the realization that while I enjoyed organic chemistry to a degree, I didn't enjoy reading the literature. I mean, I would look at the Journal Organic Chemistry and it would say, a new synthesis in the anthraquinone series. And I said, who cares? But when I learned something about biochemistry, and at that time was the time when it -- what was called [indecipherable] very, very much in the research area. In other words, how the body metabolizes food to create energy, to create growth. And that was so exciting, and I made up my mind right then and then, as I was a graduate student, that I wanted to get into biochemistry. And when I finished my PhD thesis, which was a strictly organic chemistry thesis, with a prof -- very  <span class="page-break" number="104"></span> Interview with Eric Simon ns June 21, 2014</p><p> famous professor called Professor Morris Kharasch, who almost got the Nobel Prize because he -- he developed a new -- brand new field in organic chemistry, the field of -- of free radicals in solution. When I received my -- finally received my degree, and I was in graduate school almost five years, that was because he was very demanding, and the -- there wasn't this -- a closed project, it wasn't finish -- finished, he would -- he would say now finish this, okay, Ill give you another project. But I mean, eventually got out and di-did fine. I actually applied for a fellowship. At that time the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, Polio Foundation, gave a fellowship specifically for people who were in the hard sciences like physics and chemistry and wanted to get into biology. And so I took a--I---I-I ge --I got this, and it was -- I was one of the winners, and I took a postdoctoral fellowship for two years at Columbia, and at that time Irene and I -- and I haven't said anything about my family life, but I will --</p></p></dialogue>

Then I got my first real job at Cornell Medical School. I kept moving downtown.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Where I worked on a-- on a project on muscular dystrophy. It actually was a project on vitamin E metabolism because the only model of muscular dystrophy that was known at the time were rabbits that got flabby muscles by not eating enough vitamin E, having a vitamin E deficiency. And we made some interesting discoveries in that area. But I didn't stay in there. What happened was I -- my boss, Dr. Millrat(ph) was the medical director of the muscular dystrophy foundation of America, and they built him -- Cornell built him an institute for muscle disease.</p><p>And of course, as usual, not ready when it was supposed to be ready, so I took a sort of sabbatical at NYU in a friend's lab, Werner Maas(ph), also a German refugee.</p><p>And spent a year there. And during the year, Professor Louis Thomas -- you may have heard his name, I don't know. He was not only an outstanding scientist and physician, he was author of a number of books. Li-- "The Lives of the Cell," An evening with -- with -- with Moller(ph), I think, a medicine [indecipherable] signs  <span class="page-break" number="106"></span> </p><p> 110 Interview with Eric Simon June 21, 2014 were -- by the way, I have a paragraph that he wrote about me to his -- that sort of autobiographical book. Anyway, Louis Thomas approached me about coming to NYU and gave me a very nice position as assistant professor at NYU in department of medicine. He wanted me strictly -- I mean, I'm -- I'm a PhD, I'm not an MD, so the only thing I could do was research, and I got a teaching appointment in -- at that time spa -- microbiology, cause that's where my -- that's where I was with Werner Maas(ph). So I had an appointment for -- do research in medicine, and -- and -- and a teaching appointment in microbiology. And after I was there a fairly short period, maybe a year, I-- my -- my boss, Dr. Thomas came to me and said, the city of New York is setting up a -- something called the Research Council of New York. And one of the purposes, the main purpose of this organization is to give what they call career awards to young, promising scientists to keep them in the city. I'd like for you to apply, and if you do that, I'd like you to think about maybe -- even though I don't want you to give up what you're doing if you're so interested in it. But I'd like you to think about something you could do that might interest a city, that might make it easier for you to get the fellowship, the research career award. To make a long story short, I chose drug addiction as something would interest a city.</p></p></dialogue>

And that's how I got into my eventual real field, and I got into neuroscience by the back door. I knew nothing about brain anatomy, nothing about brain physiology. I edit -- I audited some courses at Columbia when I was post-doc, and I order -- audited some more at NYU, and I read. It wasn't easy, but it was fun. And I got the fellowship, obviously. I had it for 15 years, I didn't lose it, 1-- we lost the research council, it went belly up. The city decided it didn't have the money --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: To fund it.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- to continue it. And for 15 years almost -- and my entire salary came from the city of New York.</p></p></dialogue>

So they gave out -- I don't know how many, but they gave out a -- maybe a hundred a year or something. And we had annual meetings where we reported our results. And then they went belly up, and I had to put at least part of my salary on my grant. But I--I stayed at NYU the rest of my career. I had a couple of possibilities of becoming chairman, but I didn't go. And I -- what I accomplished was I published about 270 papers, basically in the area of opiate -- opiate research,  <span class="page-break" number="108"></span>  112 Interview with Eric Simon June 21, 2014 how does the brain react to opiate, what do -- what do they do when they get there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>And the major be -- discovery we made was discover the so-called opiate rezept -- receptors in the brain.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell me a little bit about that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: These are protein molecules --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- to which these drugs must bind in order to perform what they perform, namely</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: The high?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The highs, the lows an-and you know, the dysphoria in some cases. The pain relief. All the things they do, they do many things. The respiratory depression, which kills you within -- when you get -- when you have an overdose. All these can only be done -- can only happen if the drug binds to the opiate receptors, to these protein molecules.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And is it ams -- in my very layman's terms, because as I --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Sure.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- said before our interview, I'm not very versed in --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right, may -- you're not a scientist.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="109"></span>  113 Interview with Eric Simon June 21, 2014</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Does this mean that the discovery was how the drugs actually affect the brain in its -- in -- in its most --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. Yes, and how it affects, on a basic biochemical level.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right, okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It binds to this molecule called the receptor.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: As we call it, the receptor -- and by the way, just to be fair, there was three laboratories that made the discovery si-simultaneously.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. One was Pert and Snyder at Hopkins, Johns Hopkins. One was a very nice gentleman at U-Uppsala, Sweden, called Lars Terenius, and my lab.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And a little bit better than a year later, maybe two years later -- yeah, that was in deg73, a group in Scotland, but also a German Jewish refugee, Hans Kosterlitz and his [indecipherable] John Hughes discovered the endorphins, the substance in the brain for which th-the receptors were there. They were not there for people who shoot up heroin, or take morphine for pain; they were there for the su-substance which we call er -- endorphins.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="110"></span> </p><p> 114 Interview with Eric Simon June 21, 2014</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And it may interest you to know that I coined the term endorphins. I didn't fa -- discover the substances, but I named them. I'm the godfather. And wish I had a --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I'm impressed.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: --a dollar for every time it's used.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That would be not bad.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, it wouldn't, no.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That would be not bad at all.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: At any rate, and that -- well we -- we did a great deal of work on what's called signal transduction, which means what happens between the time these drugs, or the endorphins, bind to the receptors in the time the drug is abused or euphoria happens, a high happens, or pain is relieved.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And while we still don't know the whole story, we know a great deal of what some of the biochemical steps are between the binding of these drugs, or the endorphins and subsequent events.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You mentioned earlier that your -- you would have wanted to be a doctor. Is that something that you knew that you wanted to do when you were younger?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, not -- you know, actually, while I did think about that, and I wrote -- and I was -- I actually got excited early about medical research when I read things like  <span class="page-break" number="111"></span> </p><p> 115 Interview with Eric Simon June 21, 2014 "The Microbe Hunter," by de Kruif. I actually, partly because my dad kept saying to me -- and I don't want to blame him, but oh, you don't ne -- you don't like to see the sight of blood, you'll never be a doctor, I never applied to medical school. I just made up my mind I wanted to do re -- scientific research. Had I -- had I to do it over, I think I would have, because I think you get a --a little wider horizon by -- by taking the medical courses. And I only audit -- e-edited -- audited --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Audited.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- some of them. But even then you don't get, you know, you don't do -- do the homework pr-properly. And -- and some of them I never took. I never took a course in histology. I never took a course in anatomy. I had to learn it -- all my [indecipherable] course I didn't learn as well as if I had formal courses. So it would have been good to have at le -- at least a more biological approach. But for some reason I never applied, and this is how I got there, via degree in organic chemistry [indecipherable] in biochemistry and then tr-transferred to different areas.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But it's such a -- it has such implications for human well-being, to be able to understand that that's what [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Absolutely. And you know, this is not that unusual. For instance, you've heard of Watson and Crick --  <span class="page-break" number="112"></span> Interview with Eric Simon ne June 21, 2014</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But Watson was a-- was a student in biology or biochemistry or something, but Crick was as physicist. He didn't know any biology.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And there are many cases like that, biochemists, physicists, psychologists, got into the field of neuroscience and did remarkable things.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, thank you for sharing that with us. And you wanted also to talk a little bit about your family.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So while we were still -- when I was still in graduate school, we had our first son, Martin, who is now a professor of math education at NYU.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And three years later, in New York, right, we had our daughter Faye, who is -- was for many years a very fine early childhood schoolteacher, whom -- when I say fine, I mean the parents loved her, the children loved her, and -- and her fellow teachers loved her, so sh -- it must have been something --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- she did right. She doesn't do that any more, and what she did do is she set up a foundation in Irene and my honor, called the Irene and Eric Simon reser -- be -- Brain Research Foundation.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right, right. Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And many of them have ended up in -- in neuroscience, and -- or be -- ac -- starting to study neurosciences.</p></p></dialogue>

And tell me, what was it about being a rabbi that attracted you? That -- that -- what appealed?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: That's a difficult question to answer, except I -- I was impressed with our rabbi, Rabbi Paul La-La-Lazarus(ph) in Wiesbaden who -- who spoke at my -- who -- who Bar Mitzvahed me essentially, taught me my lessons -- some of my Bar Mitzvah lessons and gave the -- the sermon, and he was a very good speaker, and I admired him a great deal. That may have had a lot to -- and I went through a --a religious period in my life, which for better or for worse, disappeared pretty quickly after I found out about the Holocaust.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, here was a question, yes, do you consider yourself religious today?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="119"></span>  123 Interview with Eric Simon June 21, 2014</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. I mean, I consider myself as a very positive, cultural Jew, a-and ethnic Jew.</p><p>I'm very proud of anything that the Jewish community does that I like, whether it's sports or science or medicine or anything. And I -- I -- I like to belong to a Jewish congregation because it gives me a feeling of belonging. As for a belief in God, I'm afraid that's gone. I wish I did. It would make life much easier, would make dying much easier.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: But I can't believe in it personally. I mean, I -- I can believe in a-- in a-- some kind of super power. I cannot believe in a personal God that would answer que -- prayers or punish you or reward you. Simply, the evidence is not there. So --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Thank you.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- maybe I shouldn't have said this, but --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: No, no, I asked, I asked.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- this is how I feel. So then that -- that idea. And then of course, I got excited about science, so that kind of went by the wayside.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell me a little bit about how your accomplishments have been received.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, yes, I-- they've been, of course, received very well. I mean, we -- publishing 250 - 300 papers doesn't go unnoticed.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="120"></span>  124 Interview with Eric Simon June 21, 2014</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And many of them were ve -- were very good, and very useful. And they led to some rewards. I not -- I'm only going to give you two or three that are --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: --remarkable. One is that -- and one of my favorites was that I got an honorary doctorate from the University of Paris and the Sorbonne.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Congratulations.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Not only was that a very nice honor, but it was also a very nice occasion. And ma -- my wife, my son -- oldest son, and my mother, and my brother and my sister- in-law were all at -- in Paris for the occasion, and we had a wonderful time. And as soon as we're finished with the wonderful time in Paris, and an extremely moving ceremony with a chamber music group playing music, and with a -- walking in with the --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- the academic garments and with my -- my godfather, mon parrain making a speech as to why I deserve it, there were six others, all in different fields: philosopher, mathematician, biologist and s -- and so forth. And I have lovely pictures of them. As soon as we got f-finished with all this and sent all the relatives home, except my brother and -- I think my brother and sister-in-law, of course my  <span class="page-break" number="121"></span>  125 Interview with Eric Simon June 21, 2014 son -- my -- well, we sent my mother home. We went to s Zermatt, Switzerland, our fave -- our favorite ski place.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you skied.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- and we skied.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, we did that from the early seven -- 70s to about 2010. Almost -- almost every winter.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How wonderful.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And the -- then I got a very nice prize from the New York Academy of Science, and I don't recall the -- it was the name of two brothers and it was distinguished in the way that it was given by New York Academy of Sciences, and the fact that, I think foreign people before me had won the Nobel prize. So it was given to some pretty good people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Wow.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And I got an award from the nation's drug abuse as one of their outstanding researchers, called the -- oh, I'm blocking out the name.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It's okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: People who -- who make discoveries, I -- and I got a number of other awards and name lectures, in other words, lectures in high memory of people who had died, in  <span class="page-break" number="122"></span> Interview with Eric Simon me June 21, 2014</p><p> honor of people who were being honored. So i-it's -- it's been a very, very, very gratifying to ha -- be recognized by one's peers. My -- my medical school has also been very generous. In 2005 they did an all-day symposium in my honor. Oh, by the way, in 1997, I believe, a journal called Neurochemical Research did a -- a whole volume in my honor, with my picture with an article by a colleague, Dr. Huda(ph) Akeel(ph), a Syrian born, lovely lady with the University of Michigan, who wrote an article about why I deserved the honor. And in the -- the s-symposium at my university was -- all day symposium with very outstanding people lecturing and saying nice things about me. And then about two or thr -- three or four years ago, the medical school set up a annual lecture, called the Eric Simon lecture. And so far, thank goodness, it's not in memorial, it's in my honor. But hopefully it'll be continued.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Any final thoughts? You -- that -- this is quite an impressive roster. Thank you for -- for sharing it.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Final thoughts.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I just think that compared to so many of my friends and so many of my fellow Jews, I've been extremely lucky and some of what I've told you may be almost -- not seem very -- very, very important compared to what all these people  <span class="page-break" number="123"></span>  127 Interview with Eric Simon June 21, 2014 went through. I guess these are my own [indecipherable] for not having been murdered or having been hurt in a serious way, as have the others coming out. But I think these experiences are still important to remember how life was in Germany, and here, for that matter, during the -- during that -- that period.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, I--I couldn't agree more. People had different experiences, but this entire -- this entire historical epoch didn't leave anybody untouched.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I -- that's for sure.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And -- and -- and part of what our job is, is to try and collect some of those fragments.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yes. Through individual experiences. Just like --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I mean, even my -- my army service -- well, I would have gone over and fo- fought if they had sent me.</p></p></dialogue>

And I'm still here at 90, and it's not everybody can make that statement either, and I'm still in pretty good health, and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: That's also very impressive. Very impressive.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So that's very much my final comment, and I thank you for a very nice interview.</p></p></dialogue>
