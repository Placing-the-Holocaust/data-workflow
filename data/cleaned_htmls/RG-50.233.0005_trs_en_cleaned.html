How he was saved, he broke up that time with Stalin and Lenin.</p><p>They were all together when they started out the Revolution. He was a Socialist when they broke up. He start running away. When he came into a village and that particular village was a blacksmith and he run into the blacksmith and put him down the arm against the wall with Jewish religious things on him and the Cossacks chasing were chasing him, they came in, they looked for him and they couldn't find him. They saw him and when they came out back so the officer said to him did you see him. He said no, there's an old man, an old Jew with his pals and his tzitses (spelling).

As soon as he passed away --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: What happened?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Anti-Semitism. They used to have boycotts.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How about your father's meat stores?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yeah. Meat is another story to talk about. We used to kill kosher meat . They passed a law that they wanted to take away from people Jewish kosher killed. The whole world protested at that time, 1937, 38. So finally they permitted to kill kosher so much and so much. I will never forget as long as I live, we used to sell a lot of restaurants in Bialystok. So one morning I came in like 5:00, 6:00 in the morning . The main meal is lunchtime, so they stopped cooking about 7:00, 8:00 in the morning, so I had to be in the store 5:00, 6 o'clock in the morning. We had one store wasn't too far from the railroad station so at 5 o'clock when the shift changes in the railroad workers so they banged on the door. Mr. Bass, Mr. Bass, grandfather died. That's how we heard the news that the grandfather passed away.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Grandfather Pilsudski? Besides the boycott and the limit on kosher killing of animals for meat, were there other changes after he died?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I wouldn't say I exactly remember. Like I said before, you're young and you don't realize those Naturally there were a lot of changes . (The tape is difficult to hear). The Germans had a lot of influence at that time. In our hometown lived a lot of Germans. They remained from the First World War. They were manufacturing textiles. Bialystok is the second largest city in Europe in textiles.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You described the German population of Bialystok. When it came to anti- Semitism who was the greatest danger to you, the Germans of Bialystok or the Poles?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So there were pogroms in Bialystok?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>9  <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not in Bialystok direct because Bialystok was 85 to 90 percent Jewish city. So they didn't start it up. Bur there were some other cities</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Three stores -- bourgeois. And they sent him where?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My father was liberated, he was innocent. When he came in, the same day he came in when my father was arrested, we came into the police station and started asking for my father. So they told us to see one of the big jails there. We used to cut our bread in half and send the other half to my father. After the liberation in 45-46, my father and I got together, my father and I lived together. We slept in one bed and we cried our tears out. He told me he has never seen Brisk (?), he never even knew how it looked. They put him in</p><p> . They sent him six weeks -- sixty days and sixty nights.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Siberia?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Six weeks, they took him that long. He always used to kid me. If you would be there we used to cut trees, he used to tell me a dozen people could dance a waltz on it such huge trees.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No one knew what happened to him, no letters, nothing?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Nothing. We didn't expect that. But right when the war ended, he used to write letters. In Bialystok, we used to have a guy used to take care of our accounts. He was an accountant, so my father used to send a letter to him and we used to send</p><p> 10  <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection letters from Germany because we were liberated from Germany. Somehow my sister was liberated not far from Poland and we spoke to each other said we going to be liberated we'll all come back to Bialystok. But who knew the circumstances with Germany and Russia with borders and all that, but she made it into Poland.</p><p>Came to my home town there were maybe ten, twelve people, they all left</p><p> they couldn't stay there .

In that same factory they built up a place with a platform, they used to go every night dancing. I was a youngster, I was dressed nicely and the director was a Russian guy. He used to come over all the time and ask "where did you get it?" I said, what do you mean where did we get it? We bought it. I was young, I didn't know what to answer.
