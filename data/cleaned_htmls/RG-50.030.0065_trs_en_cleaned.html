I have got back memories of I was locked, this was in the thirties when Hitler had taken over Germany and well he had to kind of, well you know, he stimulated a Nazi movement in Denmark. Of course, Nazi movements , against the Jews. But what I meant by this, some instant in the school yard, and I must have been very unhappy because our headmaster who had finished , he was a priest by , by background, but running this prep school. [headmaster's name] called me up to his office and <span class="page-break" number="0"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> was not a very tall fellow, must have been about sixty or so. The Torah was almost as tall as he was. It was a beautiful decorated , of the family had made with the cover <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> me a couple of years ago, I had a schoolmate who is also of Jewish origin in this elementary school, this schoolmate, uh, came from an assimilated family, , | mean they came probably two or three generations before us. They came from a place in Germany called Desow (ph) and the name of the family to this day remains Desow (ph) and he told me when we met by chance a couple of years ago, that, uh, I was always dressed in brown, for some reason my mother always thought that brown suited me well, uh, and of course a very unharmonious relationship between me and the color brown , | can't stand it, but that is how <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> Janisport(ph) when the Germans just marched into neutral Denmark and Denmark had to know that of course they could provide heroes, get heroes had they fought. But they had no political or military power to assist the Danish, the German occupation forces. Demark succumbed, made a deal with the Germans, a deal by the way which is of great significance to our life as Jews because that set us apart from the rest of the Jewish community in Europe, occupied Europe, because the made a deal with the Germans based on a kind of mutual respect, so to say, sharing of, sharing of authority. The Danes(ph) got permission from the Germans to go on with their normal lives. Political parties were non-functioning, the parliament went on giving laws, the government was inside, the King was riding through the town followed by a crowd of school children on his horseback and so to say for most days in these years, the first years of the occupation, life was relatively normal, of course we were effected by the war and by the supply situation, but basically the Germans let the Danes(ph), you know, keep to themselves and run their own lives. We had two, we had two free parliamentary elections Denmark <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> distinction between Danish citizens. Meaning that no special anti-Jewish legislation, no interference with Jewish life at the synagogue, the synagogues were operating the schools, were operating the old age homes, whatever you had so the structure of the Jewish community remained untouched by the German occupation until a certain moment of course, which was the famous day of 29th of August 1943. I want to just relate one thing, of course the Jews knew about what was on in Europe, but vaguely, you know we didn't even know in 1942, in September, October the Germans had arrested the majority of the Norwegian Jews, although we were related to the community, intermarriage between the communities and youthful activities, we didn't know because we kind of lived in empty space, we didn't have information. We could hear pbe of course, but pbe didn't know much about the holocaust either until 1943, we didn't know about the Warsaw Ghetto for instance, and the allies did not consider this a very important item in the news broadcasting, so we lived as a matter of fact in a fools paradise. Being persuaded to believe that the normal life we lived could continue without end. In the Danish community, by the way, was influenced by the Danish patricians, the Danish officials went on telling us, don't be afraid, we'll protect you because we have told the Germans if they touch the Jews this is what you call , this would be cause for war and then we would <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> Germans at all felt threatened by, not at all. Maybe it consisted of a few hundred Danish people, but didn't want to enjoy the benefits of this Danish-German agreement. People <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> into the community again. But, I still remember, there are some parts in history which you remember vividly where you are standing or sitting with the other guy, like the story with the typing, I remember that I was asked to sit down. I was standing up and he was sitting behind a huge desk with his , his and had a beard like or square, long beard, very well groomed, but you know. They told me that they, he ordered me to give up all this playing around and he said, I remember this today, if you don't give it up, you and others of your sort, you know, will risk the welfare of the Jewish community because if the Germans catch you or the Danes catch you revenge might be taken and that might put the whole safety of our community in danger. So, give it up. The moment that you have been told that you have the responsibility for a whole community and you're only fifteen years old, of course you'll give it up. So I went home and I burnt, and burnt all that was left of the illegal books and newspapers and so on. That must have been immediately before the trip to or immediately <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> and he never warned us. I just want to tell in brackets a little human angle. We escaped of course and came back a couple of years(ph) later from Sweden and right after our return my parents sent this, by then had retired, a big bunch of flowers saying, don't worry, you didn't warn us but we got away and safely we came back. Now, whether they heard anything from me or not, I don't know, it was a very, very difficult situation of course, being faced with this old preach of promise. But many, many years later when I was serving as chief editor of the Danish daily newspaper called, Put___.(ph) maybe 50 years later...and one of our staff members aboard the 22 union(ph) it was not very easy because he sort of wanted to stay out of the limelight. I called him and asked him to make an exception and our reporter.</p><p>He said, well I'll tell you one thing, there's one bunch of flowers I received one night which I will never forget. These were the flowers which your parents sent me in 1945 after you came back from refuge in Sweden. It meant a lot to him that some people were trying to forgive him for having broken his promise. Which of course could have cost us our lives, of course. At any rate, so the Danish underground movement started becoming more and more of a nuisance to the Germans. At one point the Germans wanted the Danish Government, the Danish authorities had control over the Danish army, the Danish police, everything was in place. The Germans wanted the Danes to take steps in order to crush the underground movement and to the Jews they sentenced for sabotage of court(ph) and so on and so forth. Well it's a long story, but the Danes refused the whole set up, so to say once abolished(ph) and the Germans were sitting with the mark in their hands and . Then come September, September month and somebody else was figuring on what happened politically, especially on the German scene(ph) with regard to our situation as Jews in Denmark. But suffice here to say that the Germans decided to extend the Jewish repression to Danish Jews, about 6,000 maybe 7,000 we were at that time and they ordered three ships to come from Germany and anchor in Copenhagen preparing to take us and a group of communists who had been imprisoned by the Danish authorities who had not yet been released, not succeeded in being released when the authorities went home. So the Germans simply arrested them as one of the most, most <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> dishonorable, dishonorable events in modern day history, by the way. Of course they were arrested and kept against the constitution. Anyhow, the ships were prepared to take 7,000 Jews and a few hundred communists to Germany or to Poland, whatever they planned to do. But then something happened which enabled us to be warned beforehand and just shortly a warning came from the German who was the head of the German occupation authorities in Denmark. His name was Wern Best(ph), Wern with a "W", Best, B-E-S-T and he instigated the entire Jewish activities by advising Hitler that now was the time after the Danish-German cooperation had collapsed, now was the time to go for the Jews. But for his own reasons, which is a very complicated matter, I don't want to go into too many details because people are much more versed into the details than I am. For his own reasons, he let the secret slip out and told one of his collaborators in the German, in the German embassy . A fellow who <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0 to the station. Tuckawitz quoted Best as saying, "I wish we could build a bridge across the south between Denmark and Sweden to aid these poor people to get safely away." We never, we never know if Tuckawitz invented this, there's no motive for his having to invent it, but there's no third witness. You only have his word for it that Best didn't say it(ph), not because he loved(ph) Jews, he had been spending half his year fighting Jews, killing Jews. But his didn't find that it was in his best interests that particular moment of history where everything was going against the German, the German arms, after the invasion of Italy. After the collapse of the German, the German military that fought in the Stantengard(ph) in Eastern Russia, in Russia. It was not for his, in his interests that this anti-Jewish action should secede, that's why he told it to Tuckawitz who immediately informed the German, the Danish social-democratic(ph) leaders, who immediately went to the head of the Jewish community, a very respectable and respective lawyer of the high court called C.B. Pedricus(ph), a famous Jewish name. And they went to him and told him, okay, now you better prepare for something because there are only a couple of days left. And it's very interesting, it has to be remembered because part of the Disney Land atmosphere which we lived, they were killing Jews all over, all around us. From Norway and all through the continent and we thought that we would go Scot-free and didn't prepare for anything.</p><p>The Jewish community and leadership didn't even destroy the index of names and addresses of the Jewish community. The Germans came one day and confiscated it. Still this was not enough for us, so start moving, you know. And this guy in and the Danish <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 1 Germans will come after us. Where you go, everybody was on his own. The community had not prepare any escape route or any escape organization, nope, nothing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did your father hear? Do you remember?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: My father, yes, my father heard this from somebody who had called him, who had been to morning prayers in the synagogue on September 13th I think. And he came home, I was in school, you know, we went on acting as if life was normal, you know, and as if we were as Danish as the Danes; which to some extent we were, at least in the eyes of the Danes, but not in the eyes of the Germans of course. By the way there was no yellow star, you know, there were no, there were no special legislation introduced by the Germans as regards to the Jewish part of the Danish community, Danish population. I went to school early in the morning, maybe at ten o'clock or so, the headmaster came in and he said, "I'm sorry but you and you," he said, "you better come out, I have something to tell you in the corridor." And I remember that suddenly we got up from our desks and were following him. Suddenly he turned around again and he said to the teacher, "you better come with me too." The teacher was also a part Jewish and then the fade away(ph). But you know, at that time, I was fifteen, I was fifteen <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 2</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Herbert, I would like to begin by asking you about your family background and when your parents or grandparents came to Denmark.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, as a matter of fact I am the first generation born in Denmark. My father's side the family came just after the turn of the century from Ukraine, a town called Romney. Which is quite a famous town in Jewish history because a guy named Toebetor, who became a hero in the Palestine fighting(ph) with the Arab's(ph) back in the 20's came from there. Another guy called Rotenbeck(ph) who made the first project for electrification(ph) of Palestine there.</p><p>My, , the first group of chim(ph) agricultural pioneers came from the same small town called Romney and they settled at the canya(ph) and they formed the first</p><p> . Now my grandfather was what they call a kabaducmaha(ph). That means <span class="page-break" number="11"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 3 better get out as quick as possible. So the pack(ph) that was left and of course they were on their way to America, like most Jews, millions of Jews during these years went to America. Being poor people the money quickly was spent when the in Germany they had no more money to pay for their passage across the Atlantic. So they made up their mind to go to some place called Denmark. Why Denmark, because my grandmother had a brother who had immigrated earlier to Denmark and he had sent some postcards saying that it was not a bad country. So the thoughts in their heads were let's go where the money reached, the money took them to Gomain(ph), that was, as I said around 1905 or 6 or something. And they settled down in one of the poorest quarters of Copenhagen, which today of course is Bohem(ph) quarter and were renovated(ph) slum houses. It was, but they went there because it was Jewish district and they could meet people which spoke their language, which was not Russian it was Yettish, they were not Russian speakers. And they could somehow repeat and rebuild to some extent the medium(ph) in which they had lived.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: A religious ?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, that's what I want to add. Another reason why they went their was that it was not far away, within walking distance from the synagogue. For them the synagogue was the center in their lives, both the religious life and the sacred(ph) life they lived.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Which synagogue?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well it was, it was the synagogue which belonged to the Uta(ph) orthodox and the community which was built around that time. , it was not at that time as far as my grandfather goes, the big synagogue which had the kind of modernistic service, although it's conservative. He looked for his people and they were at this small synagogue.</p><p>Of course, the , my father's generation they left the synagogue and joined the <span class="page-break" number="12"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 4 and in a few cases were not Jews or became non-observant. But still of course were some hang(ph) for tradition, you know, they speak about two kinds of Jews: they speak about Balkhudan(ph); means Jews whose sits in the stomach, gives <span class="page-break" number="12"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 5 Danish workers. He could feel rejected by them and the country, so he had a very, since then, he so to say P [person's name] admired the Jews to politics and he became very, very <span class="page-break" number="12"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 6 or 8 day work week, you know, a 7 or 8 hour work week. They worked as much, as long as they needed to provide, to supply those that gave them to consignments. They started establishing themselves and moving from this very poor street to this street in the same neighborhood which was a little bit less poorer, and I have a list at home which one of my uncles made where he noted all of the addresses within the first couple of years. It was tremendous, this was kind of migrant population. they had more money, they got another child, they moved into a flat with a half room more, bedroom more, that's how they slowly, slowly progressed and moved into more boudoir quarters and became, as a matter of fact part of the Danish middle class.</p><p>Within probably the early 30's they had become middle class.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Living separately in a Jewish community within the Danish middle class?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no, when the moment they moved out of the poor quarter, of course they moved into the middle, they used the Danish community. I wouldn't say that they had lots of social contact with them of course, because still their religion and the synagogue was, so to say, the axis of their life.</p><p>But of course, there were 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, there were 8 children and of course the children reached out towards Danish society. You probably had the same effect that you have today, many Danish girls attempted to strike up relationships with types from the Mediterranean and these were not Mediterranean's, but they were exotic at least. And Denmark at that time was a very, very homogenous society and when these young Jews came to Copenhagen, they were attractive and exotic. By the way many of them married non-Jewish, already(ph) in the first generation.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And how did your grandfather react to that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You know, you know what happens, I don't know if this is pattern, but anyhow in my experience is that there are several phases. One of the phases, one is a phase of shock. The second is the phase of slowly adapting but not reestablishing contacts. The third phase is when the first child is born and then the whole bloody thing breaks down, you know you can't, then relations are reestablished and everybody's is happy. But at any rate, I just want to <span class="page-break" number="13"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 7 speaking friend, and we went to Kiev(ph) and we asked if anybody would take us to this place which is about 150 kilometers from Romney and everybody shied away and said, no you need a special permit, this is a closed country. So we found a very unhappy driver, unhappy because he was deeply indebt for playing some kind of, I don't know, hasard(ph) or whatever it was. One of his other friends, and couldn't pay his debt to the people who he owed money, they were people, very strong armed people. One of his friends had to explain to us, we should jump out of the window because was jumping himself or being thrown out of the window, so he <span class="page-break" number="14"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 8 Palestine at that time, later Israel. That was around 1908, or something of that close, maybe 1909. But I asked my grandfather, why didn't you join them, you were the same age group and you had to leave your town anyhow? Why did you have to take this long route around Copenhagen and what not, just for me 50 odd years afterwards to have to rise and go to Zion(ph), you know, all the troubles. We could have landed there earlier, be part of the aristocracy. So he said, "are you crazy," I would never have guessed this, he said, "do you think that I would have joined a gang where the Tracy Malicker(ph)," it's a Yettish, it's a Yettish derivation of Melcher(ph) which is a female name in Hebrew, "the Tracy Malicker, should I join these barefoot people, you know, they walk around barefoot." It's true, that the first you know, that they called them the "ball fees(ph)," the barefeet, because they were poor and they made an issue about being puretanic(ph) and so. Well anyhow I decided that, well, they were crazy we all could see that they were crazy, we all could see that they were crazy, you know. I decided that I wanted to find out what this crazy Malicker(ph) had been doing and I called the keeboots(ph) and they found out that this crazy Malicker(ph) who my grandfather didn't want to join, she became one of the most prominent educators in the Palestine Zionist(ph) Keeboots(ph) movement. But anyhow, to jump ahead, we, my grandfather, became retired and my father started working at the Petlier(ph), the famous 7 , you know. They only went to <span class="page-break" number="15"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 9 of years old they settled in Litic(ph). I'm sure I inherited some of the adventurous spirit of that part of the family because my grandfather, my great-grandfather...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: On your mother's side.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In the late ages they immigrated from Poland to America and came back and settled in Litic(ph). He called his family from Poland to Litic(ph), Litic(ph) is in Germany.</p><p>They became American citizens because he was naturalized as an American. I still have at home a fantastic picture where you see the old man all dressed up, you know, on the day that he became an American citizen. That must have been a glorious day in his life. Anyhow, from that moment the family was American. They were American citizens, but residing in Germany.</p><p>Now when the war started, the first World War, they of course, as American citizens, had to leave Germany, go to a neutral country. So they went to Denmark. And they stayed throughout the war years in Denmark. And they had a couple of beautiful daughters and they were very respected in the community. And after the war they returned to Litic(ph), but they left the kind of impression on the Danish community here. So when my father came of age and was supposed to find a wife to settle down, some people in the community,"well, ==--=--=--------------saa very nice family from Litic(ph) and they had two beautiful daughters, go and take a look." So my father went, went to Litic(ph), and that must have been 1925 or 6 and they married and my mother joined, of course, my father in Copenhagen. And that is how, how a nuclear family so to say, came to Denmark. One from Russia, one from Poland, by America and Litic(ph) and they settled down in Copenhagen. I was born in 1927. This is more or less the origin of the family. In 1933 they left the rest of the family, my grandparents and left Litic(ph) and they immigrated to America where some of their boys already <span class="page-break" number="16"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0 "taub," t-a-u-b. This was more, I just want to say one funny thing about my grandfather on my mother's side. He was very, very strict and stubborn. He's remembered as a disciplinary in the family. One of these autocratic, patriotic types, who could never do wrong, and if he ever did do wrong, he could never admit it. My mother told me one particular case, he was supposed to go some place in Europe from Litic (ph) the family took him to the train and they waved at him good-bye and he sat down and they were very , they were very unemotional. So they never stood in the window of the train waving good-bye, they simply, when they put out the window and took out the newspaper they could on the platform, you know, looking <span class="page-break" number="17"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 1 education and succeed. They wanted you quickly to join, to join the rush. So they put you in the best school available.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And Jews were allowed in any of those schools?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Of course, Denmark was, since the Jews got citizenship, they were totally equal there. Of course there were Danes who didn't like Jews but there was not anti-Semitism in Denmark. I always distinguish between societies where you have anti-Semites and societies where you have anti-Semitism. In Denmark you have anti-Semites, the individuals but you never had a trend or a movement of this kind. Even the Nazis when they formed a political party were very weak on the anti-Semitic stuff because they knew that this would reject some of their potential followers.</p><p>You know, Jewish-Denmark for the last 150 years had been, there's been a kind of, you know, what do you call, these tries(ph) children pay(ph) within circuses, you know up and down, up and down mountain rides, you know, you had...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You mean a roller coaster?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: A roller coaster, that's right, sorry, a roller coaster. You had immigration, then the people who were after acclimatized(ph), they assimilated within a couple of generations. The Jews almost were extinguished as community, then a new wave of immigrants came; so came up and down, up and down. Today we hadn't had an immigration in 1969 of Polish-Jews, a couple thousand Pol-Jews, the Danish community, the Jewish community would be very, very weak because similar to what happened in some of the states of America. You have a integration rate or assimilation rate or intermarriage rate, call it what you want for more than 50, 60 percent. So if no more Jews will arrive in Denmark or the next generation than the two Jew races, the two other year, two other century old history of Danish Jews would more or less be concluded.</p></p></dialogue>

I walked to Synagogue every Saturday an hour walk with my father. Later of course, the chief Rabbi realized that he had to choose either between letting the Jews take the tram or the subway to Synagogue, or they wouldn't go to synagogue. So they released the Jews, from the Jews to walk, and he permitted them under the condition that they had bought tickets the day before, he permitted them to drive to Synagogue. By this, so to say, he saved the community from extinction. At any rate, | remember I was not supposed to go to school on the holidays or on the .

At that time, already, lots of individual initiatives were taken. There was no coordinating rule for organization. But the moment the people, non- Jews realized that the Jews were in danger, than all kinds of initiatives were taken by individuals, by groups of people, by priests, by hospitals and so on. So, this particular case, whenever they met a Jewish family, there were many Jewish families in this area here, especially poorer Jewish families because it was at that time before the war restrictive, not so, no quality housing, I would say to put it mildly. So they had been told, if you find a Jewish couple, tell them immediately to take a taxi and go to Bespepyau(ph), Bespepyau Hospital, where they would be offered hospitality and put into hiding. One place he found another friend student of his a student, a fellow of his and they said, well it can't be, you know, that's how the Jewish reaction was to the unintelligible.

The story is that night we stayed with our friends, we couldn't stay more than one night at one place because, you know. Now we know in retrospect that the Germans acted totally different than they acted in other occupied countries. But we had to prepare for the worst, so we had to make all kinds of decisions because we believed that this was a serious matter for the Germans. Now we know that they were all common interest in the German camp which enabled us to escape to Sweden, but it's quite obvious that half the Germans acted with the same will power. The same, the same organizational talent which they used in prosecuting, persecuting Jews in other countries. Of course they would have caught us, but we didn't know so we had to act as if...by the way this is also true for the Danes. After the war there was the inclination to say, well anyhow the Danes are not such great heroes, but the of the Danes were caught, those few that were caught got two or three weeks of prison by the Danish authorities. You know, we still had Danish courts, we didn't have German courts. Looking at most of the Jews, only 500 were arrested, the rest were .

<dialogue class=""><p> 5</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They captured about 5 hundred and about 6,500 came over. Now in our case, we shifted from the first hiding place to another. We went down the coast. This was like animals do looking for escape routes. You go by the smell, you know, and you go by instinct you went down to the coast because the only place that you could hide, along the coast and hope to be able to get to the only place that might receive you and protect you was Sweden. And the sound(ph) between Denmark and Sweden is not very wide, but it recovered by the distance from the Danish coast to Sweden territory water could be covered by a quick boat in less than half an hour. But it was beyond our imagination. There lies Denmark which is hidden in the darkness and just across this narrow sound was neutral Sweden with lights and with chocolate and bananas and what not. But</p><p> began to realize that there were people who were able to live another kind of life that we were. But we went down to the coast hoping that we could escape this way of course and hapbeny(ph), the Swedish government who had, by the way, not been welcoming to Romney refugees in 42's and early 43 issued a declaration during these H days welcoming all Jews saying that they could come to Swedish protection. The fact is that the Swedish not only made statements to that effect, but they also acted accordingly because Swedish patrol boats from the navy went out took the Swedish to the borderline and the moment that Danish boats crossed this borderline the Swedish boats immediately came to protect them. So that in case that Germans, I mean, you had to account for all . Incase a German patrol boat would <span class="page-break" number="22"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 6 was real, this was for real, you didn't use a telephone, you didn't speak to any strangers, you're afraid of moving on the roads because you were afraid of ending up in the arms of German patrol, there were Germans all over the place, soldiers mainly. Only later we know that the army decided not to interfere, not to take part in the acts against the Jews. So the German army for its own reasons of interest did not allow for the Jews, wanted to protect the Jews, but simply for its own interests the German army only had one case that's known to have participated in this anti- Jewish action. This was left to the police and the, what do you call it, the visheyesteins(ph), the what the German counter intelligence, whatever it is the, Estit(ph), it's called Estit(ph). So the very fact that the army was all around didn't interfere. This we couldn't have known either. So we took hiding at this place and one night he had negotiated with another fisherman to take us across to Sweden. We were told that late at night to move across the coastal road and go down to the beach and wait under a small bridge to be picked up. We were standing there freezing, my parents, my father, my mother and my three sisters and brother and we heard the doc(ph), doc(ph), doc, doc [sound of approaching boat], of the fishing boat approaching the docks of course the lights are on us. I mean today we're sitting in a warm room, this thing 50 years behind us, it's difficult to imagine a family all on its own alone, without any protection standing on a small wooden bridge looking into the water waiting for the doc, doc, doc, doc to come to pick them up. But anyhow, the boat appears from the darkness and we are all already to jump at the boat and it simply passed by and it went to a bridge where another Jewish family was waiting and picked them up and off it went to Sweden. Of course we never learned what the reason was, maybe these people could have paid them more money, maybe it was a mistake. I don't know, but we were standing out there in the darkness without any alternative. So we returned to the fisherman and we really did not, my father was responsible for the family. These were times when the fathers felt responsible, he didn't know what to do, we all relied on the fisherman getting some kind of connection which we could use in order to get out. Another night we spent at a large white house with lots of other refugees sitting in the dark sitting room, living room and the specification, the student organization, while rowing us over, rowing, can you imagine,</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And I remember that when our turn came, the guy who was supposed to row us over, this would take hours, I mean you could go by quick boat for 30 minutes, but to be rowed over by one man that was very heavy(ph) going, two hours, and going for more than one trip was very difficult, but these were in the days that when the crisis was really on these were the nice ones that knew that the Jewish were looking for us...</p></p></dialogue>
