<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And please describe Lienzingen to me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Lienzingen was the first camp, and we worked, they took us several kil-kilomers, we had to walk to a place, a zoological garden. There was no animals, we were the animals actually, and we dug ditches. They measured up so many -- so many feet th- the lengths, so many feet the widths, and so many feet the depth. And you have to do it through -- through the day. Day in and day out, the same thing, may -- we dug those di-ditches. And it was terrible, very, very bad. And they told us, this is the last week, and we going to go to another place, going to be much nicer, the food will be better, everything will be better, and the -- we're going to go -- they're going to ship us to Germany. And I didn't like it, to go Germany, I didn't like it at all. So I didn't tell anybody in the camp, my friends, that I made up my mind I'm not going to go, I going to escape. Well, I mean -- and so --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Um, before we get to that, let's talk a little bit more about the conditions in -- in Lienzingen. Did you sleep in a barracks?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah, there was -- there wasn't a barracks yet, and it was like a -- like a -- like herrings, one on top, next to each other, th-the bunks, like, you know? And the -- and I mean, it was -- was very bad. And that's frightened, more than anything else, to go to Germany. | figure, well I was born in Poland, I might as well die there, I don't want</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="14"></span> </p><p> Interview with Felix Nicinski .</p><p>March 6, 2007 to go to Germany. And th-they told us, this is the last week, and we're going to go away to Germany. | did make up my mind, I'm not going to go. And I did escape from the -- from the place I was working, and they knew right away that I escape, because you have to line up for a roll call, and they were looking for me, I no -- I knew that. And I took a chance, a big chance. I think my mind didn't work right, if anybody with -- with the right mind, will not do what I did to escape. And the reason for that is, some of them did escape, but they caught them in no time. And th -- when they caught them in a Mo-Monday or Tuesday, or a Thursday, or whatever day was, they put them -- th-they brought them back to their camp to wh-where he escaped, and Sunday they brought them out on roll call, everybody was there lined up. They brought them up, they brought a portable gallow, and he was hanged. So I knew what's going to happen when -- when they catch me. But I made up my mind, I -- I blanked out, you know, I didn't think about that, and I was lucky, very extremely lucky they didn't catch me. So I went from pillar to post, like the saying goes, knock on the door, beg for a piece of bread. Some -- some women, some people offered to give me a piece of bread, others slammed the door in my face. Get -- get the hell out of here, dirty Jew. They knew right -- right away I was Jewish. So after awhile, if I had somebody with me, I would probably wind out in the -- in the forest, but by myself didn't know where to go, how to go. So, I was -- and I knew at the college, there was -- there were Jews there, and there was a ghetto there, I knew that. So took me days, weeks, maybe several months,</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="15"></span> Interview with Felix Nicinski " March 6, 2007 little by little I got into the city, to college, and little kids were playing [indecipherable] ball there, and I went and talked to them, and I said, I understand the Jews live here, they call it the ghetto or something, can you show me where it is? So one boy is pulling on the other, don't talk to him, th-the -- it's prohibit and you can't go there. You cannot go there, and the only -- the one of them said come, I'll show you. He went with me and from a distance I saw already th-th-the fence, you know.</p><p>And -- and I went there, and -- and I was walking close by. And there was a gate there, the gate was open, the chain was hanging down, and the Germans, the Nazis were going back and forth. One was going this way, the other one was going this way, and they meet. And the -- and the gate was open [indecipherable] down, when there's s -- when they start talking, I crossed over and I smuggle myself in. They luckily didn't notice me. But who noticed me? The Jewish police. Wh-What th -- they have a black uniform with the nightstick, and armband, dai politsi, police, and that's all they had.</p><p>So they grabbed me, and they start talking in Polish to me, what right do you have to -- to smuggle yourself into the ghetto, in Polish. I says -- and I talk back in Yiddish. And they couldn't believe, because oh, the kid was born probably amongst the Jews there, th-the -- ye -- you know, with Jew -- where a lot of Jewish live, and he picked up some Jewish, he is not Jewish. And I tried to talk to him, I'm Jewish, I'm Jewish, no, no.</p><p>They took me in a room there and I said, I can tell you I'm Jewish because there come a transport from Kalish and there were some -- a couple of doctors there. Dr. Cohen  <span class="page-break" number="16"></span> ontactrefiranneGaushariarg a hither atrmedortabeattfiexaliaton</p><p> Interview with Felix Nicinski * March 6, 2007 was one of them. Then another one, but I couldn't -- I couldn't remember the other one, and they said to me [indecipherable] saying the other, well the kid is talking sense because they shipped out some people with the Dr. Cohen, somebody else, anyway. So they said, okay, what is your name? They wrote down the letters Fievish Nicinski and then they wrote in big letters too, your name is Bahardian Elias, born [indecipherable]. And I was the age -- they make the age like 27 years old. So -- so we g -- we going to check with you. We not tell you when, tomorrow, next day, whatever it is. You're not going to take out a piece of paper, you have to memorize the name in where was you -- where was you born. So I recognized that [indecipherable] that I had tried to memorize all this, and they took me in next day, what is your name?</p><p>So I have to tell them Bahardian [indecipherable] this and that. And then I learned from the others, that the guy like this escaped. They didn't notify the -- the German authority, so they got a special ration of whatever the -- you know, bread and milk, whatever it was. They didn't -- they didn't tell the German that he escaped. So I took his name. And so from there, one fine night they circled the ghetto, raus, raus, raus, out, out, out. And they took us to another ghetto, Lodz. Lithmanstadt. They call it Ledz, Ledz ghetto. There I was, and I worked there, I worked there hard. There was a -- a press, I was ironing, ironing uniforms, SS, Gestapo uniforms. And they told me, you have to be extremely, extremely careful. Don't let any spot come out and make holes in it, because that's very dangerous. You -- you pay a big penalty for that. The  <span class="page-break" number="17"></span>  Interview with Felix Nicinski a March 6, 2007 irons weren't like it is here, electric. They were born -- burn -- burn wood, like, used to be, you know? And heated up the irons. And that's how it was. And from there they took me to a camp near Skarzysko-Kamienna. That was the biggest Polish ammunition factory.</p><p>End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Felix Nicinski.
