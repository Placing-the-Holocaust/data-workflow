<dialogue class=""><p>Well thanks for doing this interview today.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, you're welcome.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: We're sitting in your house in Sheboygan, Wisconsin. It's a little bit warm, so we have the windows open, in case you hear a little bit of traffic outside, or kids playing, or whatever. A lot of kids playing on the streets around here.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Sorry, couldn't predict the weather.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's okay, no problem. Let me just have you say your name, and where we are today.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- on -- on video.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, I did.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So, in our interview today, we're not going to go over as much of your wartime experiences, as you have in those videos, those are --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Mm-hm.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- pretty complete. So -- But what we want to do today is talk about what's been happening to you since the war. And I'm just trying to think of a good place to pick up.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>You've told the story of the day of liberation --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- and you were in Bergen-Belsen --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Mm-hm.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- concentration camp. And, you know, one question I had, which you didn't talk about specifically in these interviews, is the final days of the war, the conditions in the camp were just deplorable. And you and your sister --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- and two friends --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- were keeping yourselves alive with one potato.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, but we also came -- we came to Bergen-Belsen, having a li -- a portion of bread from Hamburg, from a -- from a so-called labor camp. But this labor camp was a sub-</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And it -- Neuengamme was an extermination camp, everybody knows that, but somehow we got transported to Bergen-Belsen, with this piece of bread yet. So we ate first this bread, and then this potato, but it was just impossible to -- you know, we were losing our strength, and could barely walk. So, it is true that we stayed alive with one potato, I don't know by what miracle we did stay alive, but like I said, to the end, we couldn't walk any more. Went in in the barrack to lay down, and to die. This is when liberation came. I was really also sick with typhoid fever, but I had sort of the walking around typhoid fever. I wasn't that severe, my sister was. She had to be taken away to a hospital, and she was very, very ill. When -- When she got well, I could hardly recognize her. She looked worse than the people that were dead in the camp. But somehow, you see, we survived, and we didn't find anyone of our family. It was very heartbreaking, and at this point it seems pointless to live. There was nothing to go on for.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: On the -- On the -- the actual day of liberation, as you talked about in your video interviews, you had actually, I guess, gone into the barracks, and y-you --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Gave up.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You were going to die?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. Yes, we did. And one of my friends, she -- she wanted to -- to just walk out, and sort of a last farewell look at the camp, and came back and told us that was funny things going on out there. I just said, "Forget it. You hallucinating," you know. "Let me die in peace." She kept on nudging, and my sister went out. I don't know where my sister got the strength to come back and grab me by my arm, and tell me, "Get up, you have to see</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

It was unbelievable. I just didn't think I was alive. No, it was impossible. I thought I died.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you think it was some sort of dream?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, sort of like I was watching, you know, this isn't really happening to me. I don't know. But it was real enough, and we were liberated by the English army. It was heartbreaking though, that so many people, those living pe -- skeletons that couldn't walk any more, you know, getting bread, and couldn't make use of it any more, because that too late for them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You know?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: The -- The question I had about all this, because you have talked about this in -- at some length in your other interviews, is if the British hadn't come right then, if an allied -</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Mm-hm.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- military force had not arrived somewhere in that period --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Mm-hm.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- to liberate the camp, do you have any notion how much longer you might have lived?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Maybe a day or two. Because maybe I wouldn't be starved to that point of dying, but I completely gave up, because I thought there was no other way. There's nothing left.</p><p>Sooner or later, we all will be dead. This is the end of it. So, just giving up on everything.</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Nowhere to turn. There -- There -- Outside the barbed wire, there was kohlrabi -- I probably mentioned that too, the piles kohlrabi that were decomposed, that people there still risking their lives to get one of those squash things, a smelly things to eat.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What are those? Kohlrabi, what -- what is it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It's like -- What can I say? It's a thing that you used to feed animals. And I know it was -- in Europe it's called kohlrabi, I don't know how to translate this into English, up to this day, I don't know. But that's supposed to have been the people's food. It was warm in April, you know. The sun was beating down on that. The kohlrabi was decomposed. People were risking their lives, actually, trying to get one, and they were shot. They were shot to death, almost on the minute of liberation, because they were so desperate to get this. But I was never one of the brave, to go and risk like that. I was a very timid girl, and I -- I would say the honest truth, my sister was the organizer. If it wouldn't be for her, maybe I wouldn't be alive, because she worked in a different place, where she had more access to food. And she always used to smuggle into the camp, some of it for me, which was a great help.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: After all that you had been through for all those years --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- and all that happened to you, why is it at this particular time -- you say you had given up?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes.</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: No, just before. You said you had, you know --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because I could see that there was no hel -- no help coming from nowhere. Nothing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>Where do we go? Surrounded by barbed wire and dead corpses. And you walked around, and -- and people were just dying right in front of you. What was waiting for us? The same thing, you know? So it's just -- you might as well, sooner or later, because there's no other way.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But you had -- didn't you have indications that the Germans were losing the war at that point?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yes, we know that. We know they were losing the war, especially when I was in Hamburg, then we were still working there on the streets, you know? Th-The fliers, the Allied fliers, they were coming three, four, five times a day, and we worked there. Like it says in my interview, next to a radar station, we could hear that radar turning and beeping, and the sirens going on. They were here. We could -- We could hear the bombs flying, and everything. And the city of Hamburg was one rubble on top of the other.</p><p>That's the way it looked. So we knew no -- no country in condition -- in condition like that could win a war. It was impossible for them. But the question was, are we -- are we - - will we be able to live -- to be -- survive this? That was the question.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you talk much with your sister or your other friends there about how the war was going, and -- and how long you thought it would be before it ended, before it was over?</p></p></dialogue>

It -- We were so absorbed in trying, first to survive from day to day.</p><p>We did not see a tomorrow. That's what it was, just trying to survive every day as it came.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So things like what was happening in Hamburg with the bombings, and the --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- other things you saw, they were sort of -- you would see them, but it was almost like that was kind of the -- the background --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes, it --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- to just staying alive.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- it wasn't touching us, just this is it, you know?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Mm-hm. This may sound like a silly question, but how long can four people make one potato last? You --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Would you --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You talk about this one potato.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Would you believe that? We made it last almost three or four days, just eating -- you could look through that slice when we were eating. I don't know w-what kept us going. I honestly don't know. People say, oh, you were destined. God was watching over you, that you should survive and be able to tell that story. I really don't know what forces kept us alive. It's just impossible to tell.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Before you started eating it, how big was the potato? Do you remember?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, I would say it was quite a nice size, you know?</p><p>This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Oh, okay, so, you know --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: How she found it, I don't know. I say it was a miracle.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. It must have taken a lot of willpower not to eat more of it, at once.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes, it did, but it seems like we were always the ones that had this willpower. When we went to work, we got our portion of bread in the morning, some people ate it right away, they were so hungry. We were also the same way hungry, but my sister and I, my friends, we never ate the whole portion, we always divided it, because I wanted to have the reassurance that I have something to eat for later. We knew nothing else was coming.</p><p>St -- On the -- On the bowshtella we -- we never got anything unless we worked -- one time -- you worked for a couple weeks in a village across the Elba. The village was called Kronst, and we were loading bricks on a boat. But that was also -- you had to be lucky to be picked for this. You see, we were fighting -- everybody was fighting to go to the village, because the local people brought food for us, and there was more to eat, so it was a great big fight in the morning to get first in line, to be picked for this place. We were always divided in different working groups. Most of the time, a majority of the time, I was in Hamburg, cleaning the streets.</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Those were -- They're volunteer militias from the Ukraine, Lithuane, and Hungary, and they -- they had white armbands, we could see that. And those people were still shooting at us, when the people tried to get those kohlrabi, you know? I can't understand their logic, and their way of thinking.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In those final days, were there still any sort of selections going on?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That had stopped?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Chaos. It was nothing. Not where we were. You see, Bergen-Belsen, were like several camps together, divided. That much I know, because if -- we were with others, but not -- I didn't even know that children survived there, in certain places. We di -- We didn't know that, because we were not together with these people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So in the end it really wasn't -- the killing that was going on in the camp was not the -- the organized systematic killing, but it --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- but things were still happening.</p></p></dialogue>

People were just dying, because they didn't feed -- s -- the people that were there previously, they probably weren't fed for the longest time already. So, that was just like -- they were self- destructing, they didn't have to do anything.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: When the British came into the camp, and one of your friends came in and told you to take a look, and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- you started to see these scenes, and you weren't sure if you were dreaming, or if it was real, again you've talked about all that in your video interview. Do you remember your first contact with any of the -- the British soldiers?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not -- Well, we -- they ge -- they handed out food. This is all I ru -- I remember, being close in contact. I also watched them later, right away film that liberation. They were putting it on film. And I know there is a video of it, it's called liberation of Bergen- Belsen. This is exactly what they did, right away. And next thing I know, when we were sort of already settled, and they came in -- I don't know, they must have been Scotchmen, or whatever, they came in with their bagpipes and skirts, you know. And I was sitting on -- on the curb, and I looked up, and that's the first time I've seen a man dressed like that, in a skirt, and I just laughed so hard, I could hardly catch my breath, cause I didn -- never saw anything like it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember what you and your sister said to each other in the first moments, when you realized what was going on?</p></p></dialogue>

Not enough doctors, and do you know, the German population from around, they were forced to come into the camp and see all this. And the English needed help with the sick people, those nurses, the local nurses didn't even want to come in, they had to be brought in at gunpoint. They didn't want to come and help the sick people. It took me a long time to find my sister in those buildings. I didn't know where they took her. Finally I found her, and there she was on the floor laying and holding a -- a rag with cold water to her head, and she said, last night the doctor said to her -- he looked at her, and he said, "This woman has the crisis tonight. If she's al -- If she survives, she'll be alive tomorrow morning." She said, "I didn't sleep a whole night, I wanted to die with my eyes open." Here I come in the morning, and thank God she was alive. Then they first started giving her medication. Medication was so scarce that they only gave it to people they thought would survive. That was the case of it.</p></p></dialogue>

I don't know how to translate it any other way, that's what it was. My father's name was Israel. I had two more brothers. One of them was called in Yiddish, Smaul Hirsch, and the other one, Yankel David. And we all came from the Lodz ghetto into Auschwitz, and this is what happened to them, they never got out of there.</p></p></dialogue>

They were -- My mother was with us when they were selecting the people, they just took her right to the left side. And my two brothers and my father, we didn't know for sure, but then we met a gentleman that was in the ghetto, a neighbor, and he was behind them in line, and he told us that they went the wrong way, so there was no way we could find anybody any more.</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

So everyone looked for -- not finding a relative, everybody looked for companionship, for someone to lean on.

You know? And we lived in Feldifing, in a little room, it was down -- actually, it was called the basement. There were bunkbeds, and the four of us lived there. We were still together. So, my friend that was looking for Finkelstein, he used to come down there, and he used to bring some friends along, and this is where we met, there were also, like places -- you know, the Americans organized dance halls, they wanted people to have some fun. They also brought movies into the camp, and we had traveling survivor's orchestras giving concerts.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, that didn't work that way, because there wasn't enough room in the camps. It was like one big room, and somehow, they gave us some boards, and divide it into a wall, and on the other side another couple lived, and on this side, we lived. And this is the way it worked.

And my husband, after awhile they used to get some German marks from the German government, like from the state where we were, Bavarian state, they used to get some German marks, because they sort of were on a pilung of a police department, or whatever they called it, after awhile. And in the beginning, there was no -- no talk of anything, because we still tried to figure out where are we, what do we supposed to be doing?

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, Jewish thinking is always, you have to have a namesake, you have to have someone to remember.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They ver -- very sort of anxious emotions, because she was also sickly child, because I was not in perfect health, and I always watched her and carried her to the doctor, and I put her -- I didn't have a bed, she slept in her buggy, or whatever. And I sat -- half the nights, I used to sit by that buggy and watch her, and when she moved her fingers, or moved her head, I considered, oh what a miracle, this is mine, you know, my own, no one can ever take this away from me. And it was -- most of the time when I looked at her, I cried. It was a miracle to me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you see having children somehow, as you know, being a small part in, sort of, so many Jews had been taken from the earth, and sort of helping to bring them back?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Maybe, in a way, I would say that the Jewish people do not disappear completely, and well, just for myself, I wanted, as a parent, to have a child.

This is where they had their -- all the in -- and we had to go -- would you believe, we all had to go through a very true screening. They had to make sure that we were who we were, and we were in the concentration camps. Somehow they couldn't find my husband's background, so he had to travel in Germany, to this place called Arelson, and bring the papers from there, ca -- so they ma -- make sure that he is who he is. It was so ironical, now that I think of it, how many Nazis went through, that had no problems at all, and us, the survivors, they made so many problems, trying to -- and one time, the second time when we went for a hearing before the INS, they were called, he asked me where I worked, you know? I said, in ha -- all the questions where I di -- wa -- the most work. I said, "In Hamburg." "Whereabouts in Hamburg?" See? And when I told him, he says, "Oh, yeah, I know the place, I was there."

And they had -- in May they had a May day parade, and because he has a -- was a policeman, they assumed he knows who these people were, and he should give them names of those Bundists.

He didn't know. You know, they had 24 hour duty. After he came home from duty, he slept most of the time, because he was tired. He was not in any social integration there, no one was. We always tried to see where we -- what we wanted to do. So, he had no political interest, neither did I at that time. Of course, our sympathies were -- were with Israel, at that time Palestine, but none of us were inclined to be Communist, or left, or whatever it was.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Eventually, because when we came again to be interviewed, there was this lady, the secretary, and she was marry -- married to a Polish guy, to a real Polish guy, and I got to talk to her, and then I said to her, what was happening. And she got really upset. She went into this interviewer, and said to him, "It's strange that these poor people are being held back, and you know they have nothing, they're poor, and they're survivors .All they want to do is get out of here, and you holding them back, and you let go any Tom, Dick and Harry which is not Jewish, you letting them go."

And you know what happened? The day we were going to go -- before the -- the date that we were going on the boat, they checked the children, agenamy -- again, and my daughter had a temperature. Could you believe that? I sat up all night and cried, and gave her aspirins, and in the morning they checked her again. Well, the temperature had gone, so they let me go on t-the boat. And let me tell you, all 10 days we traveled, on stormy seas, I thought I'd never survive that. I'm never going on another boat again. And then the -- finally pulled in, and New York harbor, it quiet down, you know? And then my husband -- of course we were not together, we traveled on a military boat, so the men were separate, and the women were separate, and because I had a small baby, I was privileged to have a cabin with another woman, separate, private. So, he came into the cabin, and if it wouldn't be for him, I think my child would die of s-starvation, cause I couldn't lift my head from that bunk. So he came in, and he said, "Oh, it's so quiet now." We have to come out on deck and see what was going on. If you -- I went out, and it was the most gorgeous sight I've seen. It was at dawn, you know, it's still dark outside. I could see the lit up harbor, and the first thing, bright, and white lit up, was the Statue of Liberty.

And then we were met by representative, either they were UNRRA, or Joint, I don't know. This is what they call themself for short, I can't really tell you exactly how to say the whole name of them. And they took us to a hotel, we stayed in the hotel for several days to rest up. Actually, they wanted to send us to Trenton, New Jersey, but my sister's destination was in Sheboygan. So she wanted very much for us to be together, and asked the local people here to intervene, so they would send us here. So we came here. So they -- in New York they gave us tickets and put us on a train, and they put us on a passenger -- on a coach passenger train, you know, with a little baby, traveling all overnight, sitting on a bench. She -- I didn't know where to lay her down, she cried all night. And people were sitting, and -- and I didn't know a word of English, or -- or whatever, and I was still very much a timid person out of a camp, looking around, being afraid these people are going to scream at me because my child is crying.

We didn't have a lot of opportunities here. They have a small committee here, they welc-welcomed us, and because my sister was here, they didn't even find us an apartment right away, we had to stay with my sister. They gave my husband a job, and as far as looking for a place, we had to do that ourselves. My husband job didn't earn nothing, you know?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Just a factory job. Well, we had no education. There was no one here that said, "Well, we'll -- we'll see that you get an education and meanwhile see that you have something to live on." Nobody did this here. So we had to right away go to work, and because his earnings weren't enough, I had to go sometimes and help out. What could I do? There was nothing part time I could do in the evening, just babysit or clean somebody's house, that was it. But then my children got bigger, and I went to work too, full-time, because they were both in school. So I went full-time to work.</p></p></dialogue>

We did all the adjusting all by ourselves. Soon as we got a job, nobody bothered with us. That was it, you got a job, you're making money, you got to do it on your own.

It helped though, in the beginning, that you could speak the language, you know, and communicate. But then we communicated and they said, "If you understand something in English, then say it. We" ll help you." You know? We went for awhile to vocational school. It wasn't a great big help, it wasn't, because when you don't know the language, and people start the grammar, and you don't even know what is a vowel, or a noun, or whatever it is, what good is it to you? I had learned a lot from watching my neighbor's TV, seeing the motions, and the repeat -- repeated words, and I also liked to read a lot. I started reading, I actually didn't know what I was reading, because the pronunciations here are so different. But slowly I got it, and on my own, more on our own, we did it.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Why do you think that happened, was it just sort of accidental?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [have no idea. I think the people here, themself, weren't that well off before the war.</p><p>The war gave them opportunities to better themself, and maybe they were busy themself, trying to get somewhere. They were just so absorbed in their trying to make it, that they had no time for anybody else. That's the only way I can figure.</p></p></dialogue>

[ have a note here, this is from the museum that I -- I guess maybe you mentioned this in wa -- one of your other interviews that you had, most of your friends here were not Jewish, and it says that you said you think that's the way it should be, and they want to know what do you mean by that?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I said that. Well, because I think we need to communicate with people other than Jewish people. I had a great need to understand about other religions, and about other places, because in Europe we were completely isolated from that. And I learned a great deal from my friends, they learned a great deal from me. And we you learn to respect one another, because of that, and it doesn't matter what religion they are really, we are always good friends.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- during this period, did they ask you much about what happened to you during the war, did you talk about it much?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Some of them did. And some of them said, "Don't talk about it now, it hurts too much.</p><p>Maybe later on." And finally, I don't know how -- it started with me talking. Do you want me to talk about that? I don't know, do you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Sure. Sure, go ahead.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, there was a time when they were speculating about Dr. Mengele, because he was the one in Auschwitz, doing all the experiments, if he was still alive, and that was in 1985, where that was a big uproar all over the world, trying to figure out where he is, or what's going on. And the local paper here, wanted to write a story tying in some one of the survivors with Mengele. The only one that was in Auschwitz here, was I. So someone directed a newspaper lady to me. She came and interviewed me, and we talked. I did tell her that Mengele met every transport, or, at that time, I wouldn't know who he was. But I'm sure he was there. So she took my life story, she wrote a big article, and she said, "Tt'll be in the paper." Made headlines, you know, it made -- the next day it made headlines, and I started getting phone calls from schools. The first school was in Howard's Grove here, that asked me to come and speak. The teacher -- And I said to her, "T don't feel like coming. I have never spoken in public, and I really -- are you sure you want me to come?" So she said, "Of course."

I was shaking in my boots. But from then on, apparently I did something right, because she keeps on asking me to come back every year. From then on I keep on going. And from then on, from word of mouth, other schools, and it gets to be more and more every year. So, that's the way it happens with me going out and speaking.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How often do you do it now?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Soon as school starts, I get phone calls, and I would say in an average, about five times a month, for sure. But sometimes it's even more.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: These are grammar schools, high schools?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Universities, high schools, grammar schools, junior highs, everything. Also church groups, organizations, and civic clubs, all of them. I found many of those.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: 1 -- I -- 1 -- I do my presentation, mainly the story of my life. I start out just with a little introduction, and then I talk about myself, and through the liberation. And if it's a school, then I talk to them about life here, and what they have here, how they should -- comparing my life, and how I view the United States when I came here, what we have here, and how appreciative they should be, and really appreciate the life and the schools, and everything they have. And point out all these hate groups to them, try to make them understand that before they commit themself to something like that, they should study, and check out the archives and documents, to make sure what is the truth.

So, and then there's always a period of questions, of look it up, this picture there, where all these children are? You see that? That was on a school where about 50 of them crowded around, wanted my autograph.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You say make a p -- a presentation, what kinds of things do you tell them about? Do you tell them about being in the camps, and what you saw, and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- "m also curious how they react. Have -- Have they heard much of this before, or -- or are they sort of in the dark about this to start with?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, some of them get -- take a unit in it beforehand, before I come, so they will be -- they have some background on it. Most of them do. And they prepare questions ahead of time, which I -- after I'm through, I do answer questions for those children, and they are - - I get tons of letters from them, and when I read those, I can see that they paid attention, because they quote me sometimes, and telling me how appreciative they are that now that they listened to my story, and that they will never say they're hungry again, or they will never say that they're underprivileged because they don't have certain things, and how lucky they are to live in freedom. Thanking me for coming and telling my story and calling me a hero for surviving, and maybe that was my goal, that I would be able to come and tell people about this, so people finally realize that we -- we should not hate one another. This is the most important thing I tell them, that hate is a terrible thing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When you talk to them about what happened, do they seem very shocked? Do -- Do they ever have trouble believing that this type of thing actually happens, or --</p></p></dialogue>

Because what reason, or what would I get out of it, coming here and telling a story like that? So they say, "We are very much convinced now." Doubters, you know? And I think what makes me feel good is those responses, and what makes me more feel good is that after walking somewhere in the street, or walking into a store, when a person comes over and says, I heard you speak five years ago in this school, and she still can recognize my face, and remembers what I said, that's the biggest reward a person can get.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So do some of the students actually say to you, I did have doubts that the Holocaust happened, or --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Not very many. Very seldom someone will say that, yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How does it come up? Do they say that they looked into it and wondered if it happened, or -- I'm just curious where this sort of line of thought comes from.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Some of them say, "I have a friend that says that's not true, it never happened. But you're here, you told me that. I can see it's true." So.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm. Let's go back to sort of your -- your family history again.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I tell you, my older daughter graduated in social work. She did that for a couple of years and decided it was too heartbreaking, and too hard. She did not want that.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What -- What was it like when they were growing up, regarding the fact that you and your husband were Holocaust survivors? How much did you talk about it with your children, and how did you handle that whole situation?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I did not tell them a lot when they were much younger. The only thing that I always instilled in them, that we are all people, and it doesn't matter who we are, everybody is a friend, if they're nice people. And they were like that, they made easy friends with non-Gentiles, and gen -- and -- and Jewish people. My kids had tons of friends coming to this place. They had a bedroom, very little room, because this is what we could afford, and the room was small, it -- as a matter of fact, it had bunk beds, because I couldn't fit in two beds.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, we just tried to tell them that -- we had to tell them, you know, because they used to ask about grandparents, other relatives. So this is what came out. That's what we had to tell them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: They would ask where their relatives were, or why they didn't have them?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Of course. Why do -- Why don't they have a grandma? Why don't they have a-aunt -- more aunts, just one aunt, and one uncle, where other children they associate with have big families, and cousins a lot, and so you have to tell them. Not when they were real little, they wouldn't understand that.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What about you yourself, when it would come up? Did -- Would you prefer not to think about it, or not to be reminded of it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, in the beginning, none of us really wanted to talk a lot about it, because it brought a lot of heartache. It still does. It -- That will never go away, as long as we will live, never. Beca -- It's hard to reconcile yourself that the war starts, and you're a 13 year old girl, and the war ends, and you're an adult on your own, and there's no one to turn to for advice, what to do, how -- what to do with your life, or how to -- to associate with people, or whatever. So it's very hard. My young years are gone, from childhood into adulthood. It's -- It -- It is -- A lot of the people can't understand that, what we missed out on.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you think that -- obviously, you know, in many ways it's a good experience, do you think that it's been a good thing that you've become a bit of a public speaker about the Holocaust? Has that helped you in any way, sort of sort things out, or deal with it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, La -- I'm very gratified that I do something good, I think I'm doing something -- bringing a little understanding to children, and some adults. And believe me, some 0 -- some of the adults, which I'm very shocked, until I come, say they never heard of it.</p><p>Would you believe that? I had one college girl come over and say she never heard of the Holocaust until I came and spoke there. This is gratifying, very much so, and another thing, I think is -- when you speak about it, it's just like therapy, talking it out. At -- It feels like I'm talking my heartache out, and after that it makes me feel I'm a little more calm, because of that. It gives me a better feeling, trying to make people understand what was it like.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you read much about the Holocaust, and what about films, and documentaries, and that sort of thing?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [have tons of books on that subject, and documentaries, I have several. Also, I went to see "Schindler's List," of course, and there's a lando -- on PBS, there's a lot of documentaries.

Do you think that you saw things one way before the war, and it was drastically different afterward, or what -- what's that been like for you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, as a Jewish person, before the war, I knew -- like I said, I knew I wasn't equal to the others, because I wasn't treated that way, but I always felt I was, in myself. It wa -- It was instilled into me by my parents, that we are good people, and we did not do anything wrong, it's just too bad that other people can't recognize that. But when I came here, I rejoiced in all this freedom, I also look very cautiously on everything, because of the things that I went through. I'm always a little skeptical, and afraid. I'm still afraid, because of what's happening with -- with this mushrooming groups of hate, what is going to happen? And if they wouldn't someday prevail. This is what bothers me a lot.</p></p></dialogue>

But especially for the reason, just to wipe out a race, they didn't do this to the Polish people like they did to the Jewish people. So, what I would have to say, that -- in the respect, they didn't lose what we lost. They still have a country, where we got to be people without homes, no place to go.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Come on, anyone that compares this to a Holocaust doesn't think straight, because Kosovo, those two factions, are people that have their land, and each one is fighting for possession and power.

We were citizens of each country that we lived in, and this is -- we tried to live peacefully, we had nothing against anyone. We were simply killed, and tried to be exterminated, because we were Jews, simply. The goal -- Hitler's goal was to exterminate the Jewish race. We were not fighting for property, or for a country. We did not have a country. Kosovo, and the Serbs, they have countries, right? They lived side by side each other, and each one wanted to dominate, and this is what started it. They fought one another, okay? And they -- Whatever happened there, it's their own fault. They brought it upon themself, I feel sorry for all the people, for the -- like I said, for the little children -- innocent children -- innocent people being killed. When I see that, I get very upset, because it does remind me of World War Two, and of the killings, but you can never compare it to the Holocaust, never.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What about the argument that some people have made that of course this isn't like the Holocaust, but if countries had acted when whole populations were being persecuted in the past, then a lot could have be-been avoided.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think that -- I-I'm all for helping, I'm all for helping, because I remember how helpless we were.

I just didn't believe in anything.</p><p>I couldn't figure out a merciful God looking down could let all of this happens.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm. I think in one of your video interviews, you mentioned that before you came here -- they have a little quote here, that you said that you had heard wonderful things about the United States.</p></p></dialogue>

And my father was always busy working, because in Poland we had to work many hours to make a living, you know? So he had no time to read the paper, and my mom used to sit next to him while he was working, and read the paper to him loud. And then when she read about something like that, she should -- used to shake her head, and said, "Only in the United States, things like that could happen.</p><p>This must be some wonderful place."

And then, when -- in the first few years you were here, do you think that the United States lived up to the advance billing, or not?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, I would say very much so, because you know, we lived on a little place, where everything was primitive. There wasn't running water, there were no flush toilets, there was nothing. And I came here, and saw all that you could have, you know, refrigerators, you know, and gas stoves. There was never anything like that when I was a little girl.</p><p>Running water in the house, a -- a -- a bathroom, and bathtub in the house, where we had a big tub, you know, all the time. So, I thought it was wonderful, oh. And even now, when I sit in my dreams, such foolish things, I try to imagine I'm talking to my mother, that she's sitting next to me, and I'm saying to her, "Look Mom, how wonderful. All you have to do is press a button, and your clothes gets washed. Can you see all these wonderful things that are here?"

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I would say, in the beginning maybe not, because the closeness with the families was always there, even in -- and the other people's lives here. People were much closer in families than they are now. Children and parents were together, things were done together, and I was always invited to people's homes, and to dinners, and stuff like that.</p><p>Everybody sat down at the table, the children were there, our children were there.

So it was like ri -- somehow, the family that we didn't have, it was compensating very much. The only hard time was when it came to our holidays.</p><p>So, it was very hard to take, because you sat at the table, and you thought of the wonderful times you had at home, surrounded by everybody, and by all the tradition.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: You know, off-hand, I can't think of it, but probably by the time you're gone, I would say I should have said this, or I should have said that, and that's what probably will happen. I just -- I don't know. I know one thing, when we get old, we survivors who think time is running too fast for us, we try to do so much more, to be -- that it should be left behind. You -- You know, my two daughters never got married, I don't have any grandchildren, it's hard to take this. They just elected to be career women. Yeah, I would like to have some grandchildren, somebody left to remember everything, but then I compensate myself at the mind that all of this is recorded, and some people will know about it anyway. So this -- I think this is a very good thing that is happening to me. And many schools also tape me, and they have that on their files. And I go, for the fourth time, I went to Milwaukee, to Marquette University. And they always tape it, they considered this a lecture. And every year, when I come, they make a tape of whatever I say, and they file in their files there, so that -- that's something that I think is very good.</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.
