<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Excuse me, do you want Tencer Chana, or do you want Chana Tencer? Because she is used to the [indecipherable] way, and she starts from the last name.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Life has changed, because as the Germans came in, they started rounding up people in the streets. Then we had to wear the armbands, and that was the big change in life.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The armbands were white with a blue Star of David on it. This was specifically for the Jews to wear, so that they would be recognized, by wearing that white armband with the blue Star of David.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How -- you were just a child then, how did you understand all that? What -- what -- what did -- do you remember what you thought when you had to go and wear a special thing on your arm?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I only thought in terms of why is it that we are different from the others.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you have an answer to that? Di -- what did that mean for you?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And then, I assume they -- you saw more Germans, did they --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Fear. I felt very fearful.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can you describe the situation?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My first memory of that is when the Germans used to come -- came up to our apartment with dogs, and I was sitting on the couch, and one of the big dogs jumped on me, and this is what I remember.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Why did they come to your apartment?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Wi -- nobody knows, but there were searches being conducted.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay, let's turn off. It's difficult --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- so she should treat me like [indecipherable]</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Okay, the change occurred when certain streets were completely cleared of the Jewish people. But we li -- I -- they lived in an apartment which was on the side streets, which was still open to Jews. And they lived in a three bedroom apartment, which immediately was being packed with other people who were being evacuated, cleared off the other streets.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And so other people moved into her apartment? <span class="page-break" number="1"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see, so [indecipherable]</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And that was not the end yet. The big change came about when the people who were placed in our apartment had to take up the room which my sister and I once shared, just the two of us, and now we had all these other people in our room, and on our bed, too.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How many people?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So -- how did they eat? I mean, how did -- did they have to provide for them? How did they get food, and --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Everybody was trying to organize his own way, his o -- his own food, and there were -- bread was being rationed, and you had to stand in line, and sometimes all night long to stand in line to get your bread. And these people, just like everybody else, had to sort of, say, shift for themselves, and stand on line, and of course sometimes the line got -- by the time they got to your point in the line, the food was gone. But this is -- basically was the division of everybody for himself. They had to secure their own food, and they -- her family had to secure her own food.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was the atmosphere like in the apartment?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Very stressful. But we shared whatever we could with each other, so that nobody in the house was -- went hungry.</p></p></dialogue>

And as -- and people did not go hungry at that time, while food was still available.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Up until what point was there enough food? <span class="page-break" number="2"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: It went on like this up to the time when the Jews were removed from the -- from town all together, but there was less and less bread, but it was all rationed. But there was always less of it, up to the point when the town was cleared of Jews.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you hungry, though, up until the for -- of the time that the town was cleared of Jews?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, basically the children, she and her sister very seldom went hungry because their parents would give up their own rations to feed the children.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did your father continue working at -- at his profession for this period?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: There was forced labor, and when they came and made you go to do forced labor, you did, and my father -- her father did that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What -- what sort of -- two questions, what sort of forced labor, and was it every day, or was it -- from the -- with the way she just said it I got the feeling maybe it was just occasional, or --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, this was work here and there, as they required and as they -- as they rounded up people. There were -- there were people -- there were people who were rounded up for this forced labor, who would come back beaten up, and some would never come back.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: There were many people dead in the street, who were just laying in the street, and that is what I saw for the first time in my life, though other people were dying also, but basically what you saw on the streets all the time were these corpses.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I saw them -- I saw single corpses here and there, but mother was very protective, and she would not allow me to see it, so whenever there was somebody killed in the street, she made sure that I didn't go out to see any more than I -- I have already seen. 1... Ido remember something. ... They were apparently concentrating all the people at that time, but basically there was a work -- there was work to be done in our town because of the munitions factory. And they were always looking toward having cheap, or slave labor out of the people who were shipped in.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I don't know if she happens just to know how many people were in the ghetto by 1944 when everyone was --</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I guess what I was interested to hear was that there was this sense of solidarity with the new arrivals, and trying to help, and that it was organized help. And I just wondered if she could tell me a little about the theater group, and -- and doing plays, and what plays she did, and -- and what she -- what she thought she was doing, and what was her understanding of that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, the theater was composed of th -- I need to answer. Then there was a -- there was a -- a little drama about a woman who took in a child, and she was -- she wasn't very kind to the child, and the child was taken away from her, and that was the drama that they enacted on the stage in that little theater.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So there were a few happy memories from this time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The most important thing is that I was at that time still with my parents and my sister.</p><p>And my parents were -- their only goal was to protect us, and to feed us, and to -- to be sure that our way of life does not change as drastically as the circumstances have forced us to live in.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You knew at that point what each group meant, that it -- you were presumably put in the children's group.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, she was a older child --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So th --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They're talking about --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, little -- little children.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Babies, yeah. What was the question originally?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, ho -- did she know what was -- everybody was aware that little children were going to be --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, yes. Then there was also a group of women that was being separated and my mother was in it, sort of assigned to personnel, that they were going to run personnel or whatever. And I stayed with my mother, and -- and I was able to get in with her, into that group.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And what ha -- where were you taken?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We were marched into -- toward that camp. Father always -- also went to Shterneetsa, the camp Shterneetsa.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But he marched separately, or --</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p> A All four. Father, mother, and the two girls. <span class="page-break" number="9"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You know, when you di -- I was coming back to what you were saying about the doctor and -- and her child. From the footage that I've seen, the -- the selections always look sort of -- everyone seems very quiet, and passive, but obviously that wasn't the case with -- with the selection as you experienced it. It must have been a lot of screaming, and crying, and horrible, awful stuff.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: If the people were very quiet, chances are that they were totally in shock. Because the crying, and the -- and the -- the -- the noises were basically were people were being separated, where they were being torn apart. But otherwise, people were in total shock, and they were -- i-in that way, they were quiet. There were also those who were [indecipherable] and they knew that this was the last -- last trip.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell me a -- so you -- you marched for three or four hours to the camp?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was two or three.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Two or three hours to the camp. What happened when you arrived?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: When we arrived at the camp Shtelneetsa, there was a wall-like structure, because ...</p><p>There was a communal kitchen where soup was being cooked, and people who went to work in the factory got a portion of soup and a piece of bread in the morning, and the same in the evening when they returned from the factory.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you work in the factory?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I was -- I did not work in the factory, I was peeling potatoes in the kitchen, work with my mother.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was there a roll call every day, was there strict discipline in the camp?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: There was no roll call as such, however people did have to line up by specific arrangement to go to work.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And how long was the working -- how long did you have to go to work?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: How many hours --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, the father, for example, how --</p></p></dialogue>

There were three -- <span class="page-break" number="10"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Shifts.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Shifts, thank you. Three shifts, eight hours each.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was the -- did many people die through the hard conditions and lack of food?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Very many people died, not just from the conditions and work, but also from typhus.</p><p>There was a typhus epidemic at that time in the camp. I reme -- she remembers that the commandant of the -- of the police -- of the -- the German police, during the epidemic came one day to camp, parked his car in a specific place, and told all the -- the sick ones to come out and run around the car. And whoever couldn't make it was shot right then and there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were there many incidents of simply gratuitous brutality like that? I mean --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I guess what I'm unclear about i-in the -- this whole thing with the camp is how is it different from a concentration camp? How is it different from Auschwitz?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The first thing is there was no crematorium. In this camp there was still families, you could still see the families. In Auschwitz it was already all separated and -- and no more family set up.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were the living conditions better than at Auschwitz, or about the same? Food, lodging, clothing, whatever.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And how long were you here for, at this camp? ... And just -- just one second, just sorry --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: May [also explain before we start, as I told you before, there were two camps, and this camp, Shtelneetsa was later liquidated and combined with the other Myoufka camp, you see?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So she went from one to the other.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: She went from one to the other as I did, too, and we went to Auschwitz as one unit.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: From the second camp.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right. Because first there were three camps, then there were two camps, and then there was one camp. And -- you see?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And -- and let me just double check one thing, which is, the men were ... <span class="page-break" number="11"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I don't think this came out very clear, that she didn't say it so that you -- I -- I -- let -- let me just coach her.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay, I understood that. How was her health, and her family's health in this time, did they get sick?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You know, her father died in camp?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I know, so --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We actually were -- had typhus first, and that weakened us all. But we somehow recovered even though we were weak, but the father was paralyzed after the typhus, and he died in Shtelneetsa camp.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did he have any medical help when he was sick? Did there -- was there a doctor?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The only medical help that I'm aware of is that one of the Ukrainian guards was paid to bring in leeches from town. And he brought the leeches, and my father was treated with leeches, and that's about all I know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were -- was your mother, or were any of you with your father when he died?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My mother was -- the mother was with the father.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And what -- what day did he die?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I don't know the date. ... transfer of other people that --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Try and get her to really tell it --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Fine.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- in detail with --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, I don't really know that she knows more than that, you see?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: About -- about the breakout?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: She remembers that the -- when the f -- ... the night before he died, she saw -- the last time I saw my father, he was choking, and there was no pillow for to support his back. So my mother told me to sit down and support my wi -- support his back with my back. And this is the last time that I remember him alive.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Let's move on now to -- to when you move on to the third and final camp. <span class="page-break" number="12"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Okay. There were originally three camps, tarta -- now she's -- ... In that third camp, that was on the rail line -- ... The trains -- ... to -- to line up, and enter, the men separately from women. There was -- there were many more men than -- ... this was work force.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>Men were lined up on one end, we were -- the women were lined up on the other end, and we're -- and everybody was told to line up single file and enter. Many people saw what was happening, and as they approached the tri -- the entrance to the train -- to the wagon, instead of entering, would go to the end of the line, trying to beat it, so to say. And very soon the Germans realized that this was going to go on, and this wasn't what they were expected, so they started beating everybody furiously, and that way the ca -- the trains were loaded. Hel -- she remembers that her mother took with her a -- a teapot with water, and she sat on the teapot right along. The women's wagon train -- the wagons were not -- were orderly, they were -- they were packed pe -- they were packed with women, but not as badly as the male wagons for the --</p><p> End of Tape #1 <span class="page-break" number="13"></span> Tape #2</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: When we arrived in the camp, in Auschwitz platform -- ... women's camps. And all these women were wearing stripe -- you know, the stripes. And we noticed they had no hair, and we thought -- I thought that the -- she though that this was total like a madhouse, some kind of a madhouse, because these women were trying to shout something, and say something, but obviously they were talking in a language that she didn't understand. She didn't know what they were saying, so the whole thing was like an -- like a -- like a -- like an in -- like insanity, because nobody knew what they were saying. Finally, they were taken to the so-called bath, you know, the sownar?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And w-were supposed to enter a receptacle with water with the shoes on. And the next thing were told to strip naked, and the hair was shaved. The hair was shaved everywhere on the body by men. And how -- the first impression that the men were there viewing these women bodies, and -- and th -- the fact that in such circumstances that was -- that was the first, strongest impression of that time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can she carry on with what -- her next impression?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: From the sownar we -- they were taken out to be tattooed. Her mother, and her sister and she lined up together for the tattoo, to have consecutive numbers. After that, clothes was given out to -- to -- they -- their clothes was taken away, personal clothes was taken away. They were given out other clothes that was handed to them, it was more like putting, because tall women got short dresses, and short women got long dresses, and nobody got what really fit, it was just being handed out. And later on, when the number was administered to the arm -- the tattoo was done in the following fashion. They used a - - sawed off a fountain pen, and they applied little dots to make the number, dot after dot.</p><p>And all I remember -- all she remembers is that when the tattoo was done she was told to lick her finger with her saliva and -- and rub it on the number. Why that was to be done she doesn't know, but she did it. And that's -- that's the way the number was made.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What's -- what's your number?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Her number is A14319.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Is there a significance to the -- why an A?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was a series, but this was the second time around. Those are numbers that other people already had, without the A, and this was the second series number. So it's hard to tell how many people had the same numbers, except for the letter A.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Now, was there an insignia with it -- with the number? On the -- on the uniform? <span class="page-break" number="14"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh. No, there was the exact thing as was -- as appeared on the arm.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And then what happened after you were -- you were given your clothes?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They went to Birkenau, camp A -- camp A, barracks 25.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was -- was this whole entry process very well organized? Was it efficiently done? I mean, your first impression was that you were in the lunatic asylum.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Unfortunately they were so well organized that everything, absolutely everything was functioning perfectly.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was it mostly men? You -- you -- men would shave you, but was it mostly men in charge in running it, or were there women --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: On the camp? On -- on -- in the -- on the platform, or in the camp?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In the entry process, the shower, the shave [indecipherable]</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: All men.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you arrived at Birkenau, block 25, what did it look like?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The barracks were long, and they were divided. They were mostly Jewish women from Slovakia.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Could she say that once more from the top? Give them the names of like who they were, instead of just saying they were. Say the supervisor, the secretary, the messenger, whatever.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The personnel consisted of the main overseer of the -- of the barracks, the s-secretary, the messenger, four supervisors, ea -- one for each section of the barracks. They were all prisoners as we were, and they were women -- Jewish women from Czechoslovakia.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, did they -- what was your relationship with them? Did they treat you well, they were fellow prisoners, did they abuse you --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They weren't -- they weren't very awful to us, but certainly they were not good.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Could you give an example?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: When the roll call came around, they -- they yelled terribly. Also, they used to yell a lot when they were checking -- there was a check of the -- how the bunks were kept. And if they didn't like something there was terrible yelling, but they did not beat us. <span class="page-break" number="15"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did you have any personal possessions with you by -- at this stage?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, at first they were on quarantine -- ...</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And -- and then where were you sent after that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: At -- at first -- ... The first asa -- ...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can we --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: When we had a roll call early in the morning, every morning, was still dark outside, and the -- ... she remem -- ...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: A lot of like little details, like didn't you ever feel in the morning that you just couldn't get up and go do that again? You couldn't stand outside in that cold? Weren't you cold?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>Di -- could you ever wash? Could --</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The -- the business of washing up, of staying clean was that once every na -- every -- once in a while, the group would be taken to the sownar, which you know what it is, right, for disinfect -- ... Yes, people who were on that same bunk, would talk to each other, and most of the time about the past, but quite often about future, which was really fantasyland.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you in the same -- you were in the same barracks with your mother and sister?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: On the same bunk, in the same barracks, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That must have been the -- the reason you could survive.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think that I -- mother did not survive, sister did not survive, but I -- she thinks that she survive because that was meant to be. Destiny.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What sort of physical condition were the three of you in by the time the selection was made, the selection that you're going to tell us about?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Physically they were not well off because they were starving. Somehow or other they were pushed through, but that does not mean they were in good physical condition. <span class="page-break" number="16"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Were you or your mother or your sister ever punished for any reason?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The discipline was so -- so strong, and it was -- everything was obeyed that there was very seldom a reason to -- to punish any transgression. The biggest punishment as far as she's concerned is that she was taken to the gas chamber, and that's what she would like to tell.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Could she -- could -- would she tell us the story now, from beginning to end?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- till we get to the end.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Okay, okay, okay. [tells story in Polish]. This is very good point to break.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay, okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And wait [indecipherable]. Okay. ... piles of hell piled up, and she and her mother are huddling, and her mother is explaining to her that, "You shouldn't feel bad, because life - - all of life is just like a corridor, like a hallway, you know. You pass through it to a better life, and that's where we're going." Some women were hysterical, other women were sitting quietly, and every now and then the door would open, and the SS men -- women -- SS women would come in and say, "Ha, you're still alive." And they would close the door. And then they would hear all these sounds outside, laughing and joking. Then the <span class="page-break" number="17"></span> door opened again, and the men came in with gas masks on, and they had a box. They opened the box, which contained powder, like talcum powder, white talcum powder, and they scattered it around, and they threw the box down, and they left. Well, they were quite sure that this was the very end. And finally, a few more times, they -- the -- the -- then the women came in, the SS women said, "Now, you are going to have to sort these rags here, because these rags are going to be sent to the crematorium, and you are going to be sent to a place where there's braiding to be done." And so they said to each other, "That cannot be, they are teasing us, because what she means is that we will go the crematorium, and the rags are going to go to the place for braiding." And th-this lasted for 48 hours, no water, and no food. 120 -- 100 to 120 women. And these SS women constantly coming, "Oh, so you're still alive?" And all this brutal teasing type of thing.</p><p>Finally, one of the women -- then a women came who -- ... She has no recollection now, from this point on, that's why I cut it. They stayed about three days, she and her mother in that hospital, covered with -- ... She has never seen a selection as such in camp -- I mean that she -- if she wasn't in it, that she saw a selection. So she is take -- she was taken to that place, to another work camp, where they would braid -- ...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That they wanted to really gas you, and it didn't work? Ho-how do you understand this experience?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: What happened is that they were po -- most probably destined to be crem -- cremated, t- to do -- go to the crematorium, but the eastern front, the Russians, they were approaching.</p><p>This is now the end of the year, "44, you see?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Very near liberation. And so that they were demolishing the crematories, and the gas chamber, as you know, was the preliminary to the crematory.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right, right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And as they were demolishing the crematories, this gas chamber -- they probably wanted to take them there, and to -- to gas them, but they ran out of crematories, and that -- they had to open the door and let them out. And her destiny proved to be fate was kinder to them than to thousands of people who just went through that kind of hel-hell to get t-to -- to death.</p></p></dialogue>
