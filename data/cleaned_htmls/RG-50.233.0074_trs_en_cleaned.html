<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, they didn't take. But it was my first encounter with the Nazis passing me and soon afterwards the people were standing outside our store and they wrote down in big yellow letters "Jude" and they wouldn't let anybody come in our store. They blockaded it. And a few months later, the SS men came in our store and we had to walk out he said and we were not allowed to take the cash or anything from our store.

Only Jewish people went to escape elsewhere. And everybody tried another way. And my brother gave me advice and told me, why don't you look in the phone book and write to some people and they will sponsor us because no country would let you in anymore. We could leave Vienna if anybody would let you in but no country wanted to leave the refugees in. So we took a English phone book and I wrote five names from the alphabet. The first five names. I wrote to Abbot was his name Abbot and four more names and my sister wrote to a few B's and her name was Bell. And a few weeks later, I got an answer from a man named Abbot and my sister from the name Benn and he said he would sponsor us and be able to help a human life.</p><p>And he wrote all the documents and this is the way I came to England. And he was a complete stranger. It was in 1939. And when I came to England, he was a furrier and right in the heart of Oldgate he was situated. And I went to thank him and we were not allowed to take any money, of course, only 30 shillings we were allowed to take from Vienna and we were not supposed to in England because he guaranteed for us but he asked me and asked. of course, because no money or nothing, and asked, can you keep a needle in your hand. And are you good at sewing and I say of course. So he gave me a job off the books. He paid me in cash and I was sewing and I was happy and I had a job there in his factory. I was sewing lining in fur coats and he was very nice. He save my life. And my sister.</p><p>She was married at that time.</p></p></dialogue>

He stayed in Vienna two years after Hitler occupied Vienna and in the meantime his quota was ready to go to America and on the last boat what came from Austria to America he was on it and he came to America.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember the street that you lived in, what section?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Haborstrasser?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Haborstrasser. It was in the second. , the Leiperstadt, the most Jewish people lived there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: This was a Jewish neighborhood?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Jewish neighborhood. Haborstrasser, that's where my mother used to live and we used to live when we were children. And when the Nazis came and they knocked at our door and it was an apartment building and they wanted to take my brother and my father. And we didn't open the door and a neighbor from the same floor, she came out, she was not Jewish. And she said "what do you want from those people, they're not at home. And they are very nice Jewish people, what do you want from them. Leave them alone". A neighbor said that. And they walked away. But it was first week when the Nazis occupied. But they, of course, didn't leave the Jewish people alone.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you know anybody personally that was taken away by the Nazis?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yes. My cousins. They took my cousins away. They took them first to Dachau. But, they let them go. In the beginning they let some of them go, but later on it was worse. They wouldn't let any Jewish people survive. It was terrible. But the worst part was you had no rights anymore. You couldn't go anywhere to complain. You couldn't go to the police or to anywhere. They took all your rights away and there was not place you could go to fight for your rights. This is the worst thing of all.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When you went to England, what kind of passport did you have?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I had a German passport and it was written as Margaret Sarah. All the Jewish women they called Sarah.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Israel.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you had a German passport. You were no longer Austrian but German. Did you have a "J"</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="4"></span>  on your passport?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yes. The "Jude" was the main thing. It was the worst crime you could have had, to be a Jude, a Jew.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What did your mother and father think of the Nazis?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, terrible. You know, when they came for us and they had been singing in the street, "Juden brut offen messer", terrible always against the Jews singing those words and my mother and my father were shaking, you know, they couldn't believe it, suddenly we were such enemies without any reason. It was terrible the propaganda. Hitler, the speeches, I thought screaming like a mad man.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember your parents talking about the Nazis before they came in, when they were in power in Germany in 1933?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yes. They said it's terrible. But as terrible as it was, they didn't realize that that mad man would take the Jews and kill them like that. Nobody realized what really could happen because that never happened before in our time, if you remember. So nobody knew he was sending them to the gas chambers when we were living there. He kept it a secret too. I don't know if you ever saw in the movies, when he takes all those Jewish people and puts them in those trains and the women, they were so vain, they wanted to look nice, they took the suitcase and everything, they didn't know where they were going. You saw the movies. And as soon as they went, as soon as the trains arrived in the concentration camps, they took their luggage away and they were sorted out who was going to live a little longer and who was going to the gas chambers. As soon as the train arrived. You saw the movies, those things. Terrible.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now your parents, in Vienna. Your father continued to run the store after the Anschluss?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, no. they took away our store.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I remember, you explained that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, no, it was the end.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How long after did that happen?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We were still there, maybe two or three months after the anschluss, we could keep it and then they took it away, until they got organized the Nazis, they found all the Jewish stores. And I had an uncle, my father's brother, he was very wealthy in Vienna. He had a big warehouse, like Macy's. These people, they went first to those people because they had most money. He was very, very organized. First, he went to all the rich people and they took everything away. And then he went to the people who were not that rich. But everybody got it in the end. You couldn't keep anything.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When you were planning to leave, you were writing to people in phone book addresses, were your parents thinking about leaving Vienna as well?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, my mother, she always said he would leave, he would realize it. She always was optimistic</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="5"></span>  and she said, he would leave the old people, what can old people do for him, he would leave the old people alone.

She thought he would leave the old people alone.</p><p>But there was no chance she could leave. Nowhere to go.

I had a cousin she went on a boat to Israel and the English people, they were just fighting with Israel. They sunk her boat and she was killed by the British. Her mother was on the boat and her husband and the baby. And they all got killed. The boat was bombed by the British. It was near Israel and it was sunk by the British. Did you know that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I didn't know about this boat.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because I had two cousins, her brothers, my cousins two brothers. I met them before we went to America, we went back to Vienna to see if I could find out anything from my parents.

And after the war he went back to Vienna.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, the blind man, first of all. But then, I wasn't sure because he didn't know where they</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="8"></span>  were sent. He only was in Theresienstadt with them. And the reason that Hitler left him alone was he would have been a headache for them. He was blind and they ordered to go there and go there to the chambers, you know.</p></p></dialogue>

And then, just after 50 years, I saw an ad in the local paper and there was a phone number from the Red Cross and they say they could find some Holocaust victims and you could call a number. When I called the number from the Red Cross and they sent me a form because I was always wondering what really happened. It never left my mind. I sent out the application and a few months later they say they have an answer, they found my parents. I was so surprised. I thought "how could they find two names from so many million people." I guess when they really found out when and where they died and what happened.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I remember she always used to tell us the people in Austria, they were anti-Semitic, even the kings and the queens, they were all against Jews. The only one that was good to the Jews was the last one, Cata Fransion, I don't know if you ever heard of him.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And my mother always said that it was right for Maria Theresa because she hated Jews so much. And in her time the Jewish people had to go to a certain district in Vienna and all of the Jewish people lived in a certain district in Vienna, the Leiberstein. That's where I was brought up too.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Where your parents lived?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. But after Kaiser Josef came in Austria, he was very good to the Jews. He made no extinguishing against Jews and non-Jews, they had all the jobs they could have and they all loved him. Kiser Franz Josef of Hapsburg. And she always said if he would have still been in the government, Hitler would never have come to Austria.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think as you must know that in Poland was also always anti-Semitic. My father's parents, they left Poland because of the anti-Semitic. That's why they settled down in Vienna. His parents settled down in Vienna too.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="11"></span> </p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, no. When Hitler came, it was open up. It was a big difference. But the Jews had all the rights that the other people had. You could go to the police, you could go anywhere. But as soon as Hitler came, all this disappeared. But to most of the people, I think it was welcome.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you know any refugees from Germany who came to Austria?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. But I remember when Hitler came to Germany, a lot of German Jews, he let them go and they even could take their money with them. They went to Israel, a lot of them and a lot of them went to South America. At first he wasn't that bad. He let them go with their money. But a few years later, he got worse and worse. He got crazier and crazier. He took everything away from them, including their lives.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did your parents ever discuss the possibility that the Germans might invade Austria and take it over?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yes, But he was sick, sick like nobody else. And he had an easy field because Germany was so bad there and people couldn't find any work so he blamed everything on the Jews.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How was the economy in Vienna?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not very good. The people were not rich in Vienna, the Jewish people. Very few of them. We all could make a living but nothing like in America, it was much easier.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It wasn't really a depression. But what I remember it, the money overnight, when I was a child, it was worthless. One day you could buy a house and the next day for the same money you could buy a loaf of bread. If you didn't have a house or property, you better beg of it one day.</p><p>Overnight it happened.

So when the Nazis came she lost it all. Whatever you had, you lost. And my uncle and aunt in Eisenstadt, they had vineyards. Took all the vineyards and the house. The money, you lost. The more you had, you lost everything, the more you lost. All your rights, your property and your money, everything. You're lucky you didn't lose your life.
