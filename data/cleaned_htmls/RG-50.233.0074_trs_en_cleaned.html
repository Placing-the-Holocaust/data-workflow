<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yes, without buying anything.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did they take? Did they take anything?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, they didn't take. But it was my first encounter with the Nazis passing me and soon afterwards the people were standing outside our store and they wrote down in big yellow letters "Jude" and they wouldn't let anybody come in our store. They blockaded it. And a few months later, the SS men came in our store and we had to walk out he said and we were not allowed to take the cash or anything from our store. My sister and I were there and we had to just walk out and leave everything behind. We had no more rights because we were Jews.</p></p></dialogue>

We couldn't take a out or anything,, the cash register, nothing. We just had to walk out. It was one of our first experiences. We didn't know how bad it was going to be but everybody tried to escape. Only Jewish people went to escape elsewhere. And everybody tried another way. And my brother gave me advice and told me, why don't you look in the phone book and write to some people and they will sponsor us because no country would let you in anymore. We could leave Vienna if anybody would let you in but no country wanted to leave the refugees in. So we took a English phone book and I wrote five names from the alphabet. The first five names. I wrote to Abbot was his name Abbot and four more names and my sister wrote to a few B's and her name was Bell. And a few weeks later, I got an answer from a man named Abbot and my sister from the name Benn and he said he would sponsor us and be able to help a human life.</p><p>And he wrote all the documents and this is the way I came to England. And he was a complete stranger. It was in 1939. And when I came to England, he was a furrier and right in the heart of Oldgate he was situated. And I went to thank him and we were not allowed to take any money, of course, only 30 shillings we were allowed to take from Vienna and we were not supposed to in England because he guaranteed for us but he asked me and <span class="page-break" number="0"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection not Jewish.</p></p></dialogue>

The "Jude" was the main thing. It was the worst crime you could have had, to be a Jude, a Jew.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What did your mother and father think of the Nazis?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, terrible. You know, when they came for us and they had been singing in the street, "Juden brut offen messer", terrible always against the Jews singing those words and my mother and my father were shaking, you know, they couldn't believe it, suddenly we were such enemies without any reason. It was terrible the propaganda. Hitler, the speeches, I thought screaming like a mad man.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember your parents talking about the Nazis before they came in, when they were in power in Germany in 1933?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yes. They said it's terrible. But as terrible as it was, they didn't realize that that mad man would take the Jews and kill them like that. Nobody realized what really could happen because that never happened before in our time, if you remember. So nobody knew he was sending them to the gas chambers when we were living there. He kept it a secret too. I don't know if you ever saw in the movies, when he takes all those Jewish people and puts them in those trains and the women, they were so vain, they wanted to look nice, they took the suitcase and everything, they didn't know where they were going. You saw the movies. And as soon as they went, as soon as the trains arrived in the concentration camps, they took their luggage away and they were sorted out who was going to live a little longer and who was going to the gas chambers. As soon as the train arrived. You saw the movies, those things. Terrible.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How long after did that happen?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We were still there, maybe two or three months after the anschluss, we could keep it and then they took it away, until they got organized the Nazis, they found all the Jewish stores. And I had an uncle, my father's brother, he was very wealthy in Vienna. He had a big warehouse, like Macy's. These people, they went first to those people because they had most money. He was very, very organized. First, he went to all the rich people and they took everything away. And then he went to the people who were not that rich. But everybody got it in the end. You couldn't keep anything.</p></p></dialogue>
