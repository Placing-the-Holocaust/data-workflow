<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What I was asking was, before that, what do you attribute the fact that he went to these people and offered them the basement?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Kindness. He wanted, he must have known that the Jewish people got killed somehow.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you consider that a brave act on his part, that he sheltered?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: That was, but that was brave. That was brave but the way he confessed it and said shoot me.</p><p>He should have kept his stupid mouth shut. Then he would still be living. I don't know whether they would still be living. He's older but --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You think the Nazi soldiers would have left him alone if he hadn't said anything, even though they knew the Jews were in his basement?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: They weren't ready to, he wasn't ready to kill him because he dropped his gun by my mom.</p><p>So he probably --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: He probably wouldn't have done anything at that point? <span class="page-break" number="56"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Edith Langer 58</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Wouldn't have done anything, but him on a truck and get into farm labor or something you know.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's how you went to the farm, in a nightgown.</p></p></dialogue>
