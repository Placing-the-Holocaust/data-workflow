<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. Did your parents have contact with any family members who still were over?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right. In fact, I'm going to give you an article to read. The New York Times obituary of Monday, August 16th, 1943, has an obituary for my grandfather, and here's the headline: Abraham Pinkofsky dies at age of 104. One of 13 grandsons in war cited; three other lose lives. And it tells about, there were nine ---- I think nine grandsons of his were in the American military service.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, my. Oh, my.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Of which, all of us came back.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Wonderful.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: None of us, I think, were wounded. Three of them ----- the paper only mentions the grandsons who were officers. One was Captain David Weiss (ph). At that time, my grandfather's death, he was a chief surgeon at Fort Totten, Queens. In fact, he told me that was the best year of his life, when he was there, because he had a beautiful home, right, at a beautiful area. It's a peninsula on there ---- where the East River joins the Long Island Sound. Another son had been an infantry captain, another grandson. And they took him out of the infantry, and he never went overseas. He was assigned to, I think, Camp Detrick, in Frederick, Maryland.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Fort Detrick. Fort Detrick.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah. It became Fort Detrick</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And the reason they took him out of the infantry was, he had a doctorate in bacteriology.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, right. Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And he did research on biological warfare. In fact, I think he came down with anthrax himself.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, my gosh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But he survived. They were working with the bug.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Um--hum. Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="17"></span> ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And another one, doesn't say where he was.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Where ---- let's go back to your story now. So, you took the Queen Elizabeth over.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right. With 20,000 other men.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Twenty thousand.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You couldn't imagine how crowded it was.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. And where did you land?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We landed in ---- I think it's called Gourock, the Port of Glasgow.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Is that correct?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I don't know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I don't know names. And we were welcomed ----</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Um--hum.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: ---- as we landed in the morning by a parade of a band of men in kilts playing bagpipes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was our greeting to Great Britain.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And as we paraded off, we march to the train and that took us to England.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And it was a full day trip down to a place ---- I don't know what ---- where they stopped, but I know wherever we stopped, I had gotten sick on the train. I got land sick.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Um--hum.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And the fellows helped me off onto a truck, and we went to a camp at a place called Wotton--under--Edge.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't think you've ever heard of it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But a very famous man came from there. Wyecliffe. You ever hear of Wyecliffe?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Wyecliffe translated the Bible to English.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="18"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right. Into English, right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You're talking about April "44, right?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: April "44.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think it took us about eight days to get there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Now, the Queen Elizabeth normally would make England in about four days and five hours, but it took a wandering course.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes. I would imagine.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Every trip was different.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Um--hum.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And the ship changed course every six minutes. But the last night, as we were approaching the coast of England, up at Scotland, it was changing course every minute or two.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, my. Oh, my.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And people were falling out of the bunks. It was just keeling. Unbelievable. But they got us there safely.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes, right. Right. So, then you were in Wyecliffe. And then what?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We were there maybe about a week, and we went to another town, at ---- called Clevedon, on the coast.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And then we went to ---- from there, we're there maybe two or three weeks, we went to a place called Pittsfield, about 20 miles north of Bristol.</p></p></dialogue>
