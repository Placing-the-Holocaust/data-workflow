<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Where were you born?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In Grabow, the province of Poznan, Poland. But Poland under occupation of German in 1908, we still lived under the German power.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Father, if you would lean back and relax. I will move my chair forward if necessary so that you can hear me, but</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We have started?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: We have started. It's important that you be comfortable.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Uh...Tell me about your family. How many people were in your family and what...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We were 9 children, five brothers and....uh...six brothers and three sisters. And...uh...we all had been educated first of all in the German schools and then since 1918, we had the opportunity to be taught in the Polish schools. And in my case I had to go to the college also and did then I studied theology in Rome, being called according to my judgment and conviction to the priesthood I had to study theology, philosophy and theology. And I entered the Society of the Catholic Apostolite, and after the first preparation, that is to say, grammar school, college...uh...after I have finished also philosophy in Poland, I was sent to Rome.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Could we...could we back up a little bit? I'd like to know a little more before we go into those years.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: About your childhood. When you were...uh...a young boy...uh...I'd like to know a little bit about what life was like for you and your parents as a young...as a young...when you were a young boy in Poland.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You see, when I was 6 years old, then I started the grammar school. Yet in...in 1918, we..we are very unhappy because of the war. And my father was convoked to the army as the officer because he was ordered the school, and did then in the first year of...uh... the battle <span class="page-break" number="0"></span> between German...German and Russian soldiers, he was taken into Russian captivity already in 1915 and he was there, which he knew Russian of course, so his conditions of life were not so difficult there. And the...the Russians have esteemed him and used him rather for the more secretarial work, not handwork. In 1918, he benefited and profited by the...uh...</p><p>disorder because of the Russian Revolution and the __. You see, just by his judgment he knew what to do and came to our family in 1918 and...uh...when Poland became independent, he also had to enter the Polish army. But after some months he came back home and continued his business work. He was an exporter of food to greater cities, also to Berlin, during the occupation of Poland by Germans. And so our conditions of life were rather good and we had the opportunity to be developed really in the atmosphere of a loving family. And when other members, my brothers and sisters heard about the my life's decision that I will go to priesthood, then they also sympathized with me and helped me really to reach that priesthood by their sympathy, by their prayers and so on. And so...and....uh...uh...in 1920, I went to the gymnasium of Naklo in Poland and...uh...there I was 2 years and then transferred to Wadowice to the high school of my society. And...uh...it was in the dioceses of Krakau. And...uh...then after I had finished the high school, I entered the preparatory school for priesthood and...uh...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What made you decide to go on and to enter the preparatory school? Why did you become a priest? Want to become a priest?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You see there was in me some conviction that this is my way of life. It was not my decision, strictly speaking or theologically speaking, but some preparation from above. You see, we do believe in...uh...in our faith that all the vocations of priesthood for religious life come from God himself. And no doubt in order that this cause may mature, you may live a very dignified and religious also family. My parents were very faithful members of the church.</p><p>All my brothers and sisters too. It was really the proper atmosphere. Also helping to deepen my conviction, there is my place. And did then after I finished philosophy, I was sent to Rome to the University to studv theoloov and._uh .to get a doctor decree in <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> Pastoral care of all Poles in Poland. And we had there are about 50 priests who worked for the Polish people only, and as a young Priest I became a Superior of them. Traveling from place after place during summer. It was some days in which I remember some Polish parish has celebrated some feast and so I visited also in this way the territory of France. And then ..then when the war came, ___ to France, 1939, we have really also suffered much. And then...then suffered much because...especially because Germans...Germany has occupied Paris. And._.uh. here really is mv creat. I would sav. for for martvrdom <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> approach to Hitlerism I was not allowed to live as a free person. So they considered me as an Enemy No. 1. And then from Paris after 1 month of being in prison, I was just transferred...transferred to Berlin, and on my way to in Berlin, I was few days in Trier, ___, Hanover, and came to Berlin on December the 10, 1940...1940 to Berlin,</p><p> __. And really that in Berlin was a place of torture. And...uh...you see no freedom. Just closed in the cell and...uh...I was really free only 2 times a month to take some part in the of all the prisoners. Twice a month I was able to leave the cell. Otherwise, cell was my unique, only place to live. But in...uh...the week which we called Holy Week, I was really taken into the black cell, that is to say without a light, without a light, without water, without anything, and there was a left there for 6 days. That is to say, imagine only you have no possibility to look through the window because everything was closed. You didn't have any possibility to take water or some...take some food because they didn't bring it to you. After this Holy Week, I was really exhausted. But this was not sufficient for them.</p><p>You see, they...I suppose they tried just to kill me, and they came at the end and felt...treated me so cruelly that I was fully exhausted and perhaps it seemed to them that I am not living any more, but to be sure they took me to the hospital where conditions were certainly not easy but better than the prison. So after some days I have recuperated and then they have taken me back to the . But with more normal conditions of life. That is to say, I have received the regular food as other prisoners, but only with the privilege to leave for the Priminate twice a month. And from ____ I was from December 10, 40. On July 29, 41, I left Berlin and then transferred to the camn of Sachsenhausen close to <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> Dachau for him was an organized Hell. And you see if somebody very intelligent person really writes so that not only for him, but for all the people, it was really life in Hell, without any hope, without peace, without liberty. You have been considered just there as a mechanical instrument, moved here and there. And...uh...in my case as the Polish priest, also, we had to work everyday in this so called plantation. And the...the work was really not easy and then every day, every day the same work. And without enough food. And then with the spirit of persecution you see. All those Gestapo people who really tried to direct our work, we our not human and..uh.. although...although they were very...uh...I would say...</p><p>uh...against all of us. Yet we tried to avoid their discipline you see. And we did when they have...when they have...uh...come to us, we tried to do our best. When they disappeared, we just relaxed. And so they didn't have the true judgment of our work, but when they have seen that we really were not working what they have beaten us. And you see, some Gestapo people were very cruel without any sense of justice and the mocked kindness. And many people beaten, and the plantation had to be transferred to the so-called hospital in Dachau.</p><p>And there the Gestapo men finished them. You see, there was a hospital in Dachau. I was there also for...uh...some days just to heal my wounds here on the legs. And...uh...we didn't have the true conditions which a sick person should have in the hospital. You see, they treated us just as some living instrument and moved us here and there, also without the proper food. But in those conditions, it was really very important to have a firm will and peace of heart. How was it possible to find peace of heart in such conditions? And I answered just by your faith. You see, if you believed in God, in his not only justice, but also Law, then you knew that you are under his protection and if he permits all that suffering to us, it is also on the basis that we, the mortal priest, are co-responsible for the salvation of the other people. And you cannot be safe according to our gospel, but taking also part in some suffering. St. Paul in his Epistles tells us that our Lord has suffered for us and they offered to God that suffering, but in order that the suffering may be a stripe to us, we had to complete also that suffering by giving our part. And so if you have such faith that your suffering really can bring some fruit to you, to your brethren, then you have found also energy and strength to survive. And...uh...we say very often that suffering can break or make you. It can break you if you see nonsense in the suffering, but if you find out that there is some value also of suffering and because of this in the popular language, we say that it can make you...it can make you stronger. The more so stronger if you are a believer. If you think that everything is under the divine control. And in this faith and in this spirit you can really energize also your body and bring more peace for your daily life.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did that help you in Dachau? What was in...in Dachau, how did your faith help you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>What...what kind of things did you do in Dachau?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You see, it was really...very great danger to lose faith in Dachau. If your faith was not firm.</p><p>Why? Because the German Bishop have received from Himmler the privilege that he has also given to the German priest a chapel, and they had the possibility to have their prayers, devotions, masses, and so on, but under one condition: no one accept German priests were allowed to take part all of the devotions performed in the chapel. But here the danger for some people...you see some people really intended, not only priests but lay people, intended <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> to go to the chapel and pray a little. But there was a custodian, the priest, who according to the order of Gestapo was not allowed to...any body to enter a chapel. And so the lay people said, "Well, how can I believe if this minister of God is so cruel just not to allow me to go to the chapel for a spiritual comfort? and obeys rather a Gestapo order and not God's way. We have to answer. "There are also people amone the nriest who act not according to their <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> us. And one thing, we priests, Polish priests, noticed that packages sent by our Mothers came intact without corruption. And then from other members of families, here and there there was food and damage by this or other conditions. And so one idea came to a priest and he composed a beautiful song in honor of our mothers and we sang, you see, this song, really giving not only our thanks but expressing our deepest affection to our mothers to our family also, but especially to our mothers. And so we, on this occasion, started also our psychology, and came to conclusion that really love for a mother is the deepest mother besides the love for a God. And then also this renewal I would say of that...uh...uh...love for our mother, with the food, really made us more normal people. And...uh.. when I was also in Dachau in...uh...in the hospital for some days, one priest was dying and called, "Mother," in such despair. "My dearest Mother." I approached him and told him, "Father, be consoled. You will find the blessed mother in Heaven." And he said, "Father, do you understand the deep love of a dying person fora mother?" And I said, "Well, I was not in this state of dying yet, but I understand that Mother really counts as the great consolation in the last moment of life." You see, we perhaps have not realized enough what great really strength is our love for a mother, and the love of Mother for us. Mother lives for her children. Not always children live for their mothers. But our suffering, for example, in this case in Dachau really renewed in us the worthiness. There is no greater love after our love for God, than the love for our mother which is not always developed, but different occasions can really develop to such an extent that it will become strength and renewed energy for us. So then came the blessed day of...uh...April 29.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can we hold it a minute. I would like not to get to the liberation yet. I would like to go back for a moment.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You have mentioned being in the hospital several times. Could you tell us about the events that led up to your being in the hospital and you told me an extraordinary story before. Tell us about that.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You see, when we speak of the hospital in Dachau or in Sachsenhausen then we should not believe that the name of hospital was identical with the conditions of a civilized hospital.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>You were there only an instrument...uh...which really received here...here and there some care, but most minimal. When you came to hospital, then all the people who took care of the sick people believed you came here to die. And so if you didn't have the interior strength and the...the hope to survive, the little food which you have received was not able to help you to survive that. And so many people really died there and how many? Well, for example, in Dachau 868 Polish priests perished. Eight hundred sixty eight, and 3 of them...200 of them in the medical experiments, by torture in the prison __. And the Polish clergy Dachau order no.</p><p>clergy of ordination, we were 1,718 numbers....1,718. And as I already told you, 868 were...died, and was martyred, of course. And...uh...then we must say that the...uh...priests slowly...at the end of 1944 received really some better conditions of life to such an extent that they have received also a permission that a French Bishop who was there also in Dachau <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> has ordained a gentleman deacon to the priesthood. You see, unheard...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you see the ordination?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, I...we did. Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Please. Put...put that down.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And it was Karla Lisner, Deacon Karl Lisner. He was ordained by the French Bishop.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell us about that ordination as you saw it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well. for us it was ereat dav not onlv because we witnessed the ordination of that Karl <span class="page-break" number="5"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You had said also you were in the hospital another time for your legs.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. That's right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Could you tell us about that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Uh...This was just only some hour in which I was there. There had seen what happened and given me some...uh...] would say means to stop the blood and so on and to cover all the wounds. I was there really for some hours to get some help, some assistance, but you see if you...if you did then have some inner strength and I would say...uh...desire to survive and to overcome all sufferings...also the very little sickness would you suffer, brought you to crematorium. You see when you speak of Dachau, then you just cannot think of normal conditions of human life. The more so of the proper conditions in the hospitals. They had to reopen also hospitals you see because well the human eye needed it and international opinion also. So many, so many, I would say, people knew about all these things and conditions in the concentration camps, then they just try also to visit or show here we also hospital we care of the sick people, but the visitors didn't have any possibility to talk with us, to speak to us, to ask how do you feel. And on the day if some visit was...uh...really programmed in the hospital, then they have prepared better food, for the eyes you see. But really inhuman conditions.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell us about that. Were you...uh...ever beaten and tortured in Dachau?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: You see, not tortured but perhaps not taken care of. This was the case. And so, for example, if...if 1 was weak because of exhaustion, then they have not tortured me there in Dachau.</p><p>Perhaps because I was priest. But they didn't assist me. You had to just take care of yourself.</p><p>And other people if they really were sick, they became victims of torture. Many, many people really just disappeared because the Gestapo inflicted such great and did suffering to them that they had to finish their life. So conditions which were not human you see, and because of this vou can understand whv the manv also writers. as I have quoted _ the <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> 0 TAPE #2</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Let us go back. If you would put that down. I would like to ask you now that the tape is on.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The questions I asked I asked you when the tape was off.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. Yal.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh...Could you tell me first, please, how you went about...uh...saying confession in Dachau.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes. You're on.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: We heard confession just by walking with some person who asked us for this privilege or we were hidden in some corner of the concentration camp because to hear confessions...you see it was really for the Gestapo some cause of a torture, and we tried to help the people that reallv in such wav that these are became the victims of torture. And. also. durine the <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> 1 they would like to finish Christianity. But they didn't have the possibility of it. You see there was a diabolical svstem . <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> 2</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You see then in April we all remained in 45...we already heard of the victory of anti- German...uh...German soldiers, in the battlefields, and it was for us also a great help and assistance for strengthening our bodies, our minds, and our lives. But slowly in April...in April, we noticed that German soldiers really are collapsing on the front, receiving here or there some information and then we have also heard that the American soldiers are annroaching and so also Dachau. And..uh.. some movement...uh._of the Gestano neonle <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> 3 Friday was the end of our real remarkable which for men became only torture one after the other, and many really ...uh...died and didn't survive to experience the date of liberation.</p><p>Such is the case.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Indeed. If you're are in Paris and your story is not over.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not over.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You're in Paris and you, I gather, was not in quite Paris either. The Communists didn't like you you told me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. You see...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I continued my work for two years. But being free and...uh..in agreement with the French government, I tried to purify the Polish parishes in France from any Communistic influence.</p><p>And...uh...to such an extent slowly...uh...uh...the General Council of Polish Communistic Government, you see, went to...uh...uh...the First Minister of French Government...uh...saying that I am just intolerable, that I persecute the peaceful people. And so some person was sent to me just to find out what is the matter. And I told him, "Well, you see, such is the case that we were not only against the Nazis, but also against Communist.</p><p>And for us Communists was also intolerable. And there are so many, so many communistic delegates from Russia to Polish groups that I had to defend our Polish citizens against this infiltration of communistic sick... sickness." And then I really never allowed to infiltrate in our Polish organization...we never allowed the communists to really bring to them some damage. And I have received the answer of the communist...the French government congratulations. Yes. The former anti-really to hide the people that they may not become victims of communists, but now you see the...no photographs here. The communists...the communists after they have not received any help from ...from French government and to pacify me, they went to the upper story to delegate. And what did they do? They told him, "Your Excellency. Certainly Christianity can develop only in peaceful conditions of co- livine and that this present and vou must correct him or even dismiss him."? And so <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> 4 me in my conversation, in my repression, and so on." And I told the delegate, "If the communistic consul general comes to our church...uh...to the Polish church, I will accept him really as the faith will. I will also hear his confession. And so be sure that in the matter of religion, those communists will not be persecuted. If they would like to become really faithful to the church, they will have all the opportunities barred to bring the communistic poison to our Polish ranks will be excluded, but you see when the communistic ambassador didn't succeed to pacify me, going to the French government, and then...uh...to the upper story...to delegate, they went to the Provincial Superior of my Province in Warsaw. And they said, "If you do not dismiss Father Cegielka from the office of the Superior of Polish Catholic Mission, we will close your houses. And the Provincial answered, "He is not subject to me in his office. He was nominated by the Cardinal , the Prime of the Poland. And so I have no power. I cannot do anything." And so the communists have understood that he cannot do anything and cannot just send me away from my office. So they went to the General and said, "If you do not dismiss this man from the office in Paris, that will be end of...uh...many priests in Poland." And so the General...the General</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The General of your order?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. The General wrote to me saying, "Father, you see I have received such bad news that they will close many things which are dear to us. Our schools, institution, and so on. And perhaps it would be advisable that you will ask the Primate to...uh...free you from that office." And so because it was the interest of the society which I belonged, I asked Primate just to free me from this office and he...he received...has written me letter, "Father, with great really sadness, I must really give you the possibility to leave your office of the Polish...of the Director of the Polish Catholic Mission, but I take this with a great sorrow because you are needed so much here." So after he wrote me this letter, I really asked him to nominate his successor. And he said the best thing would be that he who has helped the Polish mission during your concentration camp, may now take that...uh...office instead of your __. You see this was the case of the decision to send me to honorary camp. That is to say I was unable to go back to Poland. Unable also to work in France because they would...they communists would have suspicioned that I just had left...left my office, but still not being officially called</p><p> Director, I still infiltrate all the possibility...possibility sections and bring...bring really for them great losses. So the General asked me to come to Rome for some months. I was helping him a little here and there, and then from America he has received some petitions from...uh...congregations of Sisters to send some priest to America who would give them retreats. You know what a treat is? Yes. And so he asked me whether I would go. "Of course, if you wish." And so I came to America. And being here, I was invited...uh...to give retreats in many places so I was traveling from place to place. I was even asked to come to South Africa. Twice I was there. And to Canada. And always busy, busy _____. And after 20 years of giving retreats, you see, I had to...uh...relax because of the constant traveling and in 1968. T received the nosition of Proner Sorrow. of collese nerson and then in <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> 5 and Christian philosophy in college. And...uh...during the last years of my teaching, I received some special privilege. That is to say, in 72 and something 70, I was nominated as outstanding educator of America, a honor for me. Yes. And...uh...then I had to stay with my societv --~ and I now am the Director of Infant Jesus Shrine. That is to sav some charter <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
