A lot of people they escaped from Germany. I don't know how it will be when we left; no the father didn't want to leave. He say we stay in our village. He say the Germans say we will work, we work and we will cooperate, for working. No, it was a big difference. Not only to work. They began to kill us. That begins the trouble.

When I take the money from the stores, they bring all the money to me and I put them in the bank to Menibish. When it begins the war, I got money, I got the government's money. Then they come to me at nighttime, the Ukrainian people to take the money. When overnight left, it was possible to have money, it was government's money. We didn't left, we stayed. Maybe in a couple of days, they come to me at nighttime, the Ukraine people and say give the money and you have gun. I didn't need a gun, I never got a gun.
