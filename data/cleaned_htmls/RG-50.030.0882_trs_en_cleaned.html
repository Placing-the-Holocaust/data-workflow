<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Then it doesn't matter. It doesn -- in -- in that sense, it doesn't matter. It -- what I'm after is, the incidents where you experienced them not speaking to you any more, can you tell us more about that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: It was just -- we didn't -- we didn't stay in the same places, we just -- they didn't walk where I walked, and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Would you see th --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- they wouldn't make any attempt to contact me.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I saw her picture. And so, somebody asked me, did you contact her?

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did the rejection ever come in a very obvious way?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, it was subtle. But you know, this is part of my upbringing.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It -- it helped me when I came to this country, which is, of course, much later, and we may come to that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes, yes. So, did your level of living change much in 1933 to "36, those first years of Hitler being in power?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It did later on, yes, because for instance, you couldn't have a maid any more, that was under 45, because that's when those -- when they couldn't have children any more, and they didn't want to work for Jews. So we had a part time maid, over 46.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see. I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And our apartment was smaller by then, because my mother couldn't take care of anything big. And I guess the money wasn't there either, I don't know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Were your parents less -- how was their manor? Did their manor change, as time went on? Were they less happy? Were they more worried?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Not to -- they didn't show it to us.

He had a friend in London, and that friend had a friend -- an English friend, who was in amer -- who was a Quaker, a British Quaker.
