He went to Sachsenhausen and he died. So my mother said...asked them what he died from. He said, "Well, he did have an infection." If she want the ashes, she have to send five hundred mark; and then she can get the ashes. So I don't know what ashes we got; over my mother sent the five hundred mark, and got the ashes from somebody, at least. So we buried him on the gra...grave of my father. The other...other brothers, and my youngest brother with his wife--he picked up his wife and then he begged them him to send where they send her. So they did.

When I came to the police station, they asked me if I know someone name from people what live illegal. So I say, "Yes, I do. But I don't think so that I will tell you one, because you got me and this is enough." So they say, "Are you stupid? You know somebody got you in here as..." And I didn't know it. I didn't know. So she...I said, "Well, who did?" So they showed the the the handwriting from this girl; and they said, "Did you know her?" I said, "Yeah, I know her." And they told me the whole story; how she got...how they got my name. And I said, "Well, this is OK." So then from there, from this--this were a police station, not far away from my sister's house--they brought me and brought me to the big police, where the jail is. They put me over there in the jail. I don't know why. And they left me over there. I think, months and months I was sitting in that jail house. I don't why.</p><p>But I was sitting there. So then one time, this... the warden comed and said, "Just come with us." So I went with him and they brought me over there to the Jewish lag...camp in... in Berlin for the... So I said, uh, "What did you do with me?" He say, "We're..." He didn't say, "I send you to Auschwitz." He say, "I...we are send you to Poland." I say, "OK." So I went in there. And then I said--I was together with two girls. They want all Jewish people what after a while going on the transport to Auschwitz. So my transport took out the next day. And I said, "Not me. I'm not going out of here." So I...I got out. My mind was made up. I didn't want to go. So the two girls went up in the morning. I said to them, "Did you went already to along that you washed yourself?" "No." I said, "Go ahead, go ahead. I went already." So I was by myself in the room, and this were the second floor; and uh the...the...uh I saw the...the police going down on the bottom. Up and down looking, you know, up and somebody ran away.
