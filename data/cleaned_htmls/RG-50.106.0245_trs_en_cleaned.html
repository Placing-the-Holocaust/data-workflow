In Johannesburg Moshe was chazzan the shul. The shul was 1500 seats. But we have 2100 members. So 600 people davened  <span class="page-break" number="97"></span> Interview with Moshe Kraus aa November 30, 2014</p><p> every Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur in the hall, that made it [indecipherable].</p><p>So Moshe brought this Singer to be the chazzan in the hall. But the Singer never was a chazzan, he was an opera singer. So we brought him a fa -- I don't know, a week or two earlier. And day and night, and literally day and night, he taught him, learn si-- he could read. He knew the davening, he was a Jewish -- I told you a Jew, but he didn't know the nusach, and chazzan is not just singing, it's nusach. I don't even know what I'm talking about, yeah?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: --to Johannesburg to be the chazzan, and he got -- he could take the money out, because he was a foreigner, and he took it back to -- to -- to Prague, and they had money extra. Prague was very bad at that time, I -- I'd have to tell you, because I remember I was asking the hotel if they have an orange. They looked at me -- and it was winter -- they looked at me as if--as if I'm asking a diamond. An orange, winter, th-they didn't ha -- they didn't have food. The only place -- yeah, yeah, we took -- they had one store for the tourists, and there was everything, and also for the communist, for the high --</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="98"></span>  102 Interview with Moshe Kraus November 30, 2014</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah, yeah, for the high ranking -- A2: So, because we were tourists, we took him, you remember, to the store, and we bought him -- I remember he bought sour cream, we never -- sour cream for the children.

Okay, so this" Il -- yeah, later, later, we came to London, Moshe came to London, yeah, and he went to the chief rabbi, tell him the story. So the chief rabbi said, first of all, what we have to do, we have to take out the family, because how can we take -- because we -- we can't take children without family, it's important. So what did we do? They made co -- a fake --a fi--a fictional -- fiction contract, is that fiction, no. Yeah?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Fictional, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>A2: Fictional contract with a certain -- with a shul that the rabbi arranged. They invited this Mr. Singer to be a chazzan in the shul for three years.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In London?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>A2: In London, and go to the government to show them the contract, and tell them we are going for three years, and why the -- and they allowed him to take the whole family, why? Because in London they -- they have -- I don't have other city in the  <span class="page-break" number="99"></span>  103 Interview with Moshe Kraus November 30, 2014 world, but London has an international school, every language.

<dialogue class=""><p><p>A2: Yeah. And -- and there were -- he was in London for a short while, and then Moshe worked to bring them to Johannesburg. How do you bring a family from the communist country to Johannesburg? Impossible. South Africa didn't have any connection with any -- any diplomatic connection with those cun -- any of the countries, communist countries then. So how -- and how can you bring a family? I remember the public prosecutor in Johannesburg, Dr. Yuta(ph) was a great friend of ours, so Moshe went to tell him the story. Said I want to bring a family. They're Jews, they're not communists, I -- I guarantee, and I want to bring them here. So, remember what Yuta(ph) told you? It ma -- it made so he said, when here will grow  <span class="page-break" number="100"></span>  104 Interview with Moshe Kraus November 30, 2014 hair, the government will allow a family to co-- a communist country family to come to South Africa.

He said -- he told him the story, and he burst out crying. He said, I am a Jew, he is a Jew. He is not a communist, he wants to run away from the co -- do -- and he burst out crying, and he touched this man's heart, and he gave -- he ba -- he gave him the visas for five people.</p></p></dialogue>
