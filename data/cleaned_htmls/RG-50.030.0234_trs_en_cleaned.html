<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. Well, on the 22nd of June, the war break out. Early in the morning we hear the bombardment and over the radio it was war. The very simple word of war took me and I was all the time attached to the radio and then the Kovno was bombarded and all...first of all the air...the airport and then the military and then all the town was in flames, so we tried to escape and the the Russians, the Soviets were taken by surprise and they rushed out of Kovno. They left the prison closed without any guards, and the prisoners went at night, found that there were no no guards and so from inside they break through and they went to to freedom, but the...I and everybody tried to get any vehicle to run away from the bombardment and I was at that time with my sister at my sister's home and my sister and my my brother-in-law were waiting for a relative of my brother-in-law to take them after midnight with a wagon with horses because when when...if you would go in in daytime, they would take them away, uh these these horses and save them for the military and while waiting there, twelve o'clock, one o'clock, I was so much impressed and overwhelmed of the of the of the Germans. It was just terrible, so I found a <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> me here, for two pages on both sides I have written from twelve to two thirty after midnight when the man came with his wagon to take us out of town and this is the first entry in in my diary and I have it here with me. And then I tried to escape and I did not succeed. On the way what I...I took a bicycle and I almost let's say uh seventy miles I made by bicycle towards the frontier with with Russia but in the meantime the Germans caught us up and I had to go back. The story of going back to Kovno is a story that is radiate with me for another book, that is not include in this diary.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Why? What happened?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Because immediately on each and every corner, fromeachandevery __, Lithuanian partisans, so-called partisans, they attacked Jews. They took off from them every valuable. They took the money. The Lithuanians didn't give...didn't sell bread for those retreating and so | saw that it is dangerous to go on the highway, so we...I left the highway and I went through the fields, you know, through gardens, forests, all around. It took me three days to go back to Kovno. Three days and three nights and this is a story.</p><p>I could be ten times killed because the bombardments were without end.

It was every time in the , used to live <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: By myself, yes. I will tell you why by myself. I was married then, but to be where of the opinion that the only in danger are the men that the Germans might take them to work for the army, and therefore the men used to run away. Others who hadto __ full families, so I went and I had left my first wife at home because her parents and so on, but I didn't succeed. And so it took me three days to come back to Kovno and these three days, I wrote fifty-four pages how...what happened to me because I went...everyplace I could encounter a a Lithuanian extremist, fascist would kill on the spot. I didn't have the money to pay them for a piece of bread. Before they used to give bread and milk, the Lithuanian, you know. It's no problem...bread...eat. Everybody would offer you bread and milk. But then they paid and then they didn't take the rubles. They asked for coins...uh golden coins and so on. It wasaterrible__, so finally I...to cut a long story short... finally came to the outskirts of Kovno and it was in...in Kovno there was a famous...a a famous and most neglected suburb of Slobodka (ph). The Slobodka is a center...world center of scholars of . But it was a very much <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> to Slobodka, a suburb of Kovno, youknow, _.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I didn't believe but she told me don't go because you will be killed, so it was enough for me. So she said the best thing what you can do, you cross the River Yemen (ph). There is a boat. You will...you are on a boat and it will take you over there and then you go up to the...to...and this is what I've done, and this is the way I rescued my life. And when I came...came back home and uh it was entirely a different Kovno. The Jews were closed themselves up behind the...behind the curtains and closed doors. They didn't go to the...to the shops and to their businesses because the Lithuanians already started to to attack Jews whenever they could met them in the...in the street. They dragged them from their coattails, dumped them from buildings, from their apartments. They used to rape women and it was a terrible situation that that was absolutely...they used to go...the streets of Kovno were full of groups of uh partisans leading groups of Jews in a circle and either to prison and when the prison was full, they them to certain uh <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 0</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Of course I've seen it, because I am not a man to close myself behind...behind the shelter.</p><p>So I went out in the street and I wanted to know what's going on, what is the community, what is this, what is that? So I...so I was told that the chief rabbi's home, not at his office because the Bolsheviks (ph) annulled all the Jewish institutions at the time of the occupation of the...so I went to the chief rabbi's office and there I could learn that some community leaders are uh are are get together and are consulting, exchanging information, seeing what can be done, and then I I used to come almost everyday to that place and when the the they organized...when the...when the the...when the order came that Jews have to...the expulsion of Jews from Kovno to the ghetto, latest until 15th of October...of uh August 1941. That means within a month's time, all Jews from Kovno, approximately thirty-five thousand but you know, five thousand was killed in the in the unrest before that, so they should be...should be in the ghetto, and on this 15th of August, 1930...1941, Kovno should be Judenrad (ph)...clean of Jews.</p></p></dialogue>

He had a stomach uh trouble and there wasa____ going inside this uh his body to digest, you see, so he showed them that he cannot move, so they told him give us names of uh of public community leaders, so he gave them three names. One was the Garfunkle (ph) who was a member of the parliament. His underworld was Jacob Goldberg, a also a lawyer who was the head of the volunteers for the Lithuanian independence for a officer, and the third one was Dr. Rabinovitch (ph) who was a...he studied in Germany and and he was well-acquainted. He was a physician. So they went and took all three of them separately and brought them to...they didn't tell them where they're taking them, what they take them, what for...nothing. They just brought them to the Gestapo and there where were they summoned before going into the chief of the Gestapo. The chief asked either anyone among these three are rabbis and they say no, so ordered they should bring a rabbi or two so they went and brought two rabbis. One rabbi was the chap...chaplain, the chief chaplain in the Lithuanian army and the other was Schumuckler (ph), Rabbi Schumuckler from who was...became very famous later and uh the Rabbi Schumuckler was quiet. The chaplain all the time say uh you know, the prayer before death, yousee. ------&lt;&lt;,____--_--.-~_ Because he was sure that they are taking him to death, and when they brought in they they they took them in into the office, there were two gentlemen. One was a General Pole who was the commander of the of the German forces in in Lithuania. The second one was uh ___ who was the</p><p> furher of the Gestapo, chief of the Gestapo. And uh the general told them, <span class="page-break" number="11"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 3 arrested and these...we came here to bring order and we cannot let this this situation go on. The Lithuanians say they don't want to dwell with you, so you must go to the ghetto.</p><p>So uh Garfunkle who was a member of the Parliament and he was...said let us talk to the Lithuanians. He says with which Lithuanians do you want to talk? They don't want to talk to you. They don't want to live, to dwell with you. And uh but if..-you have to go to the ghetto and the ghetto is near Slobodka and he had a map calling that all of the area of Slobodka should be earmarked for the ghetto so the Jews said, the commission...in Slobodka lived in the old times eight thousand people while in in Kovno there are thirty thousand Jews. How do you want to squeeze in? So he says alright. Uh you can take another place. Anyhow uh uh so he says we are not authorized to give announcement with regard to to being expelled from the city. We have to think and to explain to to...so he says I give you time until tomorrow at ten o'clock. Bring us...if your reply will be positive, I'll order that this should immediately stop, these killings and and robbing of foods and raping of women...it should stop immediately and in addition, I will order to release three thousand women and children who are in in the prisons and in the fort under arrest and this was a very great incentive to the to the to the thoughts of the Jews, and then they met again at the at the rabbi's office. I was there all the time and they decided...uh said that there's no way out other ways. There was no way. Not they will not go. Said they will expel us, and this is...they gave...order gave that it was from the 10th...formally the 10th of July was published the order in all in all the papers and the radio, on the walls. You know, there are so I took...what did I take, several, and what will maybe . And then later they gave an order that the Jews <span class="page-break" number="12"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 4 should elect...should nominate an overjuder (ph). It means aa chief Jew. A chief Jew.</p><p>And all these nominations Altestenrat (ph). Altestenrat means a council of elders, to remind you the elders of Zion. You understand? All these aimed to one, to dehumanize, to to degrade, to hurt the feelings of Jews and . And this was the most dramatic and the most historic last meeting of the Jewish community in Kovno.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Why?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: On the 4th of August, 1941, at a school, there set the most prominent leaders of the community were still alive, because many were already killed. Approximately five thousand Jews were killed on the roads, in the city and so on and then they...it was opened...the assembly was opened by Dr. who one was very veteran leaders of the Jewish community in Kovno...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you were there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I couldn't be in the assembly with those . Because I I...you know, I Iam <span class="page-break" number="13"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 5</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: When they came back from the committee, I will not enlarge what happened to them.</p><p>They were arrested on the way from the from the Gestapo to their homes by Lithuanians and they were...and among these uh...there...Goldberg was a mili...a military officer, a high officer in the Lithuanian army. He tried to speak to the military commandant of Kovno who he knew. He was in the same military school and this the night... we have to make it short, so this Goldberg went to one of his fellows who was well-known.</p><p>There was established a big new ministry, as if they would gain their independence, the Lithuanians. They sent cables of gratitude to Hitler signed by the Archbishop _, by the Bishop , thanking him for liberating uh Lithuania from the Soviets, you see, <span class="page-break" number="14"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 6 ___,the___--sin the past, the ___ end was so that we survived them and he hoped that omens of this type Hitler will also...his end will be the _in the history of Jewish people, but nevertheless in describing the terrible situation of the Jews, the desperate situation, he collapsed and he couldn't continue to talk. Then came the problem the order of the Germans is that the Jews have to nominate a chief Jew and if the Jews themselves will not nominate a chief Jew, they will nominate themselves, and we had already the terrible experience of other places where they nominated, you know, a man who has no responsibility, with no background, no way...so there was also among the candidates was Dr. Elkes. The first candidate was, of course, Garfunkle who was a member of the Parliament, the head of the Jewish faction in the Parliament, for instance that Goldberg who had uh wasaaafront _, a fighter for Lithuanian independence. They had but they they absolutely refused to take over the office because they knew this is going to beaservant _ and into the of the of the Germans or the Nazis, and nobody wanted to be to betray his his his community, the Jewish people. More so that at that time we knew already that the the chief Jew from Vilna (ph), Dr. , very famous Jewish leader, <span class="page-break" number="15"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 7 his relationship being a private doctor for the German ambassador, he might have have some influence and maybe do some good or avoid some hardships and so on, but of course this had nothing to with that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did he respond to the nomination?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He...I will tell you before I answer. He said no because the...according to the Germans, who have to go to the ghetto, there we will have a municipality for ourselves. We will have our own community, a closed community. No Lithuanians will be will be allowed.</p><p>No no German will be allowed to go inside. You will be free to manage your life as well you can, so each was supposed to be a municipal...a a chairman of a municipal council, so Dr. Elkes says I have no experience at all in municipality, in municipality...municipal work. I never have done anything but physician. He was the head of the interior department of the Jewish big hospital in Lithuania, Bikkur Holim, and he was...I said I was all my life a doctor and I have no any whatsoever experience in in municipal work.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So what persuaded him?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So then...so then it was a stalemate. Nobody...and the Germans said if we will not nominate, they will nominate and this was the worst thing that could happen to us and before long in despair, then stood up the the rabbi, Rabbi Schumuckler and he said,</p><p> . Lappeal to Dr. Elkes. Everybody...since you are the most...are the most <span class="page-break" number="16"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 8</p><p> suitable to be a head of whole community in this unusual, unique time of rest...risks and despair.

Everybody was in tears. He was so emotional and he was so persuasive, and Dr. Elkes stood in the corner. He never never stood ____, and he stood up and he said, if you all think that I must...it is me that must lead, the chief juden, the overjuden, I'm here. He sacrificed himself for the community</p><p> , and when he said I am here, he says you, so this was in great relief in the in in in in the whole and everybody stood up on his leg...on their feet and they actually</p><p> and they shake...shook hands with him.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Why did you have such faith in him?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I'll tell you. There was not a person in Lithuania that didn't know the best...the the doctor but in addition I knew Dr. Elkes because the only thing that he was...he was never a mem...member of any Zionist party, was never any committees.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: He...let me tell you. First of all, you should know Elkes was born not far away from my town like Kalvarija (ph) and there he got a very strong religious education. There were no schools in...at that time...he was born in "70...in 1870 more or less. At that time there were no schools.

He was a very rich man and mind you, I want to jump now...in his...in his last will, in the ghetto he wrote in the ghetto in 1943 in Hebrew language, which he gave...handed over to me before I escaped from the ghetto, he he didn't mention not a single word of his of his richness. It was a very big property in this in this most fashionable part of the city of Kovno. His children he sent, because of being a rich man, he sent his two children, his son and his daughter, to London and this is Professor ___ Elkes who you met in there, he was then in London, and this is the last will that they allowed to him and to his sister, and this is will that to be passed to him (laughter) before I escaped from the ghetto.</p><p>Nobody knew will I at all succeed in to pass through and so on, so he was a great Zionist, a great Jew, a great devoted Jew with a very deep feeling of Jewish heritage. He had a responsibility and when he took over, he was known only as a physician, only as a great physician and we gave trust in him because of his special relationship with the German ambassador, but then he had shown himself by his day-to-day daily steps, dealing with the Russians. For instance...I'l give you an instance...</p></p></dialogue>

We know that hundred grams of bread per day per person who works is not enough, so we want to enlarge this portion for those who are working and to leave the portions that are now only for those who don't work in order to make sure who is...these who are working, so we want that you should...all...all the inmates of the ghetto, thirty thousand, should report on the 28th of October on the big square democratic, families-wise and groups of working-wise, you see, and then when they make they make uh divide separately in one place those who are working hard and those get double rations and those who are don't work will get the same rations as now. So Dr. Elkes said if this should be done, he said, we can do it ourselves. We take...give you the list of the people __ ourselves out of department of supply, we'll give double rations to those who are working and give less rations, the same rations to those who are not. For that purpose, you don't need all of the 30,000 inmates of the ghetto to report on on on the democratic square.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So first of all, the rations that the Germans gave to feed the inmates was a ration for starvation. No one could live on a hundred grams, but also this hundred grams of bread, the uh the inmates didn't...the the the individual inmate didn't get because we had kept secret two thousand souls in the ghetto. Babies that had been born despite the the strict order to cut off pregnancies. Second there were old men or sick men that if you would put them on the register of the in...inmates of the ghetto, they would have been killed, so this two thousand...approximately two thousand had to be...to get food, so we cut off from the general portion that we got uh so everyone got only approximately eighty grams or eighty-five grams of bread so that the others can get also. So each one in his own way tried to get additional food. You couldn't go in in the supermarket and buy it. You couldn't go in because in the ghetto there was nothing, so people used to go to the...to work outside town and there try to get out for ten or fifteen minutes and buy and buy...not buy because nobody sold. It's war time and it were sanctions also in the city but the Lithuanians had enough food but they wanted always to trade in. They would give you a loaf of bread or half a loaf of bread for a pair of trousers or stockings or a jacket or whatever. I...for reason I remember it was the 31st of December, 1942.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's right. Well, I'm talking...we are talking about the escape from the ghetto and not from Kovno. It is two different things. Well, as I already mentioned before, I was one of the four founders of the Zionist underground movement which was a resistance, and we we...there prepared in the very end when the when the ghetto is...before liquidating the ghetto, the leaders will escape to the woods, to the partisan groups, and this was the planning. It was a matter of timing when should we escape from the ghetto and this was a very important question...which one of the four leaders of the Zionist uh resistance movement were all the positions in the ghetto life, so it wasn't just a matter of once a decision. It had to be a decision with the consent of the chairman of the Jewish committee and so on. But it happened so as I also told you that I was very much engaged in this looking and finding a place of hiding for___-- which was then seven years. When I found such a place and the legendary escape of ____ from the ghetto, she fell very ill and when she came into the farm of hiding, it was absolutely necessary that Pnina should go there at least for a week because we couldn't bring a doctor.</p></p></dialogue>

Uhit was very difficult butin___ I 1 I succeeded in finding a contact with a priest who found a place for her hiding and when I took her out from the ghetto, three times I tried and I didn't succeed.

At least Pnina would go, take along with her medicine. We had excellent doctors in the ghetto and she took along and the priest was very opposing it because it was the danger. Anyhow, I said it would have meant nothing if she would die, _, from from illness. It's the same we didn't do nothing, so she was there but instead of being there a week, Pnina stayed there four montheses. And she worked there in the farm in all works as was she was considered as a as a relative, far relative from town that she run away from Kovno from bombardments and from the war, but she was for all things and purposes worked with the with the family and she got very well acquainted with them and uh it was a woman, a widow whose husband, the boss of the farm, fell from a from a thunder...from a thunderstorm and he was buried in in in this farm, and the widow was a very good-hearted, that was very religious, and that's why the priest could talk her in that she should take the child for hiding and uh and uh then she was really happy that Pnina came because she didn't know what to...___--_--s was crying all the time...Momma, Momma...and uh I...as I said she lived there instead of a week, she stood there for about four, five months and then she was acquainted there...one...one...the the woman, the widow had three daughters and one son.

So one day I was surprised by from the priest for me that a wagon will be waiting for for me on the 23rd of February, 1944, for the farm. I was, as I said, prepared to go for the woods but not for the farm, but since I got such a a word from Pnina so it was nothing doing, so I had to escape from the ghetto. The night before...so I told...of course, I told Dr. Elkes about my plans, that I have to escape from the ghetto, and the the last night I spent in the house, in the tiny dwelling of Dr. Elkes, the head of the community, and his deputy Garfunkle and Mrs. Elkes which was a lady in the very full sense of the word. Just a lady, and the two people, I disclosed to them and I told them that my...the hiding place of the five crates of my diary and collection and they should know where it is but Garfunkle, the deputy, said , you cannot do it.

That's why...that's why I think...I'm sure you have courage. You have knowledge.
