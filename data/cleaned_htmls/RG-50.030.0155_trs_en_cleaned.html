<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Meier. Hans Meier. H-A-N-S M-E-I-E-R.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Thank you. Where were you born?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was born in Zurich in Switzerland.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And when?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: 1902 on the 9th of March.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Uh...Tell me about your...your family. Where...where did your parents come from? My father came from a very poor farmer's family in...outside Zurich. And they died from tuberculosis without nourishment. And he was able to make a training as...came as mechanic with his uncle in Zurich, the town of Zurich. And then he got an employment, with the federal railways for locomotives. And he became a...a fireman and locomotive driver. And he therefore he was a bit better off than his family. And he wished to...to put me higher even, and he gave me the opportunity to study electrical engineering at the University of Zurich.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Let's...let's...before we go into college and university, tell me what it was like growing up. Did you have brothers and sisters as a child?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Thad one brother, Fritz, and no...no other sisters or brothers. And...uh...we both...we were two years apart. He was born 1904. And I remember my first memory was sitting in the little carriage seeing a house. That's all. And then later, we went very often on a bridge which crossed the railway tracks near the station in Zurich. And we tried to spit into the chimneys of the locomotives which was passing underneath the road. And very often it happened that at that moment, the locomotive flew back our wet spital and into our own faces. (Laughing) And my father knew that I was on that bridge and he fetched me and had to wash me first before he could take me home. That was my...my childhood memories. And then L..we were living in the workers" quarters of Zurich, not in a...not in the rich quarters, near the station.</p><p>And I.... know my father got better food than I and my...my mother was looking and she came from a poor family in also...but from a cobbler's family.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: What? <span class="page-break" number="0"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Cobbler...cobblers. And...uh...I spent all the holidays there and...uh...but he let me study to see that.... | went 8 years into the public school and then 4 and a half years in to the high school and then for | year I was in a...in a repair shop of locomotives to learn auto mechanics and so on. And then I studied for 4 and a half years electrical engineering and then I tried to get employment with the federal railways. They just changed at that time from steam to electric. That was just after the war. But I have to say first what I experienced during the war. Uh...I...when the war broke out, I was 12.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, this is the first World War?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The first World War. Yeah. And my father was a socialist. That means at that time it meant...uh...idealism for peace and for justice. That was socialism. And he was a delegate at the International Socialist Peace meeting in Basel, 1912, and he returned from Basel, and told me, "Boy, from now on, no more war because when the government declare war, we socialist internationally strike. We don't...don't go. We strike." And 2 years all went...the German Socialists went and killed the French Socialist and the English Socialist and the American, and in addition we experienced that the CHristian churches did the same. They sent their people in the name of Christ to kill many of them. From Germany, from France, Italy, Austria, England, American. And we say this man, Christ, must be a murderer because in his name they sent the young people to murder one another. That was what we thought in our youth. And then Switzerland...and now we experienced in Switzerland the exchange of prisoners of war. Cripples from between France and Germany for instance, crippled prisoners of war who were no more able to go to war. And we saw in this way thousand of people, young people like we are who had been sent to war to kill one another coming crippled back into the fatherland after having been sent by the churches to kill one another.</p><p>And Switzerland, what did they do? They made ammunition for both sides and made a lot of money. I say do it safely, making help on both sides. So that even a man in Switzerland, the very famous writer suggested that in the propaganda for Swiss produce, they should put out the ammunition which they made for the Poles and the photographs of its victims.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What were you doing during all this?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And we were protesting against the whole injustice. We were youths and...uh...you experienced here in the 68s...how the youth protest against the hypocracy of the old generation.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did you protest? What form did you protest?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We...we protested. We heard for instance that the Christian czars in Russia exploited their country. We heard that the Russian czars were saying they were Christians, tried to compel youth...Jews to become Christians. When they came to the army, they baptized them and kept them under water because they protested so that they drowned. And we said, is that Christian? This Christ who says that must be a murderer. We say that in the youth. And we red ting on the side that we stand for that and we had heated discussions about this in the <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> school. And in addition, I visited because my father was a Socialist, I visited the so-called Socialist Sundav School. And we heard there _. They were refugees in <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> bad example. So I was for 3 months in solitary prison in Switzerland. And in this 3 months I got the old testament edition of the old testament ____ I got to read. Because a friend of mine gave it to me to read. I read it as history of the Jewish people and...uh...it didn't make a great impression on me, but...uh...I still have it in mine. And then when I came out, I had no possibility of any employment in Switzerland because when in Switzerland when you are prison, especially I was told that I should not expect any employment in Switzerland after I had refused the most...uh...best service you can do to Switzerland. So I had to go out of Switzerland. And my idea was first to go to Russia. I learned Russian. I still know a few words. Uh...I learned Russia and because Switzerland had no diplomatic relationship with Russia, I had to go to Berlin to get the visa for Russia. On the way to Berlin which I went on...on bike, all on bike because I had no money to travel by train. So I visited a quite few free communities on the way. For instance, at Bruderhof, I was invited and...uh...but the Bruderhof, I was 3 weeks in all, but there were two Christian for me (Laughing) after what I experiences in Christian churches. And then I met...uh...in Holland, I met a , who according to the bible had given away his whole property. He was a rich man and he had given away all the property to the poor, but he said, "To whom should I give it? If give it away to the poor, I'll make the poor rich. So what's the difference?" And therefore he gave it back to the workers, who had worked for the riches, and they did not accept it. They made a foundation from the man which they gave back to help poor people, poor children, poor . And he said, "But now, it's not sufficient only to give away property. I have to work." Therefore, they started to live in community because community...uh...made it clear that everybody gives what he has and everybody receives what he needs. That is community.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What did they call this community?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> At -- But this communitv had disanneared after 4 or 5 vears because thev <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> have...wish to have any conscientious objector in Berlin, so I didn't the visa for Russia. So I had to leave to work...to seek work in Germany. In Switzerland, I didn't get any work. And in Germany, there was still the Weimer Republic, which had been forbidden by Warsaw to have an army. There were only 100,000 people...soldiers for police. And so I...when I had to report...reply for the police for...uh...for..-uh... education in Germany, they asked me, "Have you been in prison?" I said, "Yes." "For what?" "For military purposes." "Oh, that doesn't bother us," they said, "because we have no such question." So I got in Germany permission to radicate.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: To what? I'm sorry.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Germany.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Permission to radicate...to..to settle. And...uh.. then ..uh__] sot work bv the seaman 7 <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> He's an Austrian. He is an illegit and a chld. He's only...he's not a studied man...he's only a house painter. And he has a grandfather...illegitimate grandfather who is a Jew. Do you that he ever gets to the power in Germany? No. Everybody laughed. And 5 years later he was there in democratic fashion, because according to democratic rules, he...he became chancellor.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Let's...let's stay with you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not... and knowing...the people knew exactly what he represented. In any case, we stopped the work and after 2 years in...in Germany, and we started ourselves a community in Switzerland. And because we said how is it possible that people...the whole humanity can become socially just and in peace. We have to do it ourself before we can expect from the others. We have to experience it ourselves whether it's possible. And...and secondly if we represent that people can only believe us if we do it ourselves. So the question is always that we don't expect from the others to do things, but we do it ourselves first of things. And so therefore this reason we started to live in community, idealistic community like the kibbutz from idealism and peace and justice that we represented that we lived that. (clearing throat) But then we made experience that there were as many ideas as there were idealists, and we couldn't come to common unity as community expresses, and we were looking around.</p><p>Where is that unity that we found? And we found it only in the will of God. Only if we all do the will of God, then we become united. And so we after 3 years, we joined the Bruderhof in Germany who represented that. Christ...Christ for us...Christ is not the founder of the Christian churches. The Christian churches do exactly the opposite of what Christ said.</p><p>(Clearing throat) For instance...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: No. Please. Stop for a moment. Take some water. Take some kleenex. Take your time.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How long...you...you joined the Hutterian Brotherhood. Was it called that at that time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was so. 1930 we started in Switzerland to live in community, (clearing throat) and there right in the beginning a pastor came to us with a family of four children. And he said, "Look here. Can I join you? Because I preach but I don't do. I don't live really a brotherly life. I have a nice house as a pastor and I have nice (coughing) income. Can I join you?" And one of our...we were three families, three couples who started...who came from the same youth movement. And...uh...one family was more Christian than we. And they said, "Look, go to the Bruderhof and learn there how to live in community. And then come back and teach us." And they went and stayed...1930. And then the Bruderhof was always concerned because they felt very much that we were seeking that unity, fighting for it....uh...struggling for it, but didn't find. And therefore when the second family wished to go away...the second...another family who was one of the founders of our community...they wished to go off the same. We don't find unity. It's finished. And they were given the advice also to go to the Bruderhof first.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: The Bruderhof? <span class="page-break" number="4"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The Bruderhof had already 10 years or 12 years proven that they have...could fight through to unity the whole time. And so they went. And they also remained in the Bruderhof. And so then they Bruderhof came more and more interested in our community, and tried to help us.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>And then they sent a letter to us...1933 in January, challenging us. And on this my wife said, "That's the thing which we need." I said, "I'm...I'm not quite sure about that." And I for the first time in my life was asking God... start to say, "What do you think? What should I do?" And I got somehow a confirmation that I should go at least to find out what is on the Bruderhof. And so I come with my wife and a son. We had Klaus, who was at that time 10 minutes old. And then...in the Bruderhof'I sat, so to say, in the corner and looked through like an vou know what.. what's the matter here? And then I found out that the true <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> to that letter. But we heard later that Hitler was asking when he was at the headquarters of a maneuvering nearby whether we live up there on that place. So he knew something about us.</p><p>And we read...we sent also letters to the Gestapo to...to the Governor, to the Hinderburg, to Hitler, to...oh...to everybody in the thing, saying quite clearly where we stand. And then...</p><p>uh...came the which Klaus alreadv snoke in which Hitler asked the neonle in <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> out whether there's a possibility for...in all Bruderhofs of the 16th century go in case we are no more tolerated in Germany. But...uh...] have the recommendation letter to Masserick, Tomas Masserick, the President of that time. A very good recommendation or letter from Switzerland from a friend of his, but he was sick and...and his secretary...press secretary helped me very much. And they found out that all the old places were under the protection of the...law which protected history. And but they offered us lands. Luckily, we never had to accept that. I went back to Switzerland and I had no news for a fort night and I didn't know whether the Bruderhof still existed. So I went first to the Umslatz and I tried to find out and nobody could tell whether the Bruderhof still existed. And so in the night I sneaked up the Bruderhof to find out that the Bruderhof still is there. And it was still there.</p><p>(Laughing) And I told my experiences, and on this a teacher...this__ left the children for Switzerland illegally.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You went back to Germany to see whether it was still there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. Yeah. And find out that they're still there. And then we were sent to Swiss, to Berlin, to find out what the Gestapo has in mind. We went to the...to the top...uh...directors of the Gestapo in Berlin and they...they found out that the cheeky, cheeky, to tried to find out of the Gestapo what they have in mind. And the man who had the whole thing in his hands, he read the minutes which he...which they took...uh...while they were waiting the Bruderhof, they took the minutes with them, and I brought the other minutes to Switzerland by the way to bring them to safety not...the Gestapo asked for. And there he read to us, "Look here. You represent publicly that the present state of Hitler shows most clearly the character of every state as the beast for the . "If you still think we are the beast and we are this and represent that, I close you down immediately," said the Gestapo. But I cannot only close you down if the government is in agreement. And the government was not in agreement. You know why? We found only out after the war...after the war. They tried to find out...no one of our members in North America married the daughter of an employee of the State Department here, in Washington...uh...Nelson. And he visited us and I asked him, "Can't you find the archive of Hitler, at that time about this?" "Why." He said he gave us the address and telephone number and I inquired here in Washington, and they didn't have anything, and thev referred us to - But thev didn't find anvthine in communist countrv. <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> 0 not resist them when they visited us with the 150 armed men, we must have taken cocaine.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Must have taken what?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Cocaine. Cocaine.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: They said you have must have taken cocaine because you didn't resist them?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. Yeah. Because we were friendly to them, whatever...for refusing. And so you must be drug addicts on which the governor says everybody knows this is a swindle. We can't do that. We have to find another reason. And the other reason which the governor suggested was to...to take over all our houses and lands for military purposes because the Americans do the same. They can't say we are persecuting Christians. You understand? And they...Hitler at that time did not wish to have a bad impression of Germany in America. He wished to have a good impression. Not that he persecutes Christians. And therefore it went forward and backward between Gestapo, them...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What were you doing during all this period?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: What? What?</p></p></dialogue>

You are not obedient to the <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> 1</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Very....practically nobody. Not even the Jews. We have two Jewish family among us, and we brought them to the...uh...Lichenstein to be out of the country that they were not persecuted. And...uh...and the question was this. We represented that, but nobody was listening.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When you went to Pasteur Neumueller, what did he tell you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And he told us, "Look here. You I can't you together. I can't give that witness what you give because you are disobedient to the government because you don't want to do military service for them." I would do military service if the government ask me to do it. But I would not be obedient if the government would try to hinder me to...to</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Move your hand away. I can't hear you. Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: If the government would hinder me to sermon...to do a sermon on the pure word of God.</p><p>And we told him, "Look here. The pure word of God doesn't exist here, only of , but of __. And the ___ means that you should love your enemy; that the revenge is in God's hands and not in our hands as the prophets say. The prophets say the whole time again and again, "People don't revenge yourself. Leave the revenge to me." Yeah. The Prophets say that the whole time. And we say we represent that. And they said, "No, we have to obey the government." And then you know, he was...he had that sermon in Berlin against the persecution of the Jews and he was accused. And then the church had no law against that and let him go free. When Hitler heard that, he put him into concentration camp as his personal prisoner.</p></p></dialogue>

And he was for 8 years in concentration camp and the prison wardens tried to tease him the whole time by executing prisoners before his window.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Let us...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And then he said each time these criminals, these swine and really saw one man who said, "Forgive them. They don't know what they do?" And then he changed his attitude. And from that moment on. nobody listened what That was the fact. <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> 2</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was 1933, 1934.</p></p></dialogue>

And then the Lichenstein government told us in confidence, "Look here. Hitler has already asked for these chaps. Go..go that we...because we are too small a country to resist Hitler and take away the young chaps. And so had to found the Bruderhof in England community. And we had to send them there. And I...now it happened the following. At the same at just at that moment, France closed its frontier for all Germans because Hitler with his illegal army had illegally occupied the Rhineland, and France in its anger closed all of France, and so how should we get...get the young chaps from Lichenstein to England?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I mean we went to Italy because there we did not need any visas. And we tried to get the ship from Geneva, but there was no ship to England from Geneva because the League of Nations had put an embargo on Italy because of the attack on Abssinia. And therefore we had to sneak across the frontier. And we went alone the Riviera to _ and the weather was verv <span class="page-break" number="13"></span> 6 transported back to Geneva as spies and to be delivered up to Germany. And I asked this man...this police...Italian policeman, "Look here. You know that you have no spies." And they said suddenly, "Who are you? Are you a Franciscan?" And I...because I tried in my Italian to explain to him how we missed...and I told him in my poor Italian how we missed the community, and he said in the end, "Look here. I believe you that you are no spies, but I can't cross both eyes. I...but I close one eye, and push you over the frontier." (Laughing) Just what we wished. And he paid even a stranger to the frontier and then they pushed us over the Italian frontier into the France. And then they put their stamps all on the last pages of our passport, and when we arrived at the French frontier the man was only looking for the Italian stamps and didn't see that there were German passports and let us go. And then he accompanied us to the police and said you have to announce to the police and the police neither discovered that they were German passports. Let us go through! Then we arrived by...the last minute we gave to the express train to Paris...Paris. And we went through from...uh...Nice to Paris where we ride express train and arrived in Paris without money, without visa. And then we phoned to England and they sent us some money telegraphically that we could travel on. When we arrived in , the man French man said that look here.</p><p>How can I put the leave taking stamp in your passports when you have no entry stamps?</p><p>What should I do? I can only deliver you to...to Germany?" And I begged him and said, "Look here. We just leave now France. Have a bit of patience." And in the end, he put the entry stamp before his out stamp in the passports and let us go. And then we arrived in England and the English man said, "Do you wish to come in by the back door when you have been thrown out by the front door?" Because one of the three with whom I traveled had been by air to London and refused entry into England because he was not fetched and counted by an English brethren , and he didn't know any word of English. And so he...and the end one of our brothers who fetched us in...in...uh...in Liverpool...in South Hampton, could convince the English man that we are innocent and he gave us 2 months of...of ...</p><p>uh...stay in England.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What did you do while you were in England?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And then we arrived on the nlace which was later the Bruderhof. and thev were <span class="page-break" number="14"></span> 7</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Go ahead.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And then returned to Germany. And...uh...I took over the stewardship there and was...uh...and I put in...in the... in the...uh..in that bookkeeping the capital which we invested in the Bruderhof. In 1937, the Gestapo was stronger than the government, and they dissolved us against the government. And...uh...they confiscated everything. And I asked them....they came with 150 men armed. I asked them, "Why do you come?" They said, "We come to dissolve you. Everybody goes home and the Germans come to do military service." And we said, "No, we don't do that. We just left home to live in community and our mili...our Germans don't do military service." So they were flabbergasted and then they discovered that two Americans were there, just by chance...so called chance. And they said, "These Americans can't go back to North America and say that Hitler persecutes Christians. That they can't have. Therefore, they have to find...they have to find another reason. And they found the following reason. They said, "Pay your debts." And I told them, "Look here. After you confiscated everything, with what should I pay my debts? If you give back what...what they have taken away, we can pay it." Then they said, "No. We don't do it." And they went to creditor, and he signed under their pressure a letter which he accused us of swindle because didn't pay..pay him the debts. Although I have told the Gestapo I have to recuperate that they gave back, what they have...and shortly before we got the...the visit of a ...of a group of people, experts. They looked at the houses and the land. They said, "Look here. We buy all this and pay you the whole price and you have that for military purposes." And so I had in my hand...I had the promise that they would get the money for all..for all my debts.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What happened then?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And then they said, "You committed falsification of the balance sheet because you put in...uh...much higher value than the balance sheet for what is there than what it was." And the thing was the following. The Gestapo confiscated everything and then put it on auction.</p><p>The whole...all the things. And he was only offered say 40,000 marcs instead of 180,000 marcs. And so they said because they are offered only 40,000 marcs...only valued 40,000 marcs, you put a wrong number into your balance sheet. You understand?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Is it clear?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It's quite clear.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Under this...and now the thing was the following. They...they asked us...the...the commission or the directive commission...or they forced them, the directive commission of their association official, they asked us to come to the governor and to consider what are they going to do now. And we said, "Look here. If you throw us out, we would like to go to our communities in Lichenstein in England and all of our military people can go there. And they <span class="page-break" number="15"></span> 8 had to agree to with that because they knew two Americans were there observing them the whole time and therefore they arranged that...that the the Americans had to promise to pay to journey in case we would not pay the journey. And so they advanced the money for the journey to England and to Lichenstein for our people. And then when the whole thing was ended six policeman showed up and took us into custody of security. Not...not because we are falsified...uh...they accused of...lot later...because we had falsified balance sheet, but for our own security. You know, the security...and put us into prison and only after a fortnight, the judge accepted the accusation of false... false...uh...balance sheet, swindled balance sheet.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What happened to you? What...where did you go?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And then we were...we were taken to prison. And then the prison was changed from security prison into criminal prison.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You were charged quickly.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: We were charged with that, and then the judge had to trans...to investigate that this was true or not. And then the Gestapo took our fingerprints and photographs and everything and we protested. We said, "Look here. The whole thing is a big swindle. Uh...It's not true because the whole thing is much more value than what you think...uh...people offer. And...uh...you know, that's all a swindle." They laughed. They laughed. They said, "Look here. You are enemies of the state. In case the church lets you go, we fetch you to concentration camp." And so we sat 3 months in prison with the promise of the Gestapo to fetch us to concentration camp any day. And the judge let us go. And the judge must have had some...some...uh... qualms in his heart because he let us go 2 days before the Gestapo knew about it so that we had 2 days advance. And the judge the week before, our German member...we were two Swiss and one German, our German member was called into military service. And we said, "No." And as the commanding officer to whom we wrote that letter was not present, they said, "Go back to prison where he can't escape us. We'll fetch you next week from prison where you can't escape us, and to go to military service." And just the same Saturday, the judge let us go. And he told our lawyer and our lawyer told a friend of us with his car to fetch us from prison and he took us away from prison as quickly as possible, as far as possible. And then they came...I had no passport because the Gestapo had my passport. How do you get out of Germany? You could get anywhere, but not without passport. So I went to the Swiss Consulate in Frankfort and asked him...uh...to give me passport. And they gave me a passport without any papers. Nothing. Just because they knew me that I was conscious objector. And..uh...and then I...we sneaked...we had to sneak across the Dutch frontier because the...the Germans...the Germans could only go...leave Germany with the permission of the military, which you can't...couldn't get at that moment after you had been called up to military service. And therefore we had to sneak and I with my new passport was sent across the frontier immediately to prepare that the Dutch people wouldn't reject a German. And the two went into the woods to cross the frontier and missed the way.</p><p>Came out on the German side again and only at midnight started again on the foot path to the woods to cross the frontier, and then they were caught by the border police, the German <span class="page-break" number="16"></span> 9 border police. And they looked round whether they saw any officer. And when they didn't see any officer, they showed our brothers the way to Holland. German border guard. And told him to where should they go in Holland to find a taxi to go to to meet me. You can say...[ mean God led the way all...all the time. (Laughing)</p><p> Q; What about you.

And they...and they...the police searched all the youths who tried to help the Jews for weapons. And those who had no weapons they let go. But those who had the revolver or a knife, they shot on the spot. And he had a revolver in his pocket.</p><p>Was shot on the spot. So I mean we had to...we had always contact with the Jews on the whole way. We tried to help and we tried, but...uh...it was... mean many Jews didn't believe that Hitler would act this way.

We had to give up Lichenstein and bring all the people over to England, 1938 when Hitler occupied Austria. So I had to bring them over. And I...I had to pay all of that in...in Lichenstein with a...uh...with...uh...my inheritance which I got in Switzerland. _.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. How did you live? What happened to you then?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And then I was working under for the power station for the Bruderhof for the community and then 1930...39, the war was declared. And then happened this...I heard Klaus say it this morning, they threatened to burn down the Bruderhof immediately.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Who threatened to burn down?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The population.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In England?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In England. Yeah. <span class="page-break" number="19"></span> 2</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You tell what you remember, because Klaus was really telling it secondhand.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell me what happened?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: A Quaker came to us on the way to Paris, where he was going to visit the...the " the King from . And he spent...uh...took a cup of tea and coffee in I think 7 village nearest to us. And there he heard that the people were going the same down to burn down the Bruderhof.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Why?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because we were Germans. Half of them Germans and half of them were the objectors of military service, defense of England. And there were Germans and we always lived together in peace. That was really suspicious to the English. And I experienced for instance before the war that the declaration, when I went to the village I was invited everywhere for a cup of tea.</p><p>From that moment on, the doors were closed because the people were fearful to give us hospitality. From that moment on! And we were accused of all I think every things. For instance, we were accused of...uh....disturbing the blackout and giving signals to the German bombers because you know we had the other blackout and sometime a child, pull...pulled...put away the curtain and then a light came out and then we were accused that we gave signals to the German bombers to how...how to fly. And secondly, an English girl married a German brother. In this time, and we were all classified since...since the war as...uh....neutral aliens and, of course, the English were...were not classified. And the moment he's married...the German, he was classified as an enemy alien and was put into internment camn richt there. -- Ryactlv the same. It was a real nsvchosis in the <span class="page-break" number="20"></span> 3 those children remained and came with us to Paraguay and she is now mother of a family.</p><p>She married not a Jew, but...uh...but we have no...no difficult with marrying Jews and that's because we don't see a difference there. And...uh...and then another boy, his parents suddenly turned up. They could escape from the Gestapo and went by Rome, France to Venezuela and they suddenly wrote to us and said look here. They would like to have their boy. How do you send a 6 year old boy in the wartime from England to Venezuela. And so we offered that we would accompany him in the hope that to accompany him that we have so much time in North America to prepare the immigration for us here. And I got all the papers from the Jewish committee in London for Al Fisher was his name...all the papers to accompany him.</p><p>And when we arrived in New York, the man...the immigration officer said, "Are you a Jew?" I said, "No, I am not a Jew." "How does it come that you accompany a Jewish boy?" Something suspicious there. And so he...he put us into a room on the ship, let us not the ship until the Jewish community New York integrate...investigated the whole thing. And the man came from the Jewish committee in New York, on the ship and looked all my papers through and he found everything in order. He said, "I can't accuse you of anything, but we take the boy from you and bring him ourselves to Venezuela." And they put him on Ellis Island and we visited him where was supplied very well and nicely. A 6 year old, 7 year old boy. And then he was accompanied by a Jewish nurse to Venezuela to where we got the news from his parents that he arrives safe. And we were 3 months free in North America to help try to put our immigrations. And there I think you know that story.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell us...tell us briefly what happened.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And then...then the thing was this. I was...we were two...two there, we were accompanied by Fisher. And thev were taken from us in - <span class="page-break" number="21"></span> 4 Committee. And that's again a story behind it. You know 1936...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No. Excuse me. We don't have time for the stories behind it unfortunately.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: At any case...at any case, through him we got the contact with the Quakers in Philadelphia and they brought us into contact with the State Department here in Washington. And with their international student home, I think, New Hampshire Avenue where they offered us to stay for $1 dollar a night, a breakfast. (Laughing) You know, from the Quakers. And then we tried first to set immicrations throuch our from _ the Assistant Attornev General of <span class="page-break" number="22"></span> 5 down the stairs and said, "My God, you don't say your husband. You say Mr. President." (Laughing) But she took it very, very, very good. Very good. But she said at the end, "Look here. I'm not the President myself. I have not the power to declare it, your immigration." And then we were told by confidence...confidential that they would have postponed our immigration until next year because that was the year of the third...third re-election campaign of Roosevelt. 1940! And they did...couldn't let in 300 pacifists at that moment.</p><p>This would disturb the re-election campaign of the democrats and therefore they would have to postpone it. The thing was the following. Our brothers in South Dakota gave an affidavit of sunnort which was not accented because that thev said it's a collective of and <span class="page-break" number="23"></span> 6 (Clearing throat) I had to find out how to get to Paraguay. And I went to the Pan American Union here to inquire and we found the Paraguay agent...we found the timetables and all the thing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Alright. I need to cut this short a little for the tape, because I think we could go on for a long time. You've been through a lot. How long did you live...how many years did you...did you live in Paraguay finally?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, we lived for 20 years in Paraguay. You had...you built up a whole community there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. Yeah. Three communities in Paraguay. One in Ascunion, and one in Uruguay. And then there came an inner weakening. You, as Klaus declared. Yeah. Uh...We compare the community with a lantern. And the lantern has a shell and a light. Yeah? If the light is not burning, what is the shell lantern? The lantern has only value with the light. Yeah? And we had a shell, but no more the light. That means the shalom, no more the unity. Unbrokenness.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>Shalom means unbrokenness. And we didn't have anything more of that. Therefore, the whole community went to pot, like the kibbutz today. Like the kibbutz. It's the same question of the kibbutz. And the question is the following. I put that thing to the kibbutz. I said...</p><p>wrote to them...we don't wish to tell them what they should do because they ask us, "Why are you able to live in community? What is the secret behind it?" Because we need it because the community with us falls fast. And so I answered them, "Look here. We don't...we can't tell you what you should do. We can only tell you what we experienced, and you may learn from that. And the question is that when the Christians tried to christianize the states, it was not so that they were able to Christianize the state, but the state corrupted them.</p><p>And you have to be careful that it doesn't happen with you the same way." And then...then...uh...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When did you...when did you come to this country finally. With all of this happening, when did you come to the United States?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You know..you know the thing was this. When this whole spiritual battles started, I needed to...to take a distance. And I was for 12 years in Buenos Aires, independent, to think about it. And then I went right back to the community in North America....uh...experiencing the following. You come together when each one of you takes the beam out of his own eye first before he tries to take the splinter out of the next. That's a fact. And this L..this is simply what I experienced. I can only say for here...uh...I found that the Bible is right. I do not say because the Bible says that, you should do that because the Bible says that, but I found out that the Bible is right. That's the whole point. That's just a fact.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Thank you. Okay. And on that note, I think we end. I cannot think of a better place to end the interview.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah. <span class="page-break" number="24"></span> 7</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Thank you.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's just a fact.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Thank you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: God is right. (Laughing)</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. That's it. Alright. Thank you very much. <span class="page-break" number="25"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
