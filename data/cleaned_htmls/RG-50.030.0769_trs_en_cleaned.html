<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No kidding? <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> Interview with Julian Kulski deg September 25, 2014</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: A great Polish hero. He was involved in both insurgencies against the Russians, and provided all of arms and support throughout the Jewish community of Poland to -- in support of the fight against the Russians, and the Russian anti-Semitism.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Isn't that interesting? So few people have such an unusual family connection, or blend.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So what uprisings would these have been?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You mean 1830.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: 18 thir -- 30, and the other one's in 1861.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see. And did your father know this rabbi? Did he ever see him, or --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, he knew his daughter, who was her -- his grandmother, and it's an interesting story. They were both born in Krakow, and she lived in the Kazimierz, which was the Jewish section. Her father was the rabbi of the oldest synagogue in Poland, in Krakow. And as young kids, they met, fell in love, and both families didn't want to have anything to do with them, because one was Catholic family, and the other one was a Jewish Orthodox. And so they had to leave Krakow and move to Warsaw.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, explain to me, it was your father's grandmother --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's right. <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> Interview with Julian Kulski deg September 25, 2014</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- who was -- who was --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Whom --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- the daughter of the rabbi?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's correct.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So it's a little bit like Tevya's family on "Fiddler on the Roof," where one of his young daughters, th-the last one, marries somebody who's not Jewish, but a Gentile.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, he was extremely objective, and she was well-educated, she was English speaking. But when she wanted to marry out of the Jewish faith, that was just too much for a chief rabbi.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So -- so, your father's grandfather, what kind of family did he come from? He was the Christian element in this, right?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right. His grand -- his grandfather, the husband of the daughter of Meisels, was a famous doctor, and he practiced in a town called Radom clo -- between Krakow and Warsaw.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So this was -- atha -- on both sides, educated people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Very much so. Very much so.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. And it also sounds -- I mean, one of the questions that I usually ask is, how much of a person's family history was told to them? And sometimes people <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> Interview with Julian Kulski " September 25, 2014</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> don't have much, because no one talked to them as a little child, but it sounds to me that your father told you very -- a lot about your family's --</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, he told me that after the war. He certainly didn't tell me during the war, when I was growing up, when I was 10 years old, 15 years old, because it was too dangerous to know that you had a Jewish ancestor. Because according to the German law, my father was considered Jewish. I wasn't, but -- the third generation, so that was kept a secret until after the war. My mother, of course, told me her story, there was no problem there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh. So, what was her story? Tell me a little bit about that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, her story was that she was born in a town called Mielitz, outside of Krakow, and she -- as a young girl she came to Warsaw, and went to a ball, and met this handsome, young officer of the Polish legions, who was my father. And they got married, and they stayed in Warsaw.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did she have siblings?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. She -- she was the oldest of four siblings, and her mother died when she was 11 years old, of TB, and she basically brought up the siblings, so she was very maternal.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Which means that even though she came from, let's say, an educated, elite family, she had some duties on her that are not usual for children growing up. <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> Interview with Julian Kulski deg September 25, 2014</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: They can be quite [indecipherable]</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- yes, was a big -- so she waited to have me for about 10 years after the marriage, because she enjoyed the freedom, and being able to travel with my father, to Moscow, to Paris where the -- where he worked. And -- but during the war, she had to work as a farmhand, in order to feed us during the war. So she was not beyond being able to do anything that was necessary in life. Hard work.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: We'll come -- we'll come to that, we'll come to that. Did you know her -- your aunts and uncles from her si --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, I did.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Most of them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, so what were their names, on your mother's side of the family?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, there was a --a young stepdaughter called Sofia(ph), and there was a -- another one, actual sister called Steffa(ph), and -- and a brother called Stefan.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay, those were from your mother's side of the family.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What about your father's side of the family? <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> Interview with Julian Kulski deg September 25, 2014</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My father had two siblings, a ya -- a sister three years younger, and a brother who was 10 years younger.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And what were their names?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Her name was Stanistawa, and his was Wladyslaw.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh, Wiadystaw. In your memoirs, which I read, you mention an Uncle Norbert. Who was Uncle Norbert, in the family scheme?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Uncle Norbert was my father's tutor during the Russian occupation of Warsaw.</p><p>The s -- y-you're not allowed to be taught in Polish, schools were taught in Russian.</p><p>So my -- the family hired this young lawyer. In exchange for living in the apartment, he was teaching the -- my father and his sister the Polish history, Polish mathematics and all kinds of languages. So he became the hero of my father, and when I was born, he became my godfather.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And he also married later, my aunt, my father's sister. So he was my uncle, and my godfather.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see. And when you talk about this Russian occupation, what years would we be talking about?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, this was up to 19 -- eight -- 1914.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see. <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> Interview with Julian Kulski " September 25, 2014</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: A hundred and twenty-five years of occupation by Russia.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. And it encompassed Warsaw?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Very much so.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Very much so.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. You -- so -- but some part of your family was in Krakew, which would have been part of the Austro-Hungarian empire in the 19" century.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, my de -- my mother came from Austro-Hungarian emp -- Mielitz, and Tarnow, who are where she was born and brought up, was part of the Austro- Hungarian empire.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: A question that is always -- I-I've always been curious about, was there a different sensibility amongst people who were brought up in one part of Poland, versus another, given the different rulers, and the different policies of those rules?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In--in--in some ways, yes. Administratively, militarily. | mean, the Poles had to fight in th-those armies, that were either Russian, German or Austrian. And they were -- th-they had different discipline, different ways of fighting. The same thing with a civil administration. So, when Poland became independent in 1918, it was quite a problem to start administering the country in one single way.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, because people had different -- <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> Interview with Julian Kulski " September 25, 2014</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Different backgrounds.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, different traditions. So what are some of the stories that your mother would tell you about her own family, given that she's descended from royalty?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, she didn't know much about the -- the -- her original background. Her stories were more about her parents, and her grandparents.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm. What did your grandparents, that is, her parents, how did they support the family, and the same question will be for your father's side: how did his parents support their family?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, my -- the parents were landowners, on my mother's side. On my father's side, they ha -- his father married a shoemaker's daughter in Warsaw, and they had a hard time, financially. And they -- the grandfather didn't help him, because although he married somebody who was not acceptable, society-wise, so did his oldest son Julian. And he didn't have anything to do with the grandchildren until my father was 18, when, for the first time, he met his grandparents.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh my. Oh my, what family dramas.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, yes, it was -- vit -- typ-typical Victorian rules and regulations.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. But I take it, because they were educated, they must have spoken more than one language. Is that so? <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> Interview with Julian Kulski deg September 25, 2014</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yes, well, my father spoke -- had to speak Russian, and my mother spoke German, and they lived in Paris, so they both spoke French. And later in life, they learned English.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mim-hm. Do you have any earliest memories from your own childhood?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, Ihave a memory of my father saving me from a very cruel German nurse. I was a very ena -- independent boy, and didn't always do what people wanted me to do, but what I wanted to do. And the -- the nurse was very cruel. She was ta -- take me under a bridge and put some hard stones and make me kneel on for -- for an hour when I was five years old. So that's my first memory. And one evening she told me sh-she would beat me in the middle of the night, wake me up. And my parents were going out to the opera, and I begged my mother not to go, and sure enough, an hour after they left, or half an hour, she started beating me. And fortunately, my father left the tickets to the ball behind, and entered while she was beating me, and she -- he threw her the -- out of the building. So he became a great hero of mine.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: A sad -- I mean, a very sad thing for -- to happen to a little boy, but a good way for a parent to appear, you know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, it prepared me for what was coming later on. When the Germans came, I wasn't surprised at their cruelty. <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Julian Kulski 8 September 25, 2014</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: That's so sad, I mean, it's -- yeah. What -- what kind of family life do you remember? And I mean this in many ways. If you could describe your living situation -- did you have an apartment, did you have a house? Where was it, and so on? From the earliest days, you --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, we lived in an apartment overlooking the Vistula river. It's a beautiful apartment on the fifth floor, overlooking the Vistula river. And then in 1935, they build a house, specially designed by an architect, a landscape architect, in the suburb of Zoliborz of Warsaw, and we moved there. So the -- most of my memories are from Zoliborz, which was a --a new suburb, mainly used by the government and military elite.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm. And was it north or west, or south of Warsaw?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was north of Warsaw, the most northern part of Warsaw.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Was it far -- was it -- did it take a long time to get into the center of the city from there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, the communication was pretty good. There were good streetcars, and I used to travel even as a young boy, all over Warsaw, on streetcars.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So would it take half an hour, or an hour, to get from your home by streetcar?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, about 20 minutes to downtown.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's not bad. <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: That's no -- that's not far at all. And what kind of a household was it in this house? How many people lived there, did your mother have help? Do a--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, my mother had three helpers; two women and one man. And besides us, there lived two aunts, my father's sister and also a cousin of my mother's, who was --who came over from Japan. She was a Polish consul in Tokyo, and brought in a load of Japanese things, music, and kimonos and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Must have been exotic.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- would entertain me as a young boy. So there's a -- and she had -- th-there were four separate apartments, little one room apartments where these aunts lived. They were really designed for my sister and for me when I grew up, so that we could live at home, but have a -- our own separate place.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How clever. I mean, how clever. But it meant that you had not only your mother and your father there, but an extended family.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, we had an extended family, and during the war, we had a lot of refugees.</p><p>Jewish families, Christian families, so that the house was really full during the war.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell me a little bit about these aunts. What did they -- you mentioned the one who was a consul in Japan.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah. <span class="page-break" number="11"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Julian Kulski 6 September 25, 2014</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: What were the other two aunts like?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, th-the -- th -- my -- my -- the other aunt was my father's sister, who was an intellectual and a historian, and -- and interested in poetry, and interested in architecture so that she -- she got me interested in architecture, an early stage.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm. And was there another aunt?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, there was another aunt during the war.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: There was a school not far from my house, I would be able to walk to it, and back.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you have any memories from school?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, except I didn't like it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Was it a public school, or --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was very much a public school, because my father felt that he was a-- very interested that I not be brought up in an elite environment, and was -- there were a <span class="page-break" number="12"></span> Interview with Julian Kulski a September 25, 2014</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> lot of poor boys, from poor backgrounds, who gave me a hard time. But that's exactly what my father wanted, to strengthen me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was your family religious?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, not -- well, yes and no. My mother's side was extremely religious, my father's side was not.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And do you think -- what would be the reason, you would think, that they were not?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, my father was against the -- what he felt the Catholic church was holding back, the social progress. And he was very interested in equality, and in everybody having the same rights. This was something that he fought for during the first World War, was for -- not only for Poland's independence, but also for -- give everybody the opportunity and equality. And he felt the church was in -- is -- in -- i-in -- like in France, where he studied, was holding them back. He was also very much against anti-Semitism, so that was one of the reasons he -- actually, he became em --a Mason, and he was very much interested in development of Poland, the social and economic and physical. And then when he became the mayor of Warsaw, of course, he was able to put these plans into execution.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And th-that really gave me a very difficult time when I was growing up, because I was -- I had to make that decision. For about four or five years, I really strove to try to find out, and I never did find.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell me a little bit about your father's career. How did he start out, how did he progress to the point that he held the positions that he did?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, my father was -- his mother, the shoemaker's daughter, was a socialist and an [indecipherable]. She was in the underground, against the Russians. So he was brought up in his home in very patriotic Polish background. They had secret press there, they had arms in the apartment when he was growing up. Then, he wasn't able to go to university in Poland, so he went to Belgium to study engineering. And then he interrupted his studies, because the first World War started, and he joined the Pilsudski's legions, and fought against Russia, and was very badly wounded on the Ukrainian front. He was shot through by the machine gun, through the stomach, and was in hospital for about six to eight months. And it affected his whole life, his whole nervous system. It's a -- the only reason he survived, because was very cold winter, it was January, and he froze on the -- on the front, in the -- but then he came, after the war, and then soon after was the Polish-Soviet war, which Poland won. It was the -- one of the two countries that ever beat the Soviet Union, Afghanistan and Poland. And he was back in the army, he was in the intelligence service, military intelligence, and he was very close to Marshall Pilsudski. <span class="page-break" number="15"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Julian Kulski deg September 25, 2014</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So let it -- let me interrupt. For many people, some of these events are not going to be familiar, so I'd like you to tell me the dates. When was this Polish-Soviet war, when did it take place? And tell us a little bit about who was mi -- Marshall Pilsudski.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The -- the Soviet-Polish war started 1920 - "21. It was an attack of Lenin, of trying to take over Europe, so that Poland's newly formed army, under the leadership of Marshall Jezef Pilsudski, who was the George Washington of Poland; together with some volunteers from America -- the Americans provided some pilots, who fought in the Kosciuszko foundation squadron during that war.</p><p>There were some Italians, and some French, and some English, who supported it, in order to defend Europe from the Soviets. And at first the Polish forces were winning, and then the Soviet forces got all the way to Warsaw, and it looked like that the -- Poland was going to lose, and they were going to enter the rest of Europe, but they -- wha-what is today called the miracle on the Vistula, Marshall Pilsudski, together with Marshall Foch, the French support came up with a very good military strategy, and beat the Soviets, and took hundreds of thousands of Soviet prisoners of war, and th-that was the end of the war, th-the -- the Soviets capitulated. And part of the agreement was that Poland could recoup all the arts, paintings, jewelry, and things which th-the Russians stole from Poland. And my <span class="page-break" number="16"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Julian Kulski " September 25, 2014 father was the head of the commission in Moscow, which together with my mother, who went through and brought all the antiques, and -- and -- and -- and things which they found in museums, which were Polish, back to Poland.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: What a fascinating --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: So they thu -- they had a interesting life during the early days, and then, after that, my father decided that he wanted to become a political scientist, and he went to -- to -- to-- to France. My mother worked, in order for him to study, and he went to Sorbonne, and he got his degree in political science. So when they got back to Poland, he was going to be in the -- Minister of Foreign Affairs, but instead, he ended up with the treasury department, and then in 1935, became vice-president of Warsaw.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Pll -- okay, I was thinking of asking this question later, but I'll ask it now: it is unusual for a city to have a president, or a vice-president, usually they have mayors.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>What is -- what was Warsaw's situation --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The difference between the mayors and the presidents is that large cities like Warsaw, Krakow, Poznan, Gdansk, have presidents. Smaller towns, smaller cities, have mayors.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see. <span class="page-break" number="17"></span> Interview with Julian Kulski September 25, 2014</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So that's the only difference, and it's basically the same functions, but a different title. And since Warsaw was the capitol of Poland, it was the most important city, therefore the president of Warsaw was second in line to the president of Poland.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And after the -- when -- when the war started, the Polish government left, and the president of the city was ste -- Stefan Starzynski, who fought against the russi -- Germans for a whole month, and he, in fact, became the head of the Polish state, and the Germans arrested him immediately after they conquered Warsaw, and shot him a month later, killed him. And -- and then my father became -- my father was an old friend of his still from childhood days, and they were together in the legions, they were together in the prison camp, they were together in Moscow, they were together in the treasury, and then in Polish cit -- in the Warsaw city hall. So that was then the natural that he followed, and was appointed president, during the wartime years, from 1939 to 1944.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That is an amazing -- an amazing story in and of itself, and when we are into the war years, I am going to want to know more about it, because, I mean, the questions that can come up for being in such a position, incredible. <span class="page-break" number="18"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Julian Kulski " September 25, 2014</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was a horrible position.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes, yes. But going back now to his -- to his career, he made then, a jump from the treasure ministry, into, let's say, the municipality.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. And what was his -- what were his responsibilities as vice-president?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: As vice-president -- as pres -- it was the whole transportation system, buses, streetcars, fu-future metro. Besides that, they electricity, all the industrial -- city industrial concerns. Labor. Th-the -- there were four vice-presidents, and he wa -- th- th-the -- this wa -- this was his responsibility.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. And did your mother finish university?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, my mother never went to the university. She was well-read, and very intelligent, but she never went to university, she married early.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Mim-hm. It's quite an accomplishment to help put your husband through college, you know --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes, yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- particularly if that's the Sorbonne.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: How did she do it? <span class="page-break" number="19"></span> ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion Interview with Julian Kulski 8 September 25, 2014</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, she -- she worked. She taught Polish to some Russians in fra -- Paris. She did everything she could in order to live on basically pennies. So, it was very difficult times for them, but they managed it. And she wrote her memoirs, and my father wrote his memoirs: my father's are published, my mother's are still unpublished.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And was this before you were born, all of this?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yes. This was all of when he wa -- she wa -- that's why she was waiting. She wanted to put him through university, to -- to give him the opportunity, and only after he became -- started to go up in the treasury department, they decided to have me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see. And tell me now a little bit about their personalities. What kind of a personality your father had, and your mother had.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My mother was very outgoing. She loved people, and everybody loved her. Her maternal instinct being bar -- having to bring up her sisters and brother when she was a teenager, taught her how to take care of it. Also, she had an example of her father, who was also very interested in -- in helping people. The towns that they lived were very large Jewish population, and her father was known for taking care, and helping the poverty stricken Jews. And so my mother was brought up in the spirit of looking after people, and taking care. And this was one of the problem that <span class="page-break" number="20"></span> ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion Interview with Julian Kulski " September 25, 2014 I had with her, because she was trying to take care of me too much, and I was too independent. So we're very much alike, I'm very much like my mother, but we had that problem. We loved each other, but I wanted to be independent, and -- and this lasted the whole li-lifetime. My father was completely different. My father was really quite shy, to start with. He had to overcome it to become a public figure, and he did very well in that. But he was an intellectual. He thought 10 times before he spoke, and he was very broadminded, liberal, and a-- a -- a very admired person in Warsaw, known and admired. Sometimes my mother would get on his nerves because she would say something just without thinking, and that would get him -- get him into apoplexy.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But it sounds like they were both -- I mean, it sounds -- they were very strong people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They were both very strong people. Ver -- extremely strong people, i-i-in -- in different ways, quite opposite, but very much in love.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Also very nice.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: So the -- I --I was sumb -- I met a cousin of mine in -- in -- in Poland just months ago, and they comparing our bring -- how we're brought up. They were rich, and -- but didn't have love. And we had lots of love, but we were not so rich. <span class="page-break" number="21"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Julian Kulski 8 September 25, 2014</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah, well that's -- all of these things are crucial for a child, of course, in their development. And in many ways it helped, or -- when you had a strong upbringing, when you're put into times of stress, sometimes you have some reserves to draw upon --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Exactly.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- you know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And I think that's what pulled me through the war.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really. Yeah. So tell me a little bit about -- you were born in 1929, yes?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So Hitler comes to power when you're just four years old.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did -- from the time that you could remember, did your parents talk about history and politics and current events at home?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yes, my father and my -- and Uncle Norbert used to talk politics, but the closest I got was when I was eight years old, I spent summer in Bydgoszcz, which is on the -- a city on the German border. And my so-called uncle, he was one of my father's wartime buddies, was the governor of the province, and I was lucky to be -- spend two summers in the governor's palace.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Wow. <span class="page-break" number="22"></span> Interview with Julian Kulski *deg September 25, 2014</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And they had also summer place, it was surrounded by Polish armored troops, and I used to -- was allowed to ride in Polish tanks, at eight years old, that was like, great fun.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- and I -- I --I learned how to have great social life, to a point that when I got home, I told my mother that she didn't behave like a president's wife should, sh -- the way Aunt Hella as the governor's wife -- because they had balls every week, and lots of food and lots of dancing. And furthermore, I told her -- told that my father should be a right-winger, not a left-winger, and my mother told him that, and he burst laughing, that this eight year old was trying to tell him how to -- what kind of politics he should have. But I was just interested in all the nice things.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: All the wonderful cookies, and -- and chocolates, and one day I even ordered eight guys with -- f-for a ball which didn't exist, and my uncle caught me and chased me around the palace.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How cute. How cute.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So, I--I was full of beans. <span class="page-break" number="23"></span> Interview with Julian Kulski " September 25, 2014</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. It also sounds that the sense of -- of what it is to be Polish was very strong in your family.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, it -- it -- it was not -- it was only one family. I think that in school, the teachers, the family and everybody, was so excited to have a free and independent Poland, free for everybody. The Christians, the Jews were having, you know, particularly the Jews had wonderful theaters, and -- and -- and social life, and at -- in my life, th-there was -- I didn't run into any anti-Semitism, because well, the --- my father's closest friends were Jewish members of the prepe -- legion police, legion, who fought the [indecipherable] so the -- I wa -- religion was not an important part in my bri -- upbringing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, it also -- I mean, from what you were saying is that many people will -- will say in their testimonies, they -- as they're talking about their lives, either that there was anti-Semitism that they experienced as Holocaust survivors, or as Jews growing up in Poland, or as Poles who had very little contact with -- with the Jewish community. That's different for you, and for your family.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, it-it-it-it was different in the country, and different in the city. In the city, I mean, one-third of Warsaw were Jewish, and so th -- and there were a lot of Orthodox, and I used to enjoy, as a boy, going in there and seeing the -- the food, th- the laughter, the language, the -- to me it was very -- very fascinating, although I <span class="page-break" number="24"></span> Interview with Julian Kulski 8 September 25, 2014</p><p> didn't know I had any Jewish background, it was just very interesting. But th-the place where I lived was all Poles of Jewish background, who were the leaders of Poland, intel -- university professors, army men. Ten percent of Polish officer corps were Jewish. So that I didn't pay any attention t-to the -- to that. That's why I didn't run into it, but I-- I heard stories that in the country, that it was different, that the Or-Orthodox Jews lived separately from the Catholic peasants, and sometimes there were problems, but it was never s-something that I saw in the city.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. It wasn't part of your life.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, it wasn't part of my life.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Tell me about your childhood friends. Did you have any close friends as you were growing up?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, the -- the -- the -- the closest friend was -- that I had, was in Kazimierz on the Vistula in 1939, at the beginning of the war; a girl by the name of Zula(ph), who was also of Jewish background, but was Catholic, and we became good friends. And then we continued in -- in -- in-- in Warsaw, when I got back from the vacation.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: A-And since Poland was the main exporter of grain, Kazimierz had the places for storing grain, and the Vistula was the main avenue of going to the Baltic. And -- but it was a su-summer place, and it's still a big vacation place. I was there a month ago with my wife. And we s -- we -- we had -- my parents rented a house there, and although my father expected war, he didn't realize how soon it would happen, and just as soon as he got -- got us settled in Kazimierz, the car came from Warsaw from President Starzynski, taking him back, because the war started.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, he expected to stay a fi -- at least a week or 10 days, that was his vacation, but he was called off to Warsaw, because the -- he was the not only vice-president, but he was the head of the anti-aircraft civilian defense, and he had tens of thousands of people trained already for putting out fires. In each building there was somebody who had -- they had sand and water on the roof, so when the Germans started dropping incendiary bombs, well, they were trying to put out the fires as soon as possible.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I will never forget September fir -- "39, because I was -- it was the first time in my life that I was really terrified. Zula(ph) and I went out mushroom hunting, and was early in the morning, and about 10 o'clock, somewhere around 10 o'clock in the morning, there was a terrible noise, and the trees started bending, and right over the treetops came out huge black airplanes with crosses on it. And we didn't know what it was. We didn't wa -- know that the war started, but they were flying to bomb Warsaw, so they had bombs underneath it. And so we just lay down until they -- they were -- there seemed like hundreds of them. There weren't that many, I'm sure, but it appeared to me, to a little boy, and we were terrified. And then, after they left, the trees straightened out, and there was this wonderful silence after the noise. And then we loo -- I looked up at the sky, and there was a eagle circling around. And the eagle is the symbol of Poland. This was a white and black eagle [indecipherable].</p><p>And it was something which was so unusual, I -- I-- I was -- the whole experience, first of that noise -- we run home, and we found out -- my mother told us that the war started, and she started worrying about my father, and what was happening in Warsaw, because w-we knew that he had such an dangerous post.</p></p></dialogue>

Not -- an-and both of the enemies were much stronger. But there were a lot of soldiers coming through Kazimierz, and the la -- lot of talking about what we should do. I know that my mother at one time got all the -- my mother and -- and some other women with children got onto a horse drawn vehicle and went out to -- to running off towards Krakow, but th-then we turned around, came back the next day.

They came in, I would say in the second week of the war, towards the third week, and I was on the square they came. It wasn't a market day. But they came on motorcycles, and th -- i-in cars. And it was a very hot summer, and dry summer, so they were all covered with dust. And so my first thought was, they didn't look like victors, they looked like a--a losing army. But they were the victors. And then they brought in the orchestra, Wehrmacht orchestra, and they started playing in the square, in this medieval square, military marches. And they brought in the Orthodox rabbi, and tied him up to the roof of the wooden synagogue, and started a fire, and made the elders run in to try to save him, and they all died right in front of my eyes.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, after Warsaw capitulated, towards the end of September. My father came in the limousine, city limousine to pick us up. He was -- had problem walking. The --had problems with his legs because he did so much running around the city during the siege of Warsaw. He looked tired, and sick. And they took us to Warsaw, and I remember entering the city, and seeing dead people on the sides, a-and dead horses and ruined buildings, and my mother burst crying, and got so sick that he had to stop the car, because she threw up when she saw everything that was happening. I mean, my father knew that -- was used to it, after a month. But for us, coming from this idyllic place, it was just a-- such a shock. When we got to our house, the house didn't have any windows left, you know, because of the bombs. And there was --</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, it was full of glass, you know, a-and -- and dirt, and it was the same house, but it wasn't. Fortunately, before the winter, we were able to get the glass back in the windows, because it was a very hard winter, a very cold winter, and there was a shortage of fuel. It was very difficult, and the Germans started the terror immediately. They arrested my father's boss, the president. They arrested my father. They came to our house, and I was 10 and a half years old. I was playing on the floor with my balsa ships. And I had German ships, and I had Polish ships. And I remember these three Gestapo men coming in and searching the house, and one of them stopped by and spoke in broken Polish, and asked who was winning this war?</p><p>And I said, of course, Poland is winning the war. But it's interesting that this guy, today, is 96 years old, and he is the one who admitted that the Germans killed President Starzynski a few weeks later, in Warsaw. My father -- everybody thought at -- til now that he was -- died in a concentration camp. But he says that -- and th-this was examined by the Polish courts, and they pretty much decided that's a true story. And I agree with it.

And just now, two years ago, he notified the Polish government that he wanted to tell the story of what happened. And he also ta-talks about my father appearing for interview by the Gestapo headquarters. They were called in.

And there were all kinds of stories, that he was in Dachau, that he was killed during the Warsaw uprising, that he was ki -- li-like the head of the Polish underground army, the General Groetravetski, and evidently it wasn't true. He was killed right then in Warsaw.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And tell me then, how do you make the connection that it's exactly this person who stopped in your house --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Beca-Because he reme -- because in his statements to the Polish government -- and it's -- it's lengthy, it's about 25 pages, he mentions coming and -- and -- and interview to our house, few days after the city was taken over, and my sister and I were the witnesses.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, he was given an order by Starzynski to continue taking care of the city, and of the people. He was elected by the underground Polish government. The Polish government was in London, but Polish underground -- underground was in Warsaw, and th-they made my father the successor to Starzynski. But the Germans, who needed to have the city operating well, and they didn't have the manpower, because most of them were on -- in the army. And they needed the city to be running properly. So they -- th-they made my father the mayor. <span class="page-break" number="41"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Julian Kulski * September 25, 2014 Biirgermeister was his title. So he was the president of -- on the -- from the Polish government's side in London, and the underground government, but as far as the Germans were concerned, he was the Biirgermeister. So some of the pole -- citizens, of course, who had -- who were not invol -- who didn't know about the underground, thought that my father was a collaborator. And that the whole city hall was a collaborator. Then there were tens of thousands of individuals -- it's a huge city, million and a half -- in order to operate, that was a very big bureaucracy. And in order to run properly; the electricity, the transportation, the b -- the schools, the whole system. So th -- and the fortunate thing for my father, and I think this is why he was able to survive, although he was arrested three, four times by the Gestapo, because they have -- they suspected that he was a member of the underground, and that he was anti-German. But they -- there was one individual, called Ludwig Leist, who was with Hitler in the first World War, in the Bavarian regiment. He was a regular soldier like Hitler. But they got to know each other, and in -- who in 1934 or deg35, joined the Nazi party and joined the Brownshirts. And sp -- went up very quickly, although he didn't have any -- much education, if any, became a general in the essda -- Sturmabteilung, SA. And he was trained to be the supervisor of Warsaw.

He gave him a Mercedes and a driver. And he let him travel all over Warsaw, and treated him like a human being.

From there on they -- they closed up the ghetto, and neither Leist nor my father could do. But f-for the -- the first year, the city hall was able to take care of everybody in-- in Warsaw, inside and outside of the wall.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So that meant that your father di-- reported directly to Leist.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My father reported directly to Leist, but my father reported directly to the prime minister of Poland. So he had a -- this horrible jewel -- job -- pole -- publicly, he was reporting to a German, but on a daily basis, he was surrounded by three military -- Polish underground military intelligence agents, and was in c -- daily contact with the civilian and military underground facilities. So if he was able to gather intelligence, and pass it on, being an -- himself an intelligence officer from the Soviet war, he knew how to do it, and he was able to maneuver it, and fortunately, a-as -- as I said, Leist was the one who saved many lives, including my father's and my own. He got me out of the -- from the train in Auschwitz. He got my father out of the Gestapo three times.</p></p></dialogue>

After the war, he, together with other Nazis, were before the Polish courts, denazification courts, and the surviving members of the ghetto, and of my father's administration defended Leist, and the other Nazis were hanged, but Leist was declared a Nazi, but not a criminal, and he got a few years sentence, which he spent in Polish jail after the war, for belonging to a criminal organization, the Nazi party. He wrote his memoirs, and my father wrote his memoirs, and Czesrniakew wrote his memoirs. So I've got all of these, and I've translated them into English.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Amazing. So, it sounds that -- from your telling, that he was li -- not brutal, in a very brutal position. Is that --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He was an end -- it wa -- he was referred to by the leaders of Warsaw as the prisoner of the city hall. Because he was a -- he was a martyr, because he -- he had to save as many lives as possible, and provide as decent living conditions for -- while -- Czerniakew would come almost every week, to see my father. He was allowed to leave the ghetto and report to my father, and to Leist. And my father, at first, was very suspicious of Leist, because he was a Nazi, and all Nazis were horrible, inhuman, and yet, this guy went -- after Czerniakoew left, and was described the conditions in the ghetto, he turned to my father, he said, poor people -- about the Jew -- Polish Jews in the ghetto. And my father was taken aback. And there were a <span class="page-break" number="45"></span> ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion Interview with Julian Kulski * September 25, 2014 number of things that he did during the five years. He knew about the underground army, he knew about the underground state, and he did not report it to the pole -- to the German authorities. And the German authorities were suspicious of him. In 1943 -- for -- no, deg44, after the attempt on Hitler's life, Fisher, who was Leist's supervisor, was told to form a list of a hundred Nazis who was not loyal to Hitler.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>And he called Leist and told him -- gave him the job to do it in Warsaw, to find hundred Germans -- and there were tens of thousands of Germans living in Warsaw at the time, military and civilian, to form that list. And Leist said, well, I'm sorry, but I don't know anybody who is disloyal. And Fisher said, why don't you start with your own name? So -- and during the trial, after the war, Fisher tried to pretend, to save his life, that he was -- allowed Leist to be the good guy. Like -- which was not -- which was a lie.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Amazing. Amazing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: So that was --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I mean, but I also think -- I mean, then Leist, your father, and all those people were living on a razor's edge.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They were -- well, Leist wa-was too. He was more afraid -- Leist was more afraid of Gestapo than he was afraid of us, the underground army. And -- and -- and --and one -- he used to go hunting outside of Warsaw with Fisher. And in 1943, the <span class="page-break" number="46"></span> Interview with Julian Kulski * September 25, 2014</p><p> Polish underground courts passed a sentence on Fisher for the -- death, for the murder of the ghetto population, and the Polish population outside of the wall. And I was in the -- at that time, in the unit, the commander unit, which executed the sentences of the Supreme Court, of the underground courts, on Nazi criminals. And the sentence was passed upon Ludwig Fisher. Well, they were coming back and wi -- we put up machine guns along the road, and as the Mercedes were passing, we shot Fisher's car. And unfortunately, these two guys changed cars, and Leist was the -- in the Fisher's car, and Leist just hit the floor, and when the car arrived in the city hall, he called my father downstairs and he said, look how I've been -- for -- for all the good things which I have done for the pole -- Warsaw population, and they are trying to kill me. Why don't you get in touch with the underground and tell them that I am a Polish friend, a friend of Poles. He said -- my father said, of course, I will do it tomorrow -- right away, if I knew how to do it. [--I have no contact with the underground. But of course, he did contact the liaison officers, and they notified my father next day, to tell him that the order was on Fisher, and not for him, and for -- never change the cars again.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Dur -- yeah, at the time, when your father was in this extremely precarious position, did he ever talk at home about what was going on in the office?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no, no. No, he -- he -- as a matter of fact, that's one of the reasons why he gave me away. I didn't live with -- with -- with my father and my parents during the war.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: As I was reading your -- your -- your memoirs, or your -- sort of like your -- your diary that you wrote afterwards.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I found it very odd that at such a young age, you would not live at home. Tell me what happened. How did things progress?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, I was -- right after the war, the Germans closed the schools. I had a lot of free time, and from the time I was 10 to 12, I and a friend of mine went out, and we would pick up the bombs which -- small bombs which fell on the streets of Warsaw, that didn't explode. We'd take them to the garage of my friend, and we would take out the powder out of it. And so my father was worried that -- <span class="page-break" number="48"></span> ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion Interview with Julian Kulski ~ September 25, 2014</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: He knew this?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- I was going to get killed.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And my father was being arrested at home by the Gestapo. So he was worried that during the searches of the home, I would get him into trouble, or he would get me into trouble. So he got in touch with my pre-war scoutmaster, by the name of Ludwig Burger(ph). He was also of Jewish background. I think he was a Protestant, but he was Ludwig Burger(ph). And I lived with him. And I wanted to join the underground army when I was 12, so Ludwig came to my father for permission, because I was only 12 years old, and my father said, of course, y-you c -- you can -- you can join the army, so I was sworn into the Polish army at the age of 12.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Unbelievable.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And I lived with Ludwig, which was only about three blocks away, so from to time I would drop in on the house, but basically I was -- there was no school, and Ludwig trained me as a soldier, and I was -- Ludwig formed the first unit of the Polish underground army out of the boy scouts in Zoliborz. Most of them were older than I, I was the youngest one. And at first I was just the runner, I was running around with secret contacts, to the ghetto and t-to other places in Warsaw. But later <span class="page-break" number="49"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Julian Kulski " September 25, 2014 on I became a f--at the age of 13, a year later, I became a regular soldier, and I was trained in arms, and we had maneuvers outside of the city, and were trained as a regul -- in order to prepare us for to -- to fight.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, did you fa -- was your father -- did you tell him before you went away, that you and your friend were collecting these unexploded bombs?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, he knew -- he heard about it, because my f-- my friend lost his leg. I wasn't there, but he was supposed to wait for me, but he got some nit -- nitrogly-glycerin, and it exploded and the whole garage went up, and he lost a whole leg. So my father knew that I was -- they were also trying out making bombs, and -- and -- and trying them out in the parks, and so we -- he was a-afraid that I was going to get killed, and he had no time for the family. He was -- he worked day and night at the city hall.</p><p>Just drop in for food once in a while. And so he didn't have -- th-there was no man to take care of the little boy. And he felt that Ludwig Burger(ph) would be an excellent person to take hold of me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And did your mother have anything to say about it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My mother didn't know anything about it. My mother was very upset after the war, when the book came out, that he didn't -- she didn't know anything about it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: She didn't know anything about the powder, or the -- or the -- <span class="page-break" number="50"></span> ontactrefiranneGaushariarg a hither atrmedortabeattfiexaliaton Interview with Julian Kulski ~ September 25, 2014</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No. Well, I don't know if sh -- I don't think she knew anything -- she knew very much. She certainly didn't know that Ludwig Burger would sign me up as a soldier in the underground army.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But she knew he took you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yes, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: But he was a boy scout master, and also, together with Ludwig, there were two young women, Steffan(ph) Solla(ph), and Alexandra(ph) Solla(ph) -- Solkul(ph), who were the daughters of a doctor who take care of my mother's father when he was sick --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh wow.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- in Tarnow. Dr. Solkul(ph). So she knew them, and she kn -- everybody knew Ludwig Burger from before the war, because he was an actor, he was a very active youth leader in the -- in the boy scout movement. And wer --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And you said -- and you said he was Jewish?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He was of Jewish background, and so were the -- the two girls, ot -- all -- all three of them were of Jewish background.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And how is it that they wouldn't have been in the ghetto? <span class="page-break" number="51"></span> ontactrefiranneGaushariarg a hither atrmedortabeattfiexaliaton Interview with Julian Kulski 8 September 25, 2014</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, because they were -- they were hiding. They were hiding, so my father really handed me over to a Jewish family, basically. Only, as I said, the religion had no part in it. They were extremely patriotic, integrated Polish intellectuals, and th- they -- they -- they lived -- there was a little boy, Marek(ph), who is still alive, the son of Ludwig's, I saw him a month ago.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh my.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And we keep in touch. And when I was being arrested by the Gestapo, he was playing over the secret place where we had our -- our arms. And he was only eight years old at time. I was 13.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But here is my question. It's -- it's not so much that they were integrated, and not -- religion didn't play a part, it is, wouldn't they have been known by the Gestapo, and why -- how is it that they could hide in plain sight in -- in W-Warsaw.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, it all -- it -- well, in almost every house in Zoliborz that I know of, I mean, certainly every other house, had a Jewish family being hidden, including our own house. My mother hid about nine members of the Jewish family between our house, and we -- also, later on we had a house in the country. And she took care of -- saved a number of members of -- Jews who were, you know, integrated, and were not Polish speaking, and who could survive in -- in -- in hiding.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see. And it's a kind of crass way to put it, but did Ludwig look Jewish? <span class="page-break" number="52"></span> Interview with Julian Kulski "6 September 25, 2014</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, very much so. Just look at the picture.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. So that meant that if he was walking down the street, he could have been picked up.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, he was six feet four inches tall, he was extremely handsome, and he was very self-confident. He was a real leader, and bordering on the arrogant, you know.</p><p>So I don't think they -- they would dared him, until they found out that they were looking for him. And this is how I got caught, and -- and -- and Steffa(ph) were arrested.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: We'll come to that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But -- because I want to do this a little bit more chronologically --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They were looking for us. They were looking for Ludwig.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. But it's -- it's just so surprising to me, to hear of somebody who would be living openly, more or less, on the Aryan side, and he could -- considered himself a Protestant, but that doesn't matter if the Germans are in control.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Exactly. But th-th -- he was a great hero in this part of Warsaw. He was known by everybody and loved by everybody, and nobody cared what he was -- he had the Jewish grandfather, or -- or the grandmother, or whatever it was, you know, it was unimportant.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did he have false papers? Did he have false papers? Did he have real papers that said I am --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh, I am sure -- I am sure he had false papers. They di -- all had false papers. All three of them had false papers, in case of being ta -- caught. But Burger(ph) could be a Jewish -- a German name, as well as Jewish.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Of course.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So, you know, it -- I don't know what kind of papers. Maybe he had the Volksdeutsche papers, for all I know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I--I me -- he -- the -- that was height of conspiracy, and nobody was supposed to know anything what the other person was doing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But I know that when I moved there, there was a little boy, kind of a poor boy that lived in the -- in that apartment, and Ludwig gave me a job to try to test him whether he was not going to report Ludwig to the police, whether it was for his activities in the underground, or for being of Jewish background, I couldn't -- I <span class="page-break" number="54"></span> Interview with Julian Kulski * September 25, 2014</p><p> didn't know at the time. But the point was that I was able to convince him to do that, and Ludwig had him shot, as I -- they di--</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So what was the test?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- he was -- he was head of the c -- the -- the company of 150 soldiers, and at that time the captain had the right of making a decision like that, legally, of a--a suspect was enough to be killed, because he could bring so many deaths, if he was caught by the Germans.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So tell me, what was the test that you had -- that you had for him?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I talked him into going to the police and -- and -- and -- and selling Ludwig for money. And it wasn't very difficult, he already had that idea, so I went and reported to Ludwig, and Ludwig had him shot.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Wow.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But you know, again, that was something that was -- I was 12 years old at the time, and I-- I--I---TI only found out later that he was killed, and where he was killed, by -- by our execution squad. And I felt, of course, responsible for it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, you maybe have to repeat it a little bit, but tell me what your life was like with Ludwig, in this new place. You had the two Solkul(ph) sisters, you had Marek(ph). He was Ludwig's son?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And there was a mother -- grandmother living. And -- <span class="page-break" number="55"></span> Interview with Julian Kulski *deg September 25, 2014</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Where was Marek's(ph) mother?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And she -- she got him after the war, after Ludwig was killed, but at that time, he was live -- for whatever reason, he was living with the father, and Alexandra(ph) Sokol(ph) was the head of the international couriers section, women's courier, and they were also responsible for -- also attacks on German criminals. S-Steffa(ph), who was the love of Ludwig's, and she was kind of his secretary, and did all of the secretarial work for him, and did the h-home caring -- help -- cooking, and taking care of the house.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, I was -- I'd---I'd --I-I-I was the -- I had joined them at the age of 11, and in the same year, later that year, when I was 12, when I was sworn into the underground army, 1941. <span class="page-break" number="56"></span> ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion Interview with Julian Kulski "" September 25, 2014</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Which means you don't really have a childhood. Your childhood ended then.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, it did. Well, everybody had to grow up, but -- but basically we were brought up, the Germans made it very clear, that it was question of time, that they were going to kill us all. So it wasn't a question of whether we're gonna live or die, only when. And that made a whole mental attitude different. This is why we rose up in 1944, that's how all our brothers in -- in the Warsaw ghetto rose in 1943, because they preferred -- we preferred to die with our arms in hands, than going to the gas chambers. And it was a question of age. Both inside the ghetto, and outside of the ghetto, the adults, the priests, the rabbis, would tell the kids not to stir things up, not to form in a resistance, not to resist, because that would make things worse. Well, we knew better. We knew that we had to defend ourselves, we had to defend our families. And -- and it fon -- it proved that the young people were right, and when I meet now with American kids in high schools, I often am on their side, because when you are young, you are honest, you have -- you are not spoiled, you -- you've got certain inborn morals, and -- and you know better than the parents, who are more scared.</p></p></dialogue>

When I -- when I hear about the -- the -- the education system being bad, there are always bad students and good students, but the good students are fantastic.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Great kids.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Amazing. Tell me -- let's go back to how things -- what were some of the other activities you took part with under Ludwig's, I suppose guidance, or -- or direction, and so on?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, first of all, he trained me t-to prepare me for arrest by the Gestapo --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And how do you do that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: --and my torture. Sorry?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How do you do that? How do you get trained for that? <span class="page-break" number="59"></span> Interview with Julian Kulski * September 25, 2014</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, he did two things. He taught me how to fight when you don't have a gun.</p><p>Fight with your teeth, how do kill a person with a knife, or with your hands, and with your teeth. That's how he died. He also prepared me how I should answer under torture, about him, because he knew perfectly well that I would be the natural one that the Gestapo would want to find him, through me. So he said, just say to the Gestapo that you hated me. That I was a tyrant. I wouldn't let you have sex with girls. I wouldn't let you have the freedom that you wanted to do, that you really hated me, and that you will collaborate with them in trying to find me. And also, don't admit that you know any German, so you'll have a translator. So he prepare me very well for it, and it was very useful when I was taken to the torture chambers.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But during -- while I lived with Ludwig, I was -- at first I was carrying secret messages, and at one time he took me to the ghetto, which was an experience. I -- I used to go to visit my girlfriend in the ghetto, but this was when the streetcar would still be allowed to go. The -- it wasn't allowed to stop inside the ghetto, but it went from one gate to the other, and I would jump off, see Zula(ph), and then jump back on the -- on this -- on the streetcar, which was under the police guard.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was this when the ghetto was still part of -- under Leist's control, rather than the SS?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no, no, no, no. No, Leist only had it a few months, it was still in the construction stages.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was the -- the planning stages, rather than the -- even construction.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So, Zula(ph) and -- [break]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay, this is a continuation of our interview with Mr. Julian Kulski. We were talking about you visiting Zula(ph) in the ghetto. So that ax -- answers another question that I had, which was, what happened to Zula(ph). She was then forced, with her mother, to enter the ghetto.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: After the 1943 Warsaw uprising, I believe she was in the bunker with Annie Levitch(ph) and they committed suicide in the last days of the uprising. But I have no proof of it, it's just my conjecture, knowing her and her spirit, that she was in the underground, inside the wall, the way I was in the underground outside the wall.</p><p>But in 1942, Ludwig took me for a two day visit into the ghetto, and he told me that he was taking me so that if he got killed there, I would be able to take out the information from inside the ghetto. And I was wondering at the time, if he was killed, why wouldn't I be killed, but I didn't say anything. Took the order. So we went in, and we went through a secret underground passage through one of the buildings, and we met some Polish Jewish underground members, who brought us some dirty clothes, because we would be recognized right away in our outfits from <span class="page-break" number="62"></span> ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion Interview with Julian Kulski "6 September 25, 2014 the outside, so we put the rags on.

There were dead people on the sidewalks, children.</p><p>And then I saw a German hunting, shooting innocent people on the street, a pregnant woman being kicked. It was just unbelievable. We had to hi -- when he was shooting, we had to hide in a doorway of a -- of an apartment building. And then we got there, and Ludwig was asked to transmit through the underground government to London, the information what was happening to Warsaw Jews.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: What wa -- okay, what kind of information --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- and what kind of requests were made?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- well, by that time, it was already tr-trainloads being taken to the gas chambers, and everybody knew what -- my father told Czerniakew what was happening, and Czerniakew committed suicide. But it -- the -- the wa -- the west didn't do anything to help, and it was -- there were desperate attempts. They asked to -- the west to inform Germans that for every Polish Jewish life, there would be a German killed.</p><p>Prisoners of war, and other German citizens. And they realized that it was an unrealistic request, but it was a desperate move to -- to -- to help. They asked to have <span class="page-break" number="63"></span> Interview with Julian Kulski *" September 25, 2014</p><p> the trains bombed on the way to Majdanek, to Auschwitz. And also, they asked us for arm -- for information how to build bunkers, for concrete, and reinforced steel, so they could prepare for the uprising, and for arms. I know that my own company submitted 50 -- sold, or gave 50 guns to the Jewish fighters. And then, later on, I was in the Warsaw fire brigade, and the Germans respected the Polish firemen, because they needed it, during the allied bombing of Warsaw, the Polish firemen were very important, and the Polish blu -- blue police, some of them were [indecipherable], some of them were members of the underground. So they couldn't -- you couldn't depend on the -- but the -- the -- the -- the firemen were under -- according to German law, the police and the fire departments went under the police, under the Gestapo, under the SS. So the -- the guy who destroyed the ghetto and murdered innocent -- destroyed the whole ghetto and the people inside, was Stroop, Jiirgen Stroop. And he was responsible for the Polish fire department.</p><p>And once a year there would be a parade of all the f-fire trucks, and firemen on it in the, you know, firefighting uniforms, before him. And he was very proud of the Polish firemen. He didn't know that 80 percent of us were members of the underground army. <span class="page-break" number="64"></span> Interview with Julian Kulski " September 25, 2014</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, when you were in the ghetto, there was the request of a life for a life -- when you were in the ghetto, there was this request of a life for a life, because so many Jews were being killed indiscriminately.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right, right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: There was a request for information on how to build bunkers.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And when we run into German patrols, Wehrmacht patrols, they would salute us, we would salute them. So they thought -- it was a very good cover for the -- for -- for us to carry arms and -- and -- and attack Germans.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was this the only time, after the ghetto was sealed off, that you were in the ghetto, or did you go in to deliver those 50 pistols?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no, I had nothing to do with that.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay, and so I want to go back to this again. When I asked earlier, not what happened to her at the end, but how is it that she had to go to the ghetto when she was half and half --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, because they were considered -- everybody was considered Jewish up to the third generation. If you had one grandfather who was Jewish, you were Jewish <span class="page-break" number="66"></span> Interview with Julian Kulski " September 25, 2014</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> as far as the Germans were concerned. That's how I was saying, that if the Germans knew that my father's grandmother was Jewish, he would have been considered Jew by the Nazis.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see. And so, for Zula(ph), and her mother, of course, who was Jewish, it's a -- it's a given.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right, right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But for -- and this is where the juxtaposition for me sounded so confusing; that she is forced, but Ludwig isn't.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you see what I'm saying? She cannot have a choice of living outside -- this is someone who doesn't know the war, who doesn't know the situation. And why I was ask --</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What did wa -- how did things proceed for you, after you left? What kind of activities were you involved in?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I was invol -- continued training, military training, maneuvers outside of the city, learning about new arms, explosives. But soon after, in 1943, in the middle of the summer, there was a wedding of two Polish underground officers, in one of the downtown churches. And there were about a hundred underground officers attending it, which is against all the rules of conspiracy, which they broke. And somehow the Germans learned about it, and at the height of the marriage ceremony, the SS entered the church, and arrested 89 people, and among them was Ola(ph) Solkul(ph), with whom I lived, with Steffa(ph), and Ludwig. And she had false papers, German papers under Evee(ph) Keller(ph), and guns. So, as soon as we found out that she was arrested, Ludwig left the apartment and he told -- send me home to my parents, so only Steffa(ph) and Marek(ph), and the grandmother were left. But about 10 days, two weeks later, we found out through our underground sources that Ola(ph) was tortured so badly that she committed suicide, and was -- died, rather than tell the stories. So I felt I was safe, and in the morning I went back <span class="page-break" number="69"></span> Interview with Julian Kulski " September 25, 2014</p><p> to the apartment. Ludwig stayed away, fortunately. Well, in the afternoon, I was in the living room, and I heard banging on the front door, and Steffa(ph) said, who is it? And I heard, Gestapo, open the door, or I will shoot through. And I was on the first floor, and there was a balcony, and I was going to jump into the park, a public park, and escape. So I opened the doors, the French doors, and I look behind me, and the Gestapo man already had a machine gun pointed at me, and said [indecipherable]. So I had to surrender. He -- I was arrested on the spot. They -- th- they check on the apartment. The little boy was playing over the secret safe where the arms were kept. And so they took me and Steffa(ph), and took me downstairs, and there were open, big Mercedes cars, three of them, and they put -- put us in, and took us to the Pawiak prison.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What's the Pawiak prison?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Pawiak prison was an old so -- Russian prison in the center of Warsaw, a huge -- built to take care of Polish par -- freedom fighters of the 19 century. The -- the -- this was a huge, huge -- so huge prison. And th -- there were double gate, and the cars went through the first gate, they closed the gate behind, and suddenly there were all kinds of horrible German Shepherds that were trying to attack us, growling, and they were all fed on -- on human flesh, on the prisoners" flesh, that they were just -I--1I--I--TI will never forget the sight of these dogs -- and I love dogs, but <span class="page-break" number="70"></span> Interview with Julian Kulski " September 25, 2014</p><p> these were just wild animals, horrible. And then finally they opened the other gate, took us in, and there they put us on one side of the room; the man, on the other side the women, and I was standing, my face to the wall. And I tried to make contact with Steffa(ph) across the room, I turned my head, and one of the Germans hit me on the wall, and my nose started bleeding. So that was di -- di -- the first time I knew that I was -- lost my freedom. Then they took me, and took everything away from me, and shaved my head. And being a 13 year old, all I was worried about is, how am I going to go on dates? You know, instead of worrying about my life, I was worried about my hair. It just shows the mentality of a 13 year old. Then I was thrown into a cell, which was supposed to be for one person, and there were six of us altogether. It was jammed, and at night we had to sleep like sardines across the room. In order to turn over, we had to all do it at the same time, because we just stuck, wall to wall. And then, in the middle of the night, you heard the executions squads in th -- in the outside, and the cries of the people being shot, and tortured.</p><p>Th-There were all kind -- poor food, hardly any food.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was the -- definitely the youngest one. And for all the strange things, I was selected by the adults to be the one to be representative, because every morning the door opened, and I had to report, in German, that six prisoners, all here, everything in order. I was very short, and then I had the door slammed in my face. But, was the same in -- in -- in -- in a prisoner of war camp later.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The prisoners selected me, right, right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you speak German?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Very little, very little. Oh, I had this German nanny, but I didn't want to learn German, | hated her. But that was u -- turned useful. I understood more then, than I could speak. And I knew a few words. I knew enough to say that. And then, one day, I was taken for -- to the Gestapo headquarters for examinations, for torture, and we were in a prison van, and I was with Steffa(ph), and we were able to -- finally to agree on the same story, so that each one of us would tell the same story about Ludwig, and everything else. And that was the last time I saw her. From the -- there, she was sent to Auschwitz, where she survived the war, but she didn't know that Ludwig was killed on the streets a few weeks later. So when she would -- got to <span class="page-break" number="72"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Julian Kulski = September 25, 2014 Poland, it was a shock, because the first thing she was looking forward to, was to see Ludwig, whom she la -- was crazy about.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But I was taken, and put into a cage, which we -- we called the streetcars, because it was a narrow room with about 16 so-called chairs, very uncomfortable, wooden bench. And we had to sit back to the main corridor, where the Gestapo men walked back and forth. And this was the beginning of the torture, because at the end of the corridor were the torture chambers, and we could hear the cries of the prisoners being tortured. And then, they would put these people into the same room with us. Women without breasts, with the eyes cut out, with the fingers pulled out.</p><p>You know, kind of inhuman. So you sat there for about 48 hours, without food, without all these thing, and then the German would playing -- they had the radio, and they were playing the German tunes, and they were cooking steaks. So that the -- this was all -- you had all the senses, which were -- were starved, after two weeks in the prison, and then two days with no food. And the music, the cries of the being tortured, the -- a-a-and the -- and the smell of the food, and the music were -- that completely wrecked you, so by the time you -- I was taken upstairs into one of the examination rooms. They asked me if I speak German, I said no, I didn't know a <span class="page-break" number="73"></span> Interview with Julian Kulski " September 25, 2014</p><p> word, so they had to have a translator. That was one thing that Ludwig prepared me, so that gave me a time to come out with a answer, a lie, while the translator was translating it. My father did the same thing, when he was arrested. And they -- first, they wanted to know my relationship with Ludwig, so I -- 1--1I--I mentioned all the things, and I told them that I want to help them find him, because I hated him. And so they said, well, will you join us? I said, of course, anything to -- to -- to -- to -- to find him. And then they gave me a book full of pictures of freedom fighters, a ba -- very thick book, and made me look at each picture, and -- to see if I recognized anybody. And I recognized one, and I said -- and he said, who is it, where do you get it? I said, well, he's in my cell in Pawiak prison. When they knew I was making fun of them, I got really hit behind the head with the whip.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- picked out somebody that I knew, but I did -- there was a picture of Ola(ph), there was a picture of Ludwig, and there were a picture of other members of -- that I knew, that I didn't say anything. The -- they -- then they started beating me. Then after beating, they again started talking me into it, that they fight -- just lead them to Ludwig, I will -- ?"ll--T'll--I can join the Gestapo, and I will be well off, and "m so young, it's a pity, and so it was bad guy and good guy routine. Then they made me look through the secret files, to see if I find something, that I would stop and be interested. Which is amazing, because I was being ab -- able to see all of the Polish and Jewish underground fighting organization they had the file -- files on. But then towards the evening after the -- all this beating and -- and -- and starvation and torture, they asked me where Ludwig worked. I said, well, he worked as a -- taking care of some gardens. So he -- they put -- took me to a map of the city, and they saw a building in the middle of the gardens, and they says, what is it? I said, well, it's just a garden shed. But actually, we -- Ludwig had a German car there, and some arms. So they piled me up into the car, it was an evening. There were again two Mercedes, open cars, with machine guns on the sides. And I remember we went through the center of Warsaw, it was a beautiful, sunny day. And I was bald, I was starving, and I could see the human be -- you know, the normal life. I almost felt <span class="page-break" number="75"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Julian Kulski " September 25, 2014 like cr-crying. And there were two ways to the garden, one was from the bottom, from the Vistula, and the one from the top. And I knew that if we came from the top there was a gate, then whoever was there could escape. So we came up from the top, and sure enough, the German car said p-o-l, polizei on the -- on the -- they recognized right away as a Gestapo car. And by the time we got down [indecipherable] escaped. Ludwig wasn't there, but fortunately, he took everything out of that building before that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Beforehand.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: So then they took me back, and they had one more day of tortures, and then they send me back to -- back to Pawiak prison. And then, about two and a half weeks, three weeks later, they were calling out names, those to be executed, those to be sent to Auschwitz, and I was on the list to the Auschwitz, so --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did people know at that point what Auschwitz was?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, perfectly well.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Everybody knew what Auschwitz was, it was a frightening name [indecipherable]. My Uncle Norbert was murdered there in the first year, in 1940.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, how did he get arrested? What happened with him? <span class="page-break" number="76"></span> Interview with Julian Kulski * September 25, 2014</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, they arrested all the Polish leaders of -- the university professors, and -- and leaders of parties, and he was the leader of the Polish Socialist party. So he was a public figure, and --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was his last name?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- and he was arrested th-the same time as my father. And --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see. What was he -- Norbert's last name?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Sorry -- Barlicki.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Barlicki, okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Barlicki, Norbert Barlicki. And my father was also arrested, and my father was arrested for a different reason. During the siege of Warsaw in 1939, there was an American photo reporter by the name of Julien Bryan, who came voluntarily three days after the siege, and was taking pictures, movies. Most of these movies are right now in this museum. They were bought by Holocaust Museum, and restored. And my father took him around Warsaw, taking pictures. Well, a year later, somehow the "Life" magazine, which Julien Bryan's pictures occurred, got to the city hall, and his secretary gave them a copy of this "Life" magazine. He --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Your father.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My father brought it home and hid in the -- in the laundry closet, which during the next Gestapo search, they found the -- the "Life" magazine, and they were <span class="page-break" number="77"></span> ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion Interview with Julian Kulski a September 25, 2014 convinced that my father was a American spy. So this time it was extremely serious, not only that -- that he might be a member of the Polish underground government, which he was, but that he was an American spy. So he was taken to Pawiak, and thrown together with Uncle Norbert. So they spent about two days in prison together, saying goodbye, and that was the last time my father saw Norbert.</p><p>Norbert went to Auschwitz. He helped organize an underground there, and then he was killed there. But my father was released after -- oh, my father was taken to a torture chamber too, and told to take all his clothes. He knew that he was going to be beaten to death. And he was just in the process of taking off his pants, as a senior Gestapo man passed through, and recognized my father. It was the same man that arrested my father in 1939. So he knew that my father was the mayor of Warsaw, and he said to the guys there, don't beat him yet, wait. And my father knew that if -- once they beat you up [indecipherable] they will never let you go -- be alive, because you were a-at -- they couldn't let you out on -- on the streets in condition like that. They didn't want people to know what they were doing. So that saved his life, this time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So the -- the -- the Gestapo who said delay, what made the delay into, don't beat him at all?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I guess he recog -- realized that he was the mayor of Warsaw. <span class="page-break" number="78"></span> Interview with Julian Kulski ia September 25, 2014</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And they let him go.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay, okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because he was -- he was too important for the Germans. The Germans didn't have a way of running the city, and so my father had this unfortunate situation, that he did -- he [indecipherable] his best in a terrible situation, being a -- a -- endangered by the Gestapo, and by the SS, and also by the communist underground, who -- who -- which didn't know -- they threw a bomb at his car while he was going to the city hall one day. And the under -- Polish underground had to notify the communist underground that my father was a member of the underground government, so to desist. But after that my father stopped using the car, and started driving in a dr6zka, in a ca-- ina horse drawn vehicle to show that he had nothing to be afraid of.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm. So let's go back to your imprisonment. So there you are, and you're on the list to go to Auschwitz. What happens?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, the -- evidently somebody in the city hall went over to Leist, and told them that the mayor's son was being sent to Auschwitz. And my father refused to go and ask for -- for -- for my life, because he felt that if he started asking for favors from the Germans, he would really be a collaborator, and he would have to pay -- pay the <span class="page-break" number="79"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Julian Kulski ia September 25, 2014 price for it. But somebody, one of his directors, went to Leist, and Leist must have gotten in touch with Berlin, and Berlin ordered th-the Gestapo in Warsaw to let me go.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Wow.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But when the -- when I was being released, I was sent up to the chief Gestapo man, who was Colonel Hann(ph), who was sitting be-behind a big desk, in a big room, up on the same building where the torture chambers were. And he was under huge painting of Hitler. Enormous painting, f-full -- full wall size. And there was my father and Leist and my father's translator, sitting back. I couldn't say hello to them. They didn't turn around. But I got a lecture from the Major Hahn(ph), he said, I--I know you are a member of the underground. You were caught with -- red- handed, but General Leist says that you are only 14 years old, so we let you go. But next time we catch you, the devil himself is not going to save you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Wow.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: So then I was released, but they followed me everywhere I went in Warsaw, because they thought that I would lead them to Ludwig. So --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Wa -- did you go home to your parents? Ha -- wi --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I went to -- to -- to my parents, right, to my parents" house, but they thought that I would lead them to -- to Ludwig. So they send me to the country place outside of <span class="page-break" number="80"></span> Interview with Julian Kulski " September 25, 2014</p><p> Warsaw, where I spend about a month, and Ludwig came and visited us, and that was the last time I saw him.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And what was this country place called?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Banyoha(ph).</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Banyoha(ph).</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Which is about an hour and a half by narrow gauge railroad [phone ringing]</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Let's just break for a second. [break] So wi--- you were sent to Banyoha(ph).</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>Now, did your mother know of aw -- any of these things that were happening to you?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, she knew that I was in prison, of course.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And I di--she saw me afterwards. There is a picture in the book of my mother's sister, younger sister Zosia(ph) who hid the Katz family, and Ludwig, supposedly with a new haircut, but he was six feet four, so the change in outlook didn't -- it was just question of time when he would be. And everybody begged him to leave the city and go and fight in the woods with the partisans, but he was so involved with the underground in Warsaw that he didn't go. And sure enough, he was caught in one of the regular streetcar searches. They stopped the streetcar, and he and his second in command started running off, and the SS men were running behind him <span class="page-break" number="81"></span> ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion Interview with Julian Kulski a September 25, 2014 and shooting machine guns. And finally he got to a house with a garden, and he was jumping over a fence, and one of the SS men got to him. He ran out of bullets, so they started fighting hand to hand. And Ludwig tried to kill him by -- the German, by biting his throat through, but another German came through and shot him point blank into the -- so when I found out that he was killed there, I ran over there, and his body was already removed, but his brain was still lying on -- on -- on -- on -- on -- o-on -- on the ground. And I just swore that I would revenge him, and every time I killed a German during the uprising, I would say, it's for you. I loved that man.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I wanted to ask you, what did he mean to you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, he was everything. He was my best friend, he was my teacher, he was my scoutmaster, he was my captain. He was the one who got me into the army, and who -- whose ideals -- he was a great orator, and he knew Polish literature by heart.</p><p>And he would -- on every national holiday, he would line us up, all 150 in the company in a line, and would orate the poems of Mickiewicz and Stowacki and Polish -- just to keep up the -- our spirit, our national identity, and our love of freedom. So he was feeding us the things which we as kids, needed most. Love of Poland.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I can't imagine what that must have felt like, to see somebody you loved, and only part of him there. <span class="page-break" number="82"></span> Interview with Julian Kulski 6 September 25, 2014</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He is buried in the military sera -- cemetery now, and every time I got to Warsaw, | go and lay some flowers on his grave.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So his body was discovered, and was buried.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, he was di -- his body was taken to a pol -- police -- police barracks, and then the -- I guess they were buried somewhere, in a -- the place, and after the war he was found, and buried with military honors. He is a -- he is -- after I found out he was killed, I and another boy spent the night tearing up the street signs on the street that we lived -- that he lived, was Karchanjeski(ph) street. Then we repainted it with his pseudo names, and hanged them up, so we renamed the street in his honor.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What were some of his pseudonyms?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He had three; Mihau(ph) -- Michael, Hardy(ph), and Goliut(ph).</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Wow.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He had to change three times, in order to maintain his secrecy. The last one was Goliat(ph). And Goliat(ph) is the one that I took over after I was arrested. Before that, it was Chernatski(ph), but I -- I change it to Goliat(ph) in his honor.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: After you were released, did you have a chance to talk to your own father about what had gone on in prison, or about anything?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: A little, a little. I think he knew. He went through it himself, so he knew perfectly well what I went through. It didn't take much. I talked a lot to Ludwig <span class="page-break" number="83"></span> Interview with Julian Kulski * September 25, 2014</p><p> when he came over and spent the night, in the country. He -- all he wanted to know, what happened to Steffa(ph), and how she was. And he congratulated me for not spilling the beans under the torture. He pro -- proposed me for a medal, and he was just proud of me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What kind of activities did you get involved with after these things?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, after this, I was just so full of hate, and a desire for revenge on these beasts, on the Germans, that killed my friends in the ghetto, and outside, that I went in search of wet -- disarming German soldiers. And I and another guys were able to get some old guns. I had a old American western Colt, about this size. And we spent the whole night looking for Germans, individual Germans that we could catch and disarm, without killing them, because for every German, there were 20 to a hundred Poles, innocent civilians, shot on the same place. This mass [indecipherable]. And we find -- in the morning, we found downtown, a--a---a sergeant, a big sergeant, with a beautiful gun on his side, getting onto the front of the streetcar, which was only Nur fiir Deutschen, only for Germans, and we followed him. But besides this sergeant, there were five other soldiers, regular soldiers with rifles. And they all got off at the railroad station, the Danzig-Warsaw railroad station, near Zoliborz. And we thought we would run down the steps, and hid under the viaduct, and disarm him before the other soldiers came down. Well, <span class="page-break" number="84"></span> ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion Interview with Julian Kulski * September 25, 2014 we faced him with both our guns, and said [indecipherable] or you are dead. And he, instead of raising his hands, being a seasoned soldier, started opening up his gun, and pulling out. So it was a question us or them, and we both fired, and he fell on his face. And he was the first German that I killed. And my initial reaction was, they were supposed to be supermen, and yet they were human. You were able to kill them. You know, as a 13 year old boy, I was -- I -- I was surprise. And then, of course, we saw the four guys coming towards us, about 20 feet ahead of us, and they saw what was happening, so we started running. And they took the rifles off and started shooting at us, and we run up the embankment, and near the ghetto walls, and by the ghetto walls we got to downtown. And then, on the way back, we're told not to go through -- near the station, because the German were arresting people left and right. And next day they killed 20 women and children on that spot.</p><p>There is a sign, and every time I go there, I feel responsible for the death of these poor people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Th -- so was that -- that is something that's been a burden for you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, for your whole life. It's -- it-- and I mean, it wasn't my fault, it was a matter of life and death, it was war, but the results were something that ver-very deeply -- first it was that boy, and now the 20 women and children. And it was after that that my father send me to the countryside again, to try to hide me. <span class="page-break" number="85"></span> Interview with Julian Kulski * September 25, 2014</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. And then after that, how did life progress? What happened?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, then I -- I --1I--- I was -- the commandoes heard about my actions, and I was able to join them. And the commandoes had the advantage, that they were responsible carrying out the -- the death sentence on Poles who sold Jews to the Germans, who were traitorous, who were collaborators. A-And so, we had an opportunity to kill some Germans legally after that. It was, again, pretty horrible, because we had to go into their homes, sometimes kill the family, as well as the individual, because they we -- they were well armed, and they would defend themselves during the execution.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's huge.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Then, we were all praying that there will be an uprising, and the commanders were ordered in full, under arms, for 10 days before. And we're all, my whole unit, about 14 of us were housed in my father's house. So my father, of course, knew every day about it, that we're hidden there, fully armed. And they used to bring the food, big cauldrons of soup once a day, for all of us. And we couldn't wait to have the uprising. And then on the first of August, we got orders to go and retrieve arms for the whole company, from our secret place. And we're carrying it across one of the major streets, and the German car, because they were expecting something, saw us and started firing at us. So the Warsaw uprising was started by the six of us, by <span class="page-break" number="86"></span> Interview with Julian Kulski * September 25, 2014</p><p> accident. It was supposed to start at five o'clock in the afternoon, and this was two o'clock. So the Germans were able to bring tanks, and --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: This was in the center city?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: This was in the city, in Zoliborz, in Warsaw.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, in your neighborhood?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In our na -- in my neighborhood.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So this was ma -- my whole -- I spent the whole occupation and -- and the whole battle in -- in Zoliborz, fighting --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So we're talking --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: --on ground that I knew.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. So, in other words, we're talking August 1*, 1944.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's when the uprising starts. And you're saying that you f-- the entire time of the uprising, you stayed in your neighborhood?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What kind of activities did you take part in? <span class="page-break" number="87"></span> ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion Interview with Julian Kulski "!</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>September 25, 2014</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, the first time, I fa -- I fought -- I was fighting, I got the g-- my rifle, which was 1939 Polish rifle, and I was able to shoot across the street at the Germans, while they were shooting at us. Then, after they left, there was one wounded, and one killed, we had to go around, and get across another boulevard. And th -- th-th- there was a tank standing and machine-gunning us as we were jumping over. And this was the first day of the uprising, that I got wounded. I got f-- hit in my arm. It was something that not incapacitated me, because on the other side, there were nurses. They took care of it, and I was able to continue fighting. Then that night, the commandant of the -- our section of -- the Zoliborz section, decided that the Germans knew already about it, and they were winning, so we -- he took us out into the Kampinos forest, which was about 15 -- 20 miles outside of the city. We march all night. And then, while -- the next day we got an order from the commandant of the Warsaw, of the whole city, to return, and we had to return. On the return, we were -- we had to fight a very big battle with some German Luftwaffe near the airport, military airport, to get back to our own homes. And we lost quite a few. My comma -- commander was badly wounded, we had to leave him behind. And then we got home, and the civilian population was very excited, and just like during the ghetto uprising, the -- the Jewish -- Polish fighters raised the -- the Jewish and Polish flags. The Polish flags were flying from every home, and we were welcomed, and -- <span class="page-break" number="88"></span> Interview with Julian Kulski " September 25, 2014</p><p> by the civilians, and they helped us build barricades. So we build the barricades, and we mounted the front lines, and the Germans -- when the Germans started attacking, we would let them go behind our positions. They were stopped at the barricades, and then they would get into fire from our buildings, and from behind the barricade. So th-they lost quite -- in the first few days, they lost a lot of soldiers.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The Germans did.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The German.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Also I--I took a prisoner, one of the Germans. And he was -- th-the -- the Germans were bullies, and when they were in power, they were heartless, but when they were captured, they were cowards. And this old guy that I captured, ges -- started kissing my feet, begging me not to shoot him. And I said, well, we do not shoot prisoners. But they knew that they shot us, because they didn't consider us army, they considered us bandits. So wa -- there was no way of surrendering. We knew that we had to fight, or kill, ourselves. Because the way they killed us would be the much more cruel way.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. What happened to this German prisoner?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I took him over to the back, and he, together with other German prisoners, did some helping in the military kitchen, and d-digging up passages underground. <span class="page-break" number="89"></span> Interview with Julian Kulski " September 25, 2014</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Trenches, and th-they were employed, and he always smiled at me when he saw me. He was an Austrian, and he was trying to tell me he was not a Nazi, he was -- had a big family, please don't kill him. I had no respect for him.</p></p></dialogue>

So the Germans came in and took the order, and in the first day, they killed almost 100,000 innocent women, children, babies. It was a massacre.

We did win with tremendous losses, but we won the f-- for two months, and the Germans that captured us, and who fought in Stalingrad said that the battle of "44 in Warsaw was worse than Stalingrad.

It was hard on them, and hard on us, but it was -- we had the advantage, because it was our city, we knew every comer, practically in Zoliborz, and we could defend ourselves better than attacking.</p></p></dialogue>

About a week before the end of the uprising, I got pneumonia, which then turned into TB. And I was very, very weak, and my father was wounded in the sewers, and -- with gangrene in his leg. So we lay in our house.</p><p>But when the German tanks started approaching, my father forced me to get out of bed, although I had huge fever, and I could hardly walk. And we walked -- he took me back to the front lines, because he felt I would be safer in the company, as a -- as a soldier, than being caught as a insurgent with a gun, and wounded, because they were shooting all the wounded prisoners. They didn't take prisoners, they were killing them. Hospitals and everybody. So he took me there, and the whole city was in a flame. It was extremely hot and stinking, and I was given a anti-tank weapon, which I could hardly handle. And I was firing at one of the tanks, and I hit the tank, and the tank started firing. But there was another stan -- tank standing by, and he saw the window from which I fired, and he turned the gun, and fired at my window.</p><p>And just before he fired, I jumped out.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- shell was going above my head. So, it was worth it to survive. And then wo -- we were supposed to fight our way to the Vistula, and the Russians were supposed to send boats to pick us up. And of course, they didn't, and the Germans knew about it, and that's why they forced our command -- our general to surrender, because we -- the -- we knew that we will be all killed by the artillery and tank fire, before we reached the Vistula even.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no, my father said goodbye as he took me two days before that, and he told me at that time that if I survive the prison camp, which was doubtful because of my pneumonia and TB, I should not go back to Poland until Poland is free and independent, but try to go to London, and to his brother, who was in the Polish embassy in London. So that's what I did.

It was an international camp. Just leave Poles and Russians and the Slavs behind, to be liberated by the Russian army. And th -- it -- the war was still going on. I could never figure out how they were allowed to cross the line, because the line was on the Elb, and this was quite a f-- halfway b -- to Berlin. And evidently what happened was that the American army sent some parachute jumpers to jump -- to jump into the camp, to prevent the Germans from murdering the prisoners of war before they are liberated. Well, they were all caught, and they were sent to the commanding officer, the German commanding officer. And they explained to him that if he allows the American trucks to cross the line, they will -- they can liberate all of the prisoners, and the German didn't want, obviously, to <span class="page-break" number="98"></span> Interview with Julian Kulski " September 25, 2014</p><p> have the western prisoners fall into Russian hands, the way that the western allies didn't, so he agreed to it. And they were allowed to go through the German lines, all the way to the camp, and arrive at the camp and started loading American prisoners.</p><p>And I had made friends with a Polish-American from Chicago, and I was standing at the gate, the Germans didn't care, the gates were opened, and he kind of waved me in, and I couldn't walk, so they got me onto the truck. And the truck drivers were supposed to be unarmed, they were supposed to be Red Cross, which they were not. And boys will be boys, they all had machine guns above the in -- and I remember they stopped to shoot at a deer, and then they disarmed a couple of German officers in one of these little towns. We went about 75 - 80 miles an hour through these little, narrow, German towns. And we got to the other side of the river. Well, they still carried me into the barracks, and the next day -- we had about two, three days, and we started walking already. They carried me. And I -- th-they wanted to take me as an American prisoner of war, and smuggle me to America, and I said no, I explained with my hands, because I didn't speak English, that I wanted to go to London. So they thought, oh, this kid is really crazy, he doesn't want to go to America. But there were a couple of British Tommies walking by, and they explained that this guy -- this kid want -- was crazy, but he wants to go to London.

I had -- I just disgraced myself in-in -- in -- in -- in the thing, and I'm surprised that my -- if they could they would have thrown me out of that thing, was -- I was so sick I couldn't sit, I couldn't -- and I couldn't stand and there was no place to sit down. It was a cattle train, like the same trains that they took people to gas chambers. And they wouldn't -- I remember we stopped in Berlin, there was a big allied air raid, and so that pleased us enormously. And then we got to the camp, and they didn't have any space, the camp <span class="page-break" number="105"></span> ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion Interview with Julian Kulski " September 25, 2014 was so full. And it was rainy, it was cold, it was wet. So I had to spend about two, three nights on the ground.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you're already sick.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: With the -- raining on me, already sick. So I-- I was pretty much dying when some English nurse found me, and they took me to a TB hos -- so-called hospital.</p><p>And there were -- we didn't have any beds, it was just the same wooden benches as in an -- any other concentration camp, or prisoner of war camp. And the only difference between concentration camp and -- and a prison camp was that they tried to kill you with -- by not feeding you. So it was starvation and hard work. They would send you to coal mines and stone quarries, and you lasted about a week. But because I had TB, and I was dying, they didn't send me to -- to work. And that's -- that's how I survived. And once I got out of being sick, I went specially and -- and -- and -- to another barrack where they had certain diseases of skin, and I got it myself, so that -- it was very unpleasant, very horrible, but that kept me from going to the -- to the -- so I survived, but I was skin and bones at the end, and depressed, and I really wanted to die there. But it -- it was horrible.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay then, let's go back to England now. At the very beginning of our interview, you said that your doctors in -- in Britain --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Military doctor. <span class="page-break" number="106"></span> Interview with Julian Kulski " September 25, 2014</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Military doctor, suggested that one of the ways you could heal is by writing down what happened to you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, there were two things, one was the physical. They didn't know how to take care of escaped prisoners of war, and they put me on normal diet; egg, rich milk and everything. The result was that my body turned into huge carbuncles. I just couldn't absorb rich food, and it almost killed me with the good, rich food. But th-the worst thing was the psychological. I had nightmares. I would keep on fighting in the middle of the night. I would end up standing up on the -- my bed, and I threw the side lamp in the corner because I thought I was throwing grenades. And I wa--I was in -- in no condition to go into normal life, let alone any kind of education. So the doctor suggested that I write down my memoirs, ma -- in the form of a diary.</p><p>And I sat down -- I was very fortunately to be invited -- -- 1--I had very bad relations with my uncle. My uncle was a member -- was a completely different man from my father. He was 10 years younger, he never fought in any war, he was a very comfortable, childless couple, lived for themselves, and just a real diplom -- a gr -- diplomats [indecipherable]. So when I arrived, he blamed me for the Warsaw uprising. And I'd lost my friends, my whole city, my whole family. And they wanted to adopt me. So, we didn't get along, but fortunately, there was a English aristocrat, who was a member of parliament, a woman called Lady Ida Copeland, <span class="page-break" number="107"></span> Interview with Julian Kulski m September 25, 2014</p><p> who was a Member of Parliament, in 1935 visited Warsaw with a group of British MPs, and was entertained at the city hall by my father. So when the word got through the British government, that the son of the president of Warsaw arrived in such a terrible shape, she invited me into her palatial estate in Cornwall. And so I found myself from hell, in heaven. I was met at -- at Truro in -- in Cornwall by a chauffeur with a Rolls Royce, and I was taken to the this gorgeous vi -- house, right on the waterfront, with hundreds of acres of land. It -- the -- the family was the Copeland china, the famous china. And she was very interested in Polish affairs.</p><p>She was a good friend of Ignacy Paderewski, and she put me in the same bedroom that he had, with a view of the -- 0-0-of the -- the ocean.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell -- tell people who was Ignacy Paderewski.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Ignacy Paderewski was the great Polish pianist, and prime minister in the first World War.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And--</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So what kind of -- wa -- you say you -- you hadn't -- you suffered from nightmares.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right. <span class="page-break" number="108"></span> Interview with Julian Kulski m" September 25, 2014</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What kind of personality did you have at that point? How had you been changed, how were you traumatized?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Thad no patience. I had no patience with other people's problems, because I thought they were un -- completely ridiculous and unimportant, in comparison to what I went through, and what my friends, Zula(ph) and Ludwig and everybody else went through. And when they complain about the weather, or complain about th-the clothes, or complain about anything, I had no patience, and I was very, very difficult to live with for that reason. Because, after all, everybody's problems is a big problem, but at that time I didn't realize. And 1-i-i-it went through -- at least through my first marriage, that I wasn't a very good husband. And I went through what now everybody recognize as the post traumatic --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Stress disorder.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- stress syndrome. But in those days nobody knew, so they almost killed me with good food, and they almost -- and didn't recognize my problems. But, I was lucky, because in -- Lady Copeland became my fairy godmother. She not only -- well, I-- 1 -- when J arrived there, I arrived in my battle dress, and my duffle bag.</p><p>When I got to the bedroom, there was a black tie ready, and the regular clothes that she bought, shoes. And every night we would dress for dinner. This was still -- it was as -- 60 room house, and some beautiful antiques, and beautif -- anten -- and <span class="page-break" number="109"></span> Interview with Julian Kulski " September 25, 2014</p><p> interesting people, and at breakfast I am a -- we would just help ourselves, we had a big buffet, and that's where I got all that rich food that almost killed me. But she -- in the afternoon -- in -- in the morning and early afternoon, I would write my story down, and then she would take me for rides in ca -- when she -- and she was very involved in social life. And I always, always went with her in her Rolls Royce, driving around. And I remember one day on the radio of the Rolls Royce came through information that Winston Churchill lost the elections, and she burst in tears, because she was very close friend of Churchill's. And that's the only time that I was able to take her into my arms, the old lady, and try to cheer her up. But she didn't -- after I left and went back to London, she arranged to have me go and be admitted to the top elite school in northern Ireland, the Eaton of northern Ireland, and I spent a year and a half there, being a normal schoolboy.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Amazing. Amazing, how could that happen?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, the headmaster and the masters all knew my story, but on purpose they didn't allow me to get involved with it. So I-- I--I was on the crew, I did all the sports, and I learned English, of course. I excelled in English literature. I had problems in mathematics and -- and -- and physics, chemistry, but I was very good in history and in English. I was a top student. And then I got my Oxford and Cambridge school certificate, and I had a choice of what I was going to become, a <span class="page-break" number="110"></span> Interview with Julian Kulski m September 25, 2014</p><p> lawyer, doctor or architect. I wanted to be a brain surgeon, but in order to get into a medi -- school of medicine, you had to learn Latin, and I was just learning English, and that didn't appeal to me, so I decided to become an architect. And then I was admitted to Oxford next year, and --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: This would be what year?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: This was -- well, I got there in 1945, I stayed through -- I graduated in the end of 1946 with Oxford and Cambridge school certificate. It was 1947 -- 1947 - deg48.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That you entered Oxford?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That I entered Oxford for not quite a year. I was a very rebellious student still, and I didn't like the traditional curriculum, and I was thrown out because I was -- instead of doing a house for a British ambassador in Athens, I was doing Frank Lloyd Wright's house in Arizona. So I left, and then I got my visa and came to America.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, how did -- how did that -- well, first of all, I want to go back a little bit with your schooling. For somebody who had had no formal schooling throughout those very formative years, of you know, middle school and high school gymnasium, as it would be in Europe --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right. <span class="page-break" number="111"></span> Interview with Julian Kulski "" September 25, 2014</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- how is it that only a year and a half schooling got you up to faw -- college level? That's an amazing achievement.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, not only to college level, I never went to college. I went straight to --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The university?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, to -- went to the -- the master's degree. I didn't --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You didn't -- you bypassed a bachelor's.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The graduate school.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You went to graduate school.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, to graduate school. So I-- I --I had kindergarten, two years, then I had a year and a half high school, and then I went to graduate school. And my feeling is that so many years are wasted i-in college. Th-Th-Th -- if-- if the high school is at a high level -- and the high school in -- in England was excellent. It was at least second year of college, if not third. So that when I got to Yale, they -- they wanted -- oh, there's another funny story, if you want to hear about it. When I was still at Oxford School of Architecture, I applied to three schools in America; to Harvard, Yale, and another school. And Yale se -- was the one who showed interest in me, but they asked for a -- the credit hours from Oxford. So I went to the dean of the school of architecture in Oxford, and -- Dr. Rice, and I said, well, here is the letter.</p><p>Can you write a letter and tell them how many credit hours? And he said, what? <span class="page-break" number="112"></span> ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion Interview with Julian Kulski " September 25, 2014 These Americans are crazy. You know that you are here working seven days a week, 12 hours a day. And he added it all up in seven hours, and I had more credit hours than -- than a PhD. So when I got to Yale, they did -- they wanted to put me in the last year of graduate school.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh my gosh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And I had to convince them that I didn't learn anything at Oxford. I insisted on repeating the first year, and it was the best decision I made.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh my goodness.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: But I was a scholarship student, I had the -- I had no money, and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did you have any family in the United States?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I had my uncle, but I-- I --1I---1I- we had no -- no contact.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That meant your father's brother from London?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right, right, he ended up as a professor at the University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But we -- we -- we -- we-we broke relations altogether. We just couldn't get along. So he didn't help me at all. And then, coming over on the Queen Mary, I met an American girl, and a year later, I married her. So I became an American <span class="page-break" number="113"></span> Interview with Julian Kulski m September 25, 2014</p><p> citizen very quickly. And she -- we were married through Yale graduate school, and had children.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. How many children did you have?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Two.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Two. And why did you leave the U.K. for the United States?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Why did I leave United Kingdom?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Correct.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, there was -- I think one was an architectural reason. I didn't like traditional architecture. I wanted to do modern architecture, and America beckoned, from library and everything I saw, Frank Lloyd Wright and Louis Kahn and th-the great American architects were here. The second, I felt that I wanted to become a full citizen of a country. I knew I couldn't go back to Poland because it was under Russian occupation. And I knew that I would have better chance of becoming American than a British citizen. And -- but my British friends felt that 1 was making a big mistake, and they were very sorry to see me go, but -- and when I arrived here, I realized how lucky I was in England. A, I was part of the elite, I had veterans benefits, I -- th-the government paid for my education at Oxford, and here I arrive with five dollars in my pocket, and the -- without knowing anybody. I -- again, I couldn't -- I went to uncle, but we -- we couldn't get along, so I left, and I arrived in <span class="page-break" number="114"></span> Interview with Julian Kulski " September 25, 2014</p><p> Boston with five dollars in my pocket, I couldn't find work. I went to -- tried to find work as a ste-stevedore, and -- a-and they laughed me off. So I was starving for about a month. And finally, I got to Cape Cod, where my future wife lived, and I became a waiter. And I was trained, and then started saving money, and that paid for the first year of Yale.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Amazing, amazing. In some ways you've answered this question in part, but how did what you experienced shape you? What kind of a person did it make you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, physically, if something doesn't kill you, it makes you stronger. You probably know from the people who were in Siberia that didn't die, they -- they became stronger. The climate, the conditions, and particularly during the growing up years, development years, physically, you become stronger. Also, having experience all the difficulties, you become much stronger as a person, and you don't allow anything to keep you from your career goals. So I knew what I wanted to be, and I was able to do it, and to conquer all the difficulties.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did the nightmares go away?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And I think it's all thanks -- sorry?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did the nightmares go away? Did the nightmares go away? <span class="page-break" number="115"></span> Interview with Julian Kulski " September 25, 2014</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Mostly, yes. And-- and I have kept it out by writing about it, by sharing this with other people, to prepare American kids for life. And I find that very satisfactory, and have a lot -- made a lot of friends.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did -- when you met your family again, tha -- your parents, and I take it your sister must have stayed in Poland, is that right?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That would have been 1959 - 1960?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In those years.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The first time. What -- did you have the opportunity to find out and talk about the things that you couldn't talk about during the war years?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Some. I saw -- I met Steffa(ph), who was out -- straight out of Auschwitz with her number on the leg, and I-- I bought some flowers, I took it. So we tooked -- I talked with Steffa(ph) about Ludwig, and about those things. And I talked with my parents, but since we were in constant correspondence, I knew what was happening there, and they knew about my life. But was great, the getting back, but Warsaw was not the same place. And the thing which I really missed, was the Jewish section of Warsaw, because it was completely destroyed, and never rebuilt. So the place where there is the Jewish memorial, the Jewish history museum, now was -- these <span class="page-break" number="116"></span> Interview with Julian Kulski " September 25, 2014</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> were residential streets, with beautiful architecture, and it's all gone. A-And so, I--I get lost in that part of the ci-city. The old city, and certain monuments, and Zoliborz, the place that I was brought up, has changed very little.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Does your family house still stand?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, well, had -- they had -- that stands, but they had to sell it during the war, because my father's salary was so inadequate, it lasted only for five days of the month, the rest of the time my mother had to bring in food, and -- and -- and sell it on the black market. So they -- they had to -- my mother had to sell all the jewelry, and they -- finally, they had to sell the house, with the understanding that we could live til the end of the war. But they used the money to pay off the -- the debt on the house, and bought a si-- a country house, where my mother had the garden.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Di--- were there any actions about -- against your father, or for your father, after the country went communist, given that he had a prominent position.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's a very good question, and they're being asked all the time. Yes, my father was offered ministerial positions in the communist government, which he refused.</p><p>So he lived in a very -- in a workers" house, a tiny, little place, and -- a-and -- and in real poverty. But he never, of course, joined the communists. So the -- he was an <span class="page-break" number="117"></span> ontactrefiranneGaushariarg a hither atrmedortabeattfiexaliaton Interview with Julian Kulski mt September 25, 2014 enemy of the state. They knew about it. But fortunately, before the war, he was involved as vice-president, building a lot of workers" housing. And the socialists, who were in the first communist government, remembered his contributions for social welfare to the people, and one of them became his protector. And he pi-- not only protected his life, but the whole family. So th -- he did whatever he could, you know. He didn't last in his job very long, but he was well-placed, and high government official, and he was able to save them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, that meant that -- [technical interruption, break] So, we were talking about postwar, and -- and that there was some -- your father had a protector in the socialist party, which at first was allied with the communist party in Poland.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was this gentleman's name?</p></p></dialogue>

When -- did he also arrange for a place for him to -- to live?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, he couldn't do much, there was so little housing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And the only housing that was left were the pre -- the very, very workers" houses that my father and he worked on before the war.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So that was where my father ended.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And did your father have -- what kind a work did he do, or did he do any work [indecipherable] afterward?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My father was work in Gdansk for a shipping company, and then he came to Warsaw for the last few years he worked, and the rebuilding the housing in the city, and then he went -- retired, and I was -- I was able to get him to s -- to come to America for a few weeks, few days.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: To visit me here. <span class="page-break" number="119"></span> Interview with Julian Kulski es September 25, 2014</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Is there anything else that you think we should talk about, that we should explore here today, in having discussed all these unbelievable years, and unbelievable events that happened to you, that you think is important for people to know about?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I think it's important to know that freedom is not free, that you have to remember it on a daily basis. You have to teach this to the children, so the history wouldn't repeat itself. And I'm afraid history does repeat itself. We can see that in -- in what's happening in the world today. The middle -- Middle East, Ukraine. And I think that our children are being disadvantaged by not being educated properly about the Holocaust, about the second World War, about the need to be on guard to save your independence. Just because we had forefathers who fought in the revolution, and made this country, doesn't mean that we have to lower our guard, and not defend it on a daily basis. And you have things happening, which shouldn't be happening. People being hurt which shouldn't be hurt. And I think it's the -- for example, the scout movement, which I think is extremely important in training the character of the young people, is being maligned. There's many high school kids, who when they try to be patriotic, or -- or -- are being discouraged for -- or -- or even thrown out of school for carrying flags, or saying -- believing in God, or in -- in-- in --in--1in things which are good, and higher, and which will prepare them for -- and -- <span class="page-break" number="120"></span> 124 Interview with Julian Kulski September 25, 2014 an-and not spoiling the children. I think it's a terrible thing to -- just because the parents have an easier life, they make it so easy for the children that they go and look for satisfaction with drugs, and smoking and sex, and -- and -- and all kinds of bad things, because they lack ideology. And I think they're starved for the ideology.</p><p>And I find that when I talk to the groups of young people, they are just starved for my words, they -- because they don't get it at home, they don't get it in school.</p></p></dialogue>
