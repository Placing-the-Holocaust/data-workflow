<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I would be delighted. My name is Israel Gruzin. I born in Lithuania, in Slobodka, they say in a place I born in 1928, December the 28th but now I am putting myself on May the 4th, and I am going to tell you the story.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You're going to tell us the story later?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell us a little bit about your life in Slobodka and about your family and your brothers and sisters, if you have any?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I had a brother, of course. I was born in Lithuania, in Slobodka, in Vilijampole. We had a normal life. My father was not a millionaire but he made a nice living. He was doing some business with Russians and things like this, and it was binders from boot sales and selling this from the houtgarba(ph) to make leather out of it. | was going to school. I was going, of course, to Cheder, a Hebrew school and my brother the same thing. And we was going on a normal life. Of course, we had the little- the Lithuanians was not always with Jews. There was stories all over the place, but we had a normal life and living like normal people, and then, of course, in 1940 came the Russians because the war started already with the Germans. It was not a war yet, but when the Germans came to Poland -- but the Russians came to Lithuania and then the Russians occupied Lithuania close to a year, and then the war started in 1940.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell me what changed when the Russians came.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was a little different because you will -- I was going to a, to Hebrew school and then all of a sudden I was going to a Jewish school. They are cutting down on the religious part.</p><p>They were trying to make all the children like sort like patriotic and, of course, when you're young you think is the future. But my father was always against the regime because of Communism. In fact, he got arrested one time. One time he got a chicken he was carrying this to the street and he was stopped. What do you have a chicken for? And he was afraid to tell everything to go to officially. They arrested him and after a couple hours, but they let them out. They didn't want to get the men for the chicken. You can imagine my father didn't care much for the Communists. But I was not myself. I liked the movie and things like that. But it was really normal. It was a little different with the new regime, but I was too young to see the difference.</p></p></dialogue>

I was the younger and he was a year older. We were riding one time and I was saying, let me ride, let me ride, and all of sudden there was a few boys, not Jewish, and one of them got a stick and put it right in the springs and he broke the bicycle, and like young boys, of course, we chasing them. You broke the bicycle. How come you broke the bicycle? And where I was living in -- we got a little farther out -- was a church and we chased them to the church and, of course, course the police came out and let the two buys in and he put the foot in this door and he told us, go away you Zyds. I told them and this time, of course, I spoke. I forgot --Lithuanian, I was going born there-- them I told him he broke the bicycle and he kept saying, go away. Of course, I couldn't fight him. It was experience. We came back home and my father took this bicycle to the man that fixed the bicycle and fixed it. But you had a feeling like you were always not so welcome, like because I'm Jewish.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you have Lithuanian friends?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Like I said, I was neighbors with a few of them, but in general I was in the Cheder. But in the area I was living there was Jewish people. But we had a few people from the</p><p> a restaurant there. His son was a little friendly with us, and we were playing as <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> small little horse and we are using it to take the coals from -- it was a little like a pony. It was like a dog. You talk to him like a dog and this horse was doing things that were believable. And my father had two horses but my father took the smaller horse and the wagon and take the few things we can take with us, and we made the journey to run away from the Lithuania. And the Germans were always bombing the airport, and a lot of Jews start running to get away from the army.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And this is in 1941?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: This is in 1941. And only the same time these bombs was falling and, of course, the Lithuanians were so happy to see the Germans coming, they're sabotaging the Russian Army tanks, putting on fire and burning 6 the tire and shooting on them. And all of sudden their own rifles and putting on the Lithuania uniform and really taking advantage of the situation and start right away with the Jews, of course, but we didn't have enough -- it was too fast. We left. They day they started throwing the bombs, my father took the horse and wagon and we was going to get out of there. And we are running the streets with the Russian Army and we were going to Latvia. A lot of people in this area. You can go to Latvia and then to Minsk, and then from Minsk to White Russia, but we didn't make the journey so far. We just took that horse and wagon. We have involved with the Russian Army and then, of course, the Germans were bombing the streets and we were going through the hole. I say the Holocaust, dead people right away from the first time, and my mother, in fact, was shot, slit. The bomb cut in her leg we were running in this way. We were going in the same direction as the Russian army. There was always fires and dead people on the streets and a lot of them couldn't make it. You know, the soldiers and a lot of people riding the horses didn't make it. We kept on going and then, of course, we came to the border of Latvia. We came in at Minsk. There was a lot of Latvian people there, but we hear right away from the Gentile people that something going on, terrible things going on against the Jews, even in Minsk. But we were lucky and we were still going in the car with the Russians, the army. But the army was really practically 99 percent in a chaos, didn't know what they are doing. One was running right and one was running left, and then I remember one thing, that we were running, going with the wagon and two Jewish guys came over and said you have to give us a ride. My father said, Look, I got a little tiny horse. We have four people. We won't make it. They took out a revolver and they point it at my father. They said, look, you are going to sit down and we are going with you. Also because we can't walk. They might look a little Communist inclined, I don't know. Maybe they are soldiers, and then we are running like this. Not running, driving and driving and driving and then, all of a sudden we had an attack with machine guns and I felt -- I was in the wagon with my mother and my brother and my father was driving the horse and the two men, and then all of a sudden we hear a something. We hear a scream and one of them says, Oy, Oy. We look and then he laying, fall back and a bullet went right in the man part, in this -- right in his, in the part, the men part, and it went in this -- excuse the expression -- right in where it aches for the men. He could feel the bullet. He could touch it. The other man said, don't do nothing. Drive faster the horse. Drive the horse, and then we were already in Latvia, and then we</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And they took him out of the wagon and they said to us, they thanked us for the ride and giving them the ride and we left them right by the water. And I said, how can you leave them by the water? And he said, I made arrangements to the other side because the other side of the river, the Russian Army was a little bit more organized. It could start to fight back. It made like a zone to fight back, and we left them there. My father didn't want to leave the man. After all, he didn't know him and now the man is wounded, and they kept on saying -- I was a boy and I could see that it was his part and there was a bullet, and the other man was going to take it out and my father said, don't do it. You'll kill him. And anyway we left him by the edge of the water and we started going farther. We are already -- my father and my brother and my mother alone, and my father kept the tallis, you know, the tallis what you 9 wear, and he keep it on the wagon with him, and this he took with him. We are going there and then nobody to talk, but luckily my father was fluent in Latvian, is different, similar but different. My mother didn't speak Latvia, and I, of course, didn't and my brother didn't.</p><p>Then he hear some from -- somebody told us that we are Jewish. You are one of them. The Germans were not even there yet. We didn't know what was going on. And go there, make a left and a right there. And there was a farm and there was a Jew. Maybe he can give you directions. Anyway, we came over there. He had a farm and two sons and all kinds of animals there, chickens and cows and pigs, and all this. And there was a little town and the whole people looked like they like them over there because he was a very nice man. And my father said to him, what should we do? And he said, I am in the same boat like you are. The war was going on. We didn't know how long it was going to go. So stay with us for a while. And we stay for two or three days, and then on the other side of the farm was close to the water, maybe a quarter of a mile. And my father said to him, maybe we could go over to the other side. But we couldn't. He wanted to go over. The reason -- I skipped a little bit. The reason we came to this 10 place, he wanted to go to Latvia. The Russian go over to Latvia. There was bridge and the Russian Army exploded the bridge because -- then the tanks and the army. Their own people. There was a lot of Jewish, and on the bridge, we were lucky not to make the time on the bridge. If we were on the bridge we would be exploded too. Right before our eyes we saw the bridge collapsing and there was a lot of Russian people running around in their underpants, really. With their rifles and they couldn't even walk. They got on the other side. We remained on our side and the people on the other side, there was still the army holding the gun. But a couple days on the farm with this man I said to my father, let me see what was going on. And we took the little boat. We really wanted to go over. He said, I can't take anyone right now. I was going in the nighttime. I was not there and my father, said oh, my God, what is going on there? They are fighting with the Germans and <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> he shake hands with him. I got my family and you have yours. I have to go my way. I can't take you where I'm going. We go where we can and then, of course, we made the journey to go back because we couldn't go to the other side. We were trying to go back from where we came. That's why I said the little horse was like a dog. We didn't know where to go and my father said to him, go horse. He didn't know where to go and he was afraid to ask for directions, things like this. And luckily like I said in the beginning, my father speaks Latvia, and we starting to move back in one little town and , the small towns. And all of a sudden we hear from the people, the Gentile people, the Germans are moving slowly. And then all of a sudden we see a German truck with soldiers and oh, my father said, we are already under the Germans. We caught from the Germans. We are going. My father was smart and took that horse and took some mud and smeared up the horse and made the wagon look like farmers and look not like Jewish people, because he hide the tallis that he had. We are going there and people are greeting us. People thought we are going from one , from one little 12 town to another little town. We are going back to where we go back to from there we went to . We saw where we came to before we go with the Russians and we saw the bombs. We didn't see the city. It was really wiped out. It was bombed. We didn't want to go but still some buildings were still remaining there, and then all of a sudden we come in on the highways where the German Army with this music with this big truck of ____ and tanks. And we are five going farther than them. We are going farther and they are going backwards. And they kept on saying in German , things like this. We knew how to speak <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> and they're running and the flowers they got for the Germans, and the womens get all kind of and they -- and then Partisans with rifles and knives came over to us, first with bicycle and come off the street because my father was making sort of like, sort of like . You should be too much with the hiding because the army is going there.</p><p>They stopped us and they said to him, where are you going? to my father, and my father said to him, oh, I know you. Because he spoke the language and they were drunk, really drunk and bloody, full blood like , you know. My father said to him, I know your father. Do you know? he said. He said, I have a little farm -- they were so drunk they didn't know what was going on. And they asked my father, did you see any Jews?</p><p>Jews? I saw so many Jews not too far, half a kilometer. Full of Jews. People with a lot of fences, sitting and telling a story. Oh, for this one, let's drink. In Lithuania, oh, this one let's, drink and, you know, opened up a bottle of some vodka. And my father was drinking and said to my brother and myself and to my mother, keep on moving, move, move, and he said keep on moving, to my brother, who was a little older. And my brother took the horse and started moving, and made 15 him to drink. And he drink a little bit. He had to take a sip and he said to them, take them . Keep on moving. Move away from the wagon we were maybe -- keep it moving so my brother was a little older and he took the horse and he keeps moving. They made him to drink a little bit, a sip, what it took, and he said to them, take them. My father says, keep moving with the wagon. We were maybe two or three foot away from him and then my father start running to him and he said oh, thank God. I get rid of them. Then we keep on going farther and we came into a little town. It was called -- this was already before we came, we passed the border because there were no border because the Germans already took over everything. They opened up all the borders. It was not Latvia. No one was guiding there. We came into the border there. Of course, we saw what was going on. We was scared. We saw dead people right and left, right and left. Jewish people and the Russian people were laying, slaughtered like so many pigs. First time I saw dead people and was the first time for me and of course, you see dead people more and more and more. We came to a little town called Milkinmeer(ph). It was not bombed. It was a nice little town. In fact, my uncle came from there. 16 There was . There was a house full. We went riding for -- like I say, the horse was and my father didn't want to ask for directions, and we <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> and there 17 was a gate like a door. You opened up and our house was in the back. The back was nice. There was a garden. My father was renting. This man was a he had a drug store. He built his house. It was a modern house and we lived in the back of the house, and before he was living on the property, not ours but there was a garden and took kind of some land and build a big house in front of this, in front the street, and we came to this to go into the gates. It was locked up. We couldn't go in. My father tried to open it up. It was locked. The people came to the window and we recognized they were neighbors. Why did you come here? You know. My father said I just came from traveling back from Latvia. How can you do this? Nobody's on the street. It's empty. Everybody is dead. Somebody came down and let us in the gate they close it right up and started telling us these stories. And all the neighbors, this street and this street. You could see to the window our street. This particular area they didn't make it here, they don't come here. They are still afraid they are going to come here. The house was empty. The house was still there. Nobody touched the house and of course, we run back to the house and the next we stayed overnight in our house. And all of sudden we hear 18 loudspeakers in this area and the streets were running full with Germans, you know, because when we came in it was so quiet. And there was loudspeakers and this where they are making the __ but my father was, of course, a little see what was going on. See if my mother's brother was there. He run away and escaped. They went to Russia. My father was going. I had my grandfather there and he was going to see his mother and father but he was still there, safe in the . It was next day they killed all the people in Latvia. You were safe from the it was next door they killed all the people. My grandmother, they hide her under the bed and they didn't find her. It was a little house, you know, they look and nobody was there. They didn't kill them this time but they get them anyway. They had loudspeakers in the area. We could hear it. It was in the area of the ghetto, but they took from all the Jews, and people start coming in the next day. My father go downtown to find out and I go with him. And the horses was so tired and couldn't go. We tried to give it a little bit water and it was walking. Was hard. Maybe going to take the horse and go we drive about ten blocks still Slobodka. We saw the -- we saw the little spitting on the Jew and doing -- all 19 the Germans, already the soldiers. It was not organized yet . All of a sudden we saw this, these uniforms.</p><p>They are talking, the Gestapo and the Nazi, and so the people start coming from downtown. In our area there was no gates or wire or nothing and my father was driving and he wanted to see my grandfather. The problem we wanted to see if the uncle was down in the city we. Drive for several blocks. We look where the used to <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> but not me. Our house was about 500 foot away from the next street it was . 20 There was the fire. Already it was a street, a main highway. It was like a connection they made. This was a big they made from the other side there was Jews too. They made wires between two streets and they made the bricks over to go where we shouldn't be. We have to build the ghetto ourself and then, of course, they get so organized. They came in with, like I say, the Germans. The Germans alone didn't have a part in the brutality because the and the Poles and the Latvia and have -- everybody was helping the Germans to kill the Jews. Like I saying, they were killing already but somehow we made it through the things. And of course, they putting everybody on the wires in this area and then they say five kilometers or ten kilometers and couldn't see on the map. I couldn't decipher it. Then they put in all the people from the sides and put the gates, they told us it was going to be a couple weeks before the ghetto was created. But I already had experience in Poland. Look like it. They, right away, they took the young people for work and my uncle, rest in peace, he was one, the first one. And he was taken right away from the ghetto, and the second they came in with trucks and wagons and made a liquidation. Young children and old people. They have a special area where they are 21 going to leave and, of course, they came in to my grandfather and grandmother and they put them right away on the truck, and some other people. And in fact, I was running to see my grandfather and when I get there, the Germans coming in and open up the wires in this area. They didn't go around. They came in and closed up again. When I see this area closing up with the rifle and the soldiers and the knives, then I turn back. I was afraid because I knew not to go there because I was born there. There was a Slobodka the Jewish people they were going to be . This was still in the <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> this time the make the Auschwitz. They start taking out people they had more room to release the prisoners. They came in and said there were too many people in your 23 house. It was going on like this for a little, a house we have plenty of room for them. It was going for a little while like this and then we are going to work. And I point out this thing that happened to me in the ghetto. In the beginning we had a cow and horse and when the ghetto start, there was a sign right away. Everything you possess you have to give it away. Of course, we had a horse andI had __ I have the . left them.</p><p>When I went when I left, when we were running away. The were still there and I thought maybe ten or fifteen . There came a family from the ghetto.</p><p>They run away from friends. They used to get it was not kosher, whatever. It was the -- they took the took the Germans you going to cook them and eat them. I said I didn't know what to do with the __. They took the horse. We had to give the horse.</p><p>My father hide it in the place where the horse was staying, and a couple weeks these loudspeakers come and everything you possess and everything you have from the living thing, even a chicken, even a fork, everything that alive you were not allowed to have.</p><p>My father had to give the horse to the Germans. We get shot if they catch us with it. One night I go with my father and there was a lot of places where 24 they had, farmer people used to come rest, and then there was a few places like this. There was a police there, I remember, when we had to take the police over there and there was German, the ghetto and everybody had cows and animal and things. I will tell you about a cow. They left a few cows in the ghetto for the milking. My father had to give up the horse. It was such a kind horse. He used to eat from the your hand. He was like a dog really, not a horse. The horse was so frightened that he start kick and had kicked up the German he almost kill him. He almost knocked down the German. He grabbed the gun against the horse, you know, and he grabbed the gun against my father and, did you tell him to do this? And my father said, I can talk to the horse. He touched the horse and looked him in the mouth and he said, this is a good horse. We ask to use it. Of course, they took it away and kick my father as a thank you and kick him away because my father was going to . It was on our street. This was the horse and when the ghetto start, they leave a few cows in the ghetto for the . This was supposed to be. They were nice in the beginning. Then one of the Jews -- the police came to our house and said you are going to feed the cow.</p><p>We take the cow from the house, from this house, 25 whatever -- was in the cows was standing, pull the cows out, not to far to the . I went to the cow and he <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0 tell you about this too, then I will tell you about the action. When they liquidated they took most of the people from the small ghetto and taking them to the Nitenfort(ph) taking them to the Nitenfort(ph), but before they did it 26 there was a hospital in this small ghetto. It was run by Jewish doctor and all kind of people that were capable to run a hospital. It was a regular hospital before. When our house was not too far away from the gates where they make, and then across the street there was a another ghetto and you can see in the back of our house a few blocks away, not in blocks. There was a then. <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 1 somehow he thought maybe he could make a move or something. The Germans said we should go to the right side or the left side, I don't know, but we followed my uncle and we went to the right side. We saw the people go to the left. They are treating them more awful then they are 29 treating us. On the right side we saw -- it was looser, the ghetto, more and the left was closer the other side. And he separate into thousand and thousand of people, and they open up the gates and put the people back in the clean ghetto, back where they burned the hospital. It was still there and they moved them in there. And it was deep in the night and everything starts falling to quiet, and they came to the right side and they said you can go if you have the houses where you live. Go back to your homes and we are still in the ghetto and they was pulling on the people in the left side, and stopping the soldiers, the Partisans. And like I say, the Lithuanians were maybe with the Germans and they put them in the other side, and we went back. Of course, in the panic and we missing -- my father is not here with my mother, and my father and my brother were lucky this time and we were pulled back to our home.</p><p>And like I say, we are not too far away from the smaller ghetto and other people going to houses here. The whole night screaming and panicking and so like in the morning, they opened up in the morning and they put them all in the line and put them in the Nitenfort.</p><p>There was house, I don't know the number, but it was, you couldn't see from one end to the 30 other, there was so many people. This was small babies and they did everything. This was a big action, they call it. It was big the action.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you know where they were going?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: We knew because, because we knew earlier because they killed our grandfather the Nitenfort and you were going out to work and this faction -- so telling us what happened to us. I didn't see good people. There was maybe a few. I didn't see a good German where I was, but I won't go into it, and they took these people and start them marching them to the Nitenfort, and we were still remaining in the ghetto. This was our luck, and in the morning the ghetto was completely empty, the small ghetto, and we could hear in the night the machine guns and the shooting, because the Nitenfort was not really far away from the ghetto. It was just really a couple kilometer up the hill. And sometimes playing, sometimes there I didn't know what was going to happen there, and you could see from the Nitenfort and see Slobodka. It was not so far away. And we could hear the shooting going on and the killing and, of course, nobody came back from there. And sometime we knew what was going on even before they are taking people in the Germany and the Austria and marching them between the two lines, two ghettos. 31 They were killing them over there too, and where were we going. We knew already. This night you don't tell people that they are going be killed. You couldn't make any move. If anybody move, your would lose you're life. And now I was walking down, and I liked to carve. Now, I was walking down, but I always like too carve and make airplanes and things like this.</p><p>One day in the ghetto time, I was already working on the airport and we were digging ditches and doing some other thing. They had a lot of prisoners. The Russians treat them terrible. Germans, they so do the prisoners was to us was you were <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 2 military they lost a little bit of faith, are we going to be alive. It was going on and when ditches -- going back to the ghetto -- I was not going to work. I was sitting outside and I was carving a little airplane and all of a sudden the Germans came in. They were free to go in their Jeeps and the Germans stopped. Four Germans walked to me and said to me</p><p> what are you doing there? I am playing. I am making myself a toy. How do you</p><p> know to make an airplane? You know, to me and I spoke, I think little and I spoke German in a way too because it was similar, so I told him I always 32 like to play. Do you have more knives? And I said, no, I have this one. No, I have this knife. And he said, you go to the Jeep, and I said, I want to tell my mother. And he kicked me and put me in the Jeep and I thought they were going to kill me, kill me. Downtown in the there isa school. People used to learn there. This was the headquarters for the Germans they put me in a basement and said to me, we aren't going to do nothing to you.</p><p>We want you to make airplanes for us. I didn't know what they wanted from me. I said, can you tell my parents? One of them okay, I'll tell them. My mother and father thought I was dead. Because my mother and father thought I was dead. They took me out and -- this was going on all the time. I was there maybe a couple of days. I don't know whether it was night or day because it was dark there, but it was light inside. And they bring me all kinds of tools and I made toys. I made a butterfly and an airplane and they keep on saying, keep on doing, keep on doing. I was a couple days and they took from everybody. I had a imagination and I always like to look at the airplanes, and when I was younger I dreamed of becoming pilot. Can you imagine me a pilot? But I had a dream.</p><p>Who knows, if the war wouldn't be there 33 or something. And I was doing these airplanes for them and I took maybe four or five models. They gave me soft wood.</p><p> I never worked with this. I tried to get out here and I even so I was doing. A few days went by and they came and said, oh, come on, you know, in German. I think they going to shoot me or something. They take me back to the same German that picked me up and, you know, drop me off at the gate and said go, go. They opened up the gate and it was also the Jewish Police guard, and what happened to you? They took me there and I was making the airplanes. I went in by foot not too far away from the grates where you go in into main gates to go in when you get out from the ghetto. Of course, my mother and my father was working there and they thought I was dead. And then life still was going the same system like it was and the next day I had to go to work.</p><p>When there in the ghetto a certain time, not all the time in the ghetto, and then all of sudden somebody came to the building.

There was not a day I was not afraid for my life. I came back to the and beginning. Like I mentioned in the beginning, in our house came a family from France, and they were eating the rabbits. But there was a boy. He was very intelligent, young man, my age, and they are burning our place and we were leaving. Like I say they burning some wood for the ghetto to bring, you know, to burn for the, for the office and things like this. They also used to bring boxes from the military for wood for kindling lighting. In the boxes they had a lot of screws and nails and things like this, and this boy was also 40 going to work. It was Sunday and I didn't go to work and this boy said, I have a trick to make and, I said, fine. He said, let's take two of the bulbs and take two screws put them together and put inside some and you see it will like explode.</p><p>This was in the ghetto time. We are going back to the ghetto.

When I was swinging this string with this wire knot it exploded, but it gave such a shot that we were not too far away from the gate and from the and the Germans were guarding. And like I say, they were on the other side and from nowheres we get such a shot and the smoke came out and I didn't know what happened to me. And there was completely exploded and the knot was going, and I see the wire in my hand, and it took me three 41 seconds, five seconds, ten seconds. Missiles were coming from out of the other side from the ghetto, and they cut the wire and came in right away from the army. I don't know where they came and they surrounded the whole area and said who shot? And what happened, this piece of wire, this piece of metal fly so far and hit one the soldiers in the helmet. And I didn't know what happened. And they said who shot all they came in to our place where we were living and took everybody out the houses. And those people are going to work some.

And he was so uniform -- he was not in SS. he was from the Wehrmacht, from the soldier, and then ghetto. I look like his brother and he was on duty and he was guiding the people. They were walking and every group had a soldier to watch them, and everyone had a Meister soldier to watch them and there was a Meister, the people that give you the orders to every day. I have duty. I will give you a leave it and you pick it up, and this can't be a German. Was a good person, a good man but this was one was going on for a while and then one day raid and this time we were walking there, and it was also full of the bunker they are building. A little farther away was like wood and one of us was going to the truck and it was muddy and you go in muck. And I sat in this area I looked for my father all the time and my brother. And every time I had something in my pocket and bring it to them and they were working in this area, and so bring it to them because they were working in this area. The guard was standing farther away a 80 few other with work other sections. Block number five, six, seven, eight and there were</p><p> another blocks to make. There was were a few other to make ten, nine, whatever and there more barracks on the other side. Then I happened to be there in that area and all ofa sudden the the raid was there and everybody had to lay. This good German was <span class="page-break" number="25"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 2 later. I was supposed to come again because it was maybe going on for a month or something. Everything time there a piece of bread, whatever, cheese. The next day I was afraid to go over and pick it up, but I felt I was not I was a young fellow. I didn't have had no, couldn't say. I was an intelligent person, so many schools and years, 82 but I learned to be a human being before the war start. Wait a second. If I am not going to go to him he might shoot me or whatever, might shoot. And I had the going on -- he was never there. When I put the wood and some of the __ said if I met him, you know, I play dumb. Why? Should I? You, this swine is this pig. You know, he could kill us. All because of him we be bumped from the Americans two mile in the air. There were you put up aluminium foil against raid. And anyway, I lost me a couple days but he was</p><p> I was going a couple days and -- army we used to keep the solders not too often.</p><p>There was a couple and they was going and then this from there. Then I had the experience they used to come in the camp and they putting the woman to works in the area and in our camp. They want the woman for the other camp and they were working the kitchens there and cleaning for the soldiers and also working other places. The older lady with no hair look like boy and uniforms, and they used to make get a shower. Once in a while they build a nice -- it was a barrack but it was better than the first one. And they had a little corridor and they were so even in a working camp. They put in the people in the shower and most of them then we were all men and some men had a 83 desire, and they put a woman undressed, completely naked and she would going and maneuver the water to make the water, to turn on the water. And there I was afraid. I was alive but some people were still in the -- men have a desire for a woman. You could see in the part, and have a desire and they would come in with a raincoat and came in with a stick and right, smacking the people on the part, and it was painful and some of them died. Some of them pulled them out dead. Until they found out this the Jewish man was the leader. Some of them not coming to work they kill about 155 people that I remember. They thought this was none.</p></p></dialogue>

I think, I think, the make is different but we all the same people. And then he said to me and this barrack this man that was involved with the for the work. He said that we should work three shifts. We should work eight hours and constantly working over there, day or night and sometimes in the day shift and sometimes in the middle shift, and sometimes I was in the night shift and the work after the job, and one -- it was a Sunday this time -- and I came from the night shift, come in the day shift, you know, to switch around. And I was another time I used to go away he said to me always, he called me Israel will you put this 85 away? And I dug out with my hand a little hole and I keep this tied together and put it in a little straw until -- it was my -- I didn't care. Respect was having. Didn't bother me.

It was like cold. We were there. It was raining and wet snow and it was really snowing, and we walked out with this. I could hear scream and halt, halt, halt, because he was Close, but I didn't -- stop, stop, stop. Anyway, we heard scream and we hear shooting and, of course, there was a little window to look out and we keep going to the ditch to the window. There was this priest and the Germans and the soldiers around the camp, and there was the like they were 86 watching like in a prison and they told him to stop, stop. And going out for the soldiers they could go in the camp for a second. There were doors. They could open form them. For us they couldn't. And they walked in and he said he said, he made a noise. It was so quiet this time.

And there was a tall man. He was a tall man. My brother was compared to the men, he was not so tall. We would not survive if we were little bit. He was shorter than the other guy and this guy was maybe 6'2" and my brother was 5'8" and lucky because this was survival, because we were not too little. And he went out to get the soup for the men to eat, and it was snowing and the weather was damp and wet and there was tracks going in from the trains where they were working. I -- it's hard to make a picture, what was going on. 88 Unbelievable things. Barracks with machine and all kind of machinery was standing there, and you had to go to a factory.</p><p>There was building with a big thing, and my brother went to the kitchen like it and I was there walking around, not too far away, because there was the oven, the wood to put in the for soldiers, because they were guarding them, and I saw my brother going. I was happy he got -- at least he have an easier job then. I was working hard too. The coals were so heavy I thought I'd die. I couldn't pick it up sometimes. I was afraid not enough coals, afraid not enough coal, and a few times the Germans said there was what you are taking and smack a kick and all this stuff. They were not so gentle to me. I got beat up more than one time. I took it, with somebody on your back all the time. And my brother walked over to the -- not to too far away from the place that have to bring the soup. It was a canister and it was wintertime and it was snowing. It was wet and this can slided, and he was short and it slide right on him, and the can kicked him over.

You could see on his face. Maybe he was wounded or something in Auschwitz and the Auschwitz looked like it was liquidated. It was before they put him in our camp and when I was -- I was to make warm for him. One time he said I should take his plate and it wash out and cook him some soup. it was like a soup the soldiers had. I go outside. There was a train.

This was after Dachau it was after liberation and I was living there and the mountains we came out there. The people are dying like flies, like a lot of people weren't making it. If you walk a little out of the line the dog will grab you and bites you. You can't escape. I had wooden shoes, wooden shoes and I lost my shoe. I was running barefoot and it was April.

And all thought was burning and machine guns and military going. And anyway, there was a dead horse -- but I can tell stories. People were so hungry they were eating the dead horse. I didn't eat the dead horse. And we were walking into this little town and the Germans were there in the small town and we walked in. And everybody, you go here, and they go there, here, sort of like in the like they have it in the 98 farms, little town. And there was boys in this house and things like this, and the woman was watching the house and sitting. She offer us to -- she don't know -- for us to eat or something. But they were afraid.
