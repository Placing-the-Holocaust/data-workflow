And as I said in our introduction that was not on tape, what we'd like to do is start at the very beginning. Where were you born; did you have siblings; what was your family circumstances -- what were your family circumstances; who were your mother and father?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Fine.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So maybe we could start there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My -- my name is Joachim Baer. I was born in Hamburg in December 20, 1929. I have a sister who is about four years older than I am. My father was a physician, he was a Zionist, and he didn't look Jewish. And he had good pair -- relation with patient. Interesting enough, my -- the patient always talked to the -- to the -- the doctors, and they told my father that Hitler is building tanks and preparing  <span class="page-break" number="0"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Joachim Baer , March 1, 2010 for war.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And that was the atmosphere that time. And interesting enough, my w -- my wi-- my mother was afraid to go to Palestine, that was like a desert land. And in 1933 they took a ship and went to Palestine to see if you can live there. And then he saw that's not so terrible, and that's when he start making preparation. But the t-turning point was that one day, I believe in 1935, Hitler decided Jewish phi-physician cannot have any more non-Jewish patient. And my father was a doctor like [indecipherable] where he lost a lot of his business. So that was a turning point, and he say, it's time to go.</p></p></dialogue>
