And then he saw that's not so terrible, and that's when he start making preparation. But the t-turning point was that one day, I believe in 1935, Hitler decided Jewish phi-physician cannot have any more non-Jewish patient. And my father was a doctor like [indecipherable] where he lost a lot of his business. So that was a turning point, and he say, it's time to go.</p></p></dialogue>
