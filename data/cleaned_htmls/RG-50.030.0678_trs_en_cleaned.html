<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: This is United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Mr.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>Raymond Turgel conducted on November 8, 2012 in Potomac, Maryland. My name is Inna Novoselskis (ph) and I want to start out by thanking you, Mr. Turgel, for agreeing to meet with us today.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You're most welcome.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: To talk about your experiences, to talk about the way that the Holocaust impacted your life, and as we do with all of our interviews, we'll start at the beginning. We'd like to know a little bit more about you, your background, your family. So let's start off with the simplest of questions. Where were you born, when were you born and who were your parents?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="0"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was born on February 28, 1924 in Berlin and in a second floor walk-up apartment on Potsdamer Strasse, which is near the center or close to the center of the town. Both my parents were medical doctors. My father was practicing and my mother was a psychiatrist and we lived in that same house, same apartment, until we left Berlin, except for, I think, one week after the Kristallnacht where we heard some rumors that the Gestapo was coming and looking for people, so we moved to my grandmother's apartment, which was in West Berlin, in a different area which just temporarily.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Just temporarily, and then you came back?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I'm not -- not quite sure because I left in 1938 on the kindertransport.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: We'll get to that point.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: We'll get to that point.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Let's still stay in the 1920s, the early 1920s. You said that both of your parents were physicians.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes, my father--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: That's quite impressive.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My father practiced -- had his practice right in the apartment.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: He was a GP?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: uhu.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, actually he was a orthopedic surgeon, but for--for--to make a living he--he was a GP because it was more difficult to get working in the hospital, even at that time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And that would have been because of what reasons?</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I'm not sure. I'm not sure, but I know that he had a sign outside the building that said praktischer Arzt, which means GP, and that's all. You know, I was, all after, very little so I didn't--I did not know about all the various complications that come in to being.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you have brothers and sisters?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You were the only child.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was the only child, yes. My mother's health wasn't that great. After I was born she had pleurisy and some other -- and she was not able, I think, to have another child.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: What would you say would be your earliest memory?</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: My earliest memory, the apartment had fairly large rooms, was a peculiar long shape. You had to go through the dining room to go into the rest of the apartment, and my earliest I had my crib was in my parents bedroom but the bedroom was very large. There was not only the beds and wardrobe, since they didn't have closets, and a large table like a dining room table. My crib was on the other side of that so it was a large room, but I was standing up in the crib and looking at the rest of the world. Ha-ha.</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, ha-ha. Did you have -- after your mother had you, and you say she -- she was a bit sickly, did she still practice?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, she had a few patients, but not have many. Not -- my father was busy every day of course but no, she didn't have too--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Too many.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Too many, no. But at age, I think, five they hired a French governess for me so she was free to do things without having to supervise me all the time. We also had a live-in maid that cleaned -- my mother liked to cook, but not to clean up, so.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: There are people who --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Ha-ha.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- that don't like those things ha-ha. How would you describe your parents as individuals? What kind of personalities did they have?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I think they were fairly easy going. Occasionally they'd some -- my parents had some loud disputes, but not too often, ha-ha. But I think from a -- we had -- they had a large number of friends and I think my father was a very good host and he was liked.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was he an extrovert?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, sort of. Not -- not, you know, the bravado kind, but he was pleasant to be with, you know, respected others and.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And your mom?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: She was shyer. She was shy in many ways and a little more quiet perhaps.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Who were you closer to?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My dad.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="2"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you have shared interests? Were there things that you felt comfortable talking to him about, you know, ways that you were together?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, here's the thing. My dad, in his spare time, used to do all kinds of small repairs and he actually made a lot of toys for me. I had an electric train set when I was a little older and he built a whole station with the baggage lifts and all kinds of --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Cool.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- complicated things, so of course you know--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Oh cool, that's so nice.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. The set actually all together was so large that I could only use it on weekends because it went from one room to the next, ha-ha, ha-ha.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh God what train set delight, to have it through the whole apartment.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's quite a gift.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You know, because it's not that a kid gets a gift it's--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Actually the way the apartment was arranged you came in from the front stairs into what was the waiting room for the patients and the front three rooms, one was my father's office, the one next to it was the examination room which was not too large, and next to that was the living room/sitting room, whatever you want to call it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>And when we had guests there were two curtains drawn between my father's office and the other rooms so you didn't see all those medical instruments and things. You just walked through from one room to the other, and the sitting room had a baby grand, and a fireplace which was unusual for--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: That's right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- that kind of set up, but during -- unless we had guests we don't -- or I was practicing the piano ha-ha, we didn't use that room very much.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Who was the player, the piano player in the family?</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, my dad played without lessons by ear and I took lessons until age 12, 11, 12.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you like it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I did, yes. I did. My mother played violin, but I never remember hearing her play. I know she had one, but I don't have a vivid memory of that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, I'll confess to you when I was little my parents also gave me piano lessons and I was the world's worst student. My teacher was a composer who was a refugee and he was reduced to giving piano lessons to kids who didn't practice.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Ha-ha. No, I actually practiced and I liked it, ha-ha, but I probably -- I wasn't, you know, wunderkind talent, something like that. I had to do my scales and things and -- but after age 12 there was just not, not time and opportunity to do that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Let's--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Now let me add one thing.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: The front of the apartment looked out on Potsdamer Strasse and was diagonally opposite the sports palace where Hitler had all his speeches so I was many times at the window looking down seeing Hitler coming down the center of the street in his open Mercedes and saluting the lines of the SR men either side, forming a guard for him.</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And do you remember how old you were? Was this before "33 or after "33?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: After, after "33.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: After "33.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Before 33 he was not, not in power so he wasn't able to do this. Also, in the ground floor of the building there were -- it was customary in European cities there were stores and one happened to be a beer hall and that was not the best because when I slept at night I could hear them sing songs like "Jewish blood spurts from the knife, life is twice as good." Ha-ha, that was my--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Your lullaby.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Cradle song, yeah. Ha-ha.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Ha-ha. Oh my gosh. What an atmosphere. What an atmosphere.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah that was not good.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was the neighborhood Jewish?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No. It was -- was it mixed? Was it was it sort of like?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="4"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: The way an urban place could be?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Who were your neighbors? Did you know them?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. I don't even know the people who lived on the same -- there were two apartments on each floor. I don't even know the people who lived in the other.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Apartment.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were there other doctors nearby?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. Well, nearby, within a few blocks perhaps, yes. And one of my school friend's father was a dentist and that's the dentist I visited. He lived two blocks away, something like that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, were there other Jewish shops on your street?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not that I know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So there wasn't really much interaction with the others who would be your neighbors?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No playing with the kids or anything?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not the neighbors, no. The only people I played with were people my parents knew.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So how would you describe your parents" social circle? Who were the folks who were their friends, their acquaintances?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, one of them is if you turn around, the painter that's Erich Wolfsfeld. He was one of the friends and he painted.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Wolfsfeld, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He moved to England later in, I think "37 also.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: This looks like graphic?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It's a lovely picture. Is it a self portrait?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="5"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, that's a self portrait.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Erich Wolfsfeld.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And this was given to your parents in 1945 it says, 4-45?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes. He moved to England when my parents were living there too and we -- that's over the mantle piece, that's--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: That's also his?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh. So -- and he was in your family circle?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You remember him as a child?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yes, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you go visit him in the studio?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, in fact I have a picture in the next room. He painted one of my dad and one of me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, really.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. I don't know where he lived really.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Okay. This one, you know, has a look that I've seen in Keta Kovitz's (ph) sometimes. It's not the same kind of art, but the human expression.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, he was a professor at the academy, so before Hitler.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Before Hitler.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And, of course, he had to leave.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah. Tell me more about the, you know, the people who would come to visit and, you know, as guests.</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, friends, other doctors who lived in different parts of the  <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> </p></p></dialogue>

Well, you know, the way they used to entertain in the--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah. Well, that's another doctor. They lived in different part and of course all the different doctors, the doctors knew each other from university I guess, and so we--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I don't hear you mention though any relatives, like aunts and uncles and things--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I did have -- I -- my grandmother, my maternal grandmother. I never really remember my paternal grandmother. | think they died either when I was very young or before I was born. I just know their names and I've seen their photographs, but I don't know. But my maternal grandmother, her husband also was a physician, a well known one and--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: What was his name?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Max Lerventau.(ph)</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In fact, the picture in the hall as you came in here, you might not have noticed, that was my great-grandmother.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes, I did notice it. I did notice it.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And this was on your mother's side?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. My father, my father moved to Berlin or his family moved to Berlin when he was three years old so I don't know any other relatives from there, other than he has a sister who also lived in Berlin and my cousin who was nine years older -- well, actually there were two cousins. She had a son and a daughter and my -- the son was nine older than I was and then the daughter was 18 years older than I was so I didn't have much social contact with them other than at family reunion. They were out of my age range, so to speak. Yes, oh yes, my uncle who left -- my uncle had real estate, owned real estate in Berlin and one of his tenants was the Nazi party. That was before 1933, and they didn't</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="7"></span>  pay their rents so he sued them so when Hitler came to power, he moved to Paris within weeks, you know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Didn't collect the rent, ha-ha?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Didn't collect the rent, no. Incidentally, his wife was an artist and she made this -- this -- these tiles, this tile table.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How lovely that you have so many mementos and, you know, things that surround you in life that really come from that time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: This actually is in both ways because my dad made the table and my aunt made the tiles.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Wow. He really had a talent for -- I wonder did he also enjoy it? Was it--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh, yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You know--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: He liked to do things, yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It's a lovely table. I describe it -- is it cast iron here or wrought iron?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah. This is wrought iron. That's a good frame.</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: A dark brown wrought iron table with a lot of design elements to it with colorful painted glass tiles as the table top with figures of young girls and in a background that has a forest and these are -- these look like black either puppies or sheep or?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't know what they are.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah, but they're very pretty and dainty and--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Graceful looking. Would you say that your home was a quiet place or a very lively place as you were growing up?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, fairly quiet.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: uhu.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: In terms of you mean noise or?</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: The people coming in and out.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, of course.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And always being full of--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, the patients came in.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And, you know, they're waiting room was right adjacent to the dining room so I could hear.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you ever know any of the patients?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: There was a real -- there was a real separation between--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, they were local, you know. People didn't come from afar, they didn't drive to go to the doctor, they walked, and so they were from the neighboring five or six blocks or something like that and there were mainly working people.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was -- did you know any people who were non-Jewish, gentile Germans? Were they part of the social circle?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Social circle? I don't ... 1 can't remember, really. Mainly the -- the people I -- by the time I had sort of socializing -- Hitler was in power and non-Jews were out of the question at that point because they wouldn't come to a Jewish home.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And before that I think the social circle was just family and friends that my parents knew.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Where did you go to school?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, now that's interesting. The first school I went to was a Montessori's school and that was for the first three years I guess, and I had to take the -- the subway to go there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Which stop to which stop?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: From Bulow Strasse.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Bulow Strasse.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: To Friesen Strasse.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I remember Friesen Strasse.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [had to change trains actually.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And the Montessori school was on Friesen Strasse?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. Close to it, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Close to it, and you were how old?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Six when I started.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="9"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Can you imagine today letting a six-year-old go to -- yeah, walk to school? Ha-ha.</p><p>Did you like it--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- from what you remembered?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. Yes, I did like it and there was only one teacher and one I think occasionally one assistant, but the mixed grades is in Montessori and you usually do your own thing and I was very proud. I learned how to calculate a square root because they do it on a board with little, little pellets, you know; a board that has little holes in it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, yeah, pegs.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Graphically.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's an accomplishment.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Ha-ha</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Because I couldn't do it even in high school, ha-ha, ha-ha.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Ha-ha.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: It could have been a premonition of a future career.</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah. Well, actually speaking of this, I -- in subsequent schooling I went to the Jewish school which was on the Kaiserdomm.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: uhu.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And there too I had to travel and then last one was in Klopstock Strasse.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Klopstock Strasse. Yeah, I do recall that street.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah and -- but I was always interested in mathematics. In fact, I bought books to learn how to do calculous before they taught it in the school, ha-ha.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You know, your schooling then starts -- well, I would assume if at six years old that's 1930 and--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: uhu.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And politics and what's happening in Germany is becoming more and more and more tense. How did you feel?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>I mean, did you feel that as a young child?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did it impact your home life? How did it go from beyond the curtain and up from the bierstube into the house?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, that was after, after "33. From "34, that's really became tense and before that I once witnessed -- there was also a small park across and there was a fight between -- it was later explained to me -- communists and Nazis. They went at each other with clubs and stuff like that in the park.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And that was before "33?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was before "33, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And did you witness that from the window?</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I think I might have been in the park with the governess.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What did they look like?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Huh?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember what they looked like? Was it a big group? Was it young kids?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no. There were, I would say, people in their twenties and thirties, something like that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And were they men?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. No women?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no. Woman did not figure in the social life of how they work, working life.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did you become aware of what was going on in the larger society? I mean, you're a child. Did your parents try and shield you or did they talk to you? Did others talk to you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, certainly when -- when Hitler came to power you could read it in the newspapers and all the brown shirts and people with arm bands with the swastika on it, and as I said, I got it firsthand.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: From the bierstube?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah, not only from the bierstube, but looking down at Hitler driving up in his car.</p><p>To this day I will never buy a Mercedes.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="11"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But you were a nine-year-old boy so how did you know to be -- I mean, certainly from what do you remember from it?</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not too much at first until you saw all the Hitler youth coming around and they were sort of ruffians.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did they pick on you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. Iwas never picked on fortunately.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did they pick on other people that you knew or--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- others in the street?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I didn't witness any particular ones but they -- they did pick on some people and certainly in -- later on in Kristallnacht I went to school that day and I was late, you know, leaving late but then the school was closed so I went back home again and everything was -- windows were broken on all kinds of stores.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: On the way home?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: On the way home, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And what about if your father had a sign out in front, you know, on Potsdamer Strasse and he was a praktischer Arzt, so anything happened to his practice, his office?</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, not until -- I'm not quite sure if that was "37 or so that the non-Jews were not allowed to go to Jewish doctors, but the name did not signal, you know -- if anybody walked in they wouldn't know from the name, like my Grandfather Lowenthaul, they wouldn't know that he was Jewish, but Turgel or Torgal, (ph) that doesn't, that doesn't--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Where does the name come from?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I think I mentioned to you on the phone I believe it comes from a little town near Walnius (ph), that's Torgelow.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Torgelow, yeah. So that's where your father's family would be from?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Originally, but my father I think was born in Vellna.</p><p>(ph)</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Aha, okay.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So at least he said, but it may have been, you know, his parents but I don't -- as I said, I really do not remember my paternal grandparents at all.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you see a drop off in the number of patients that were in the room?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="12"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, they suddenly ceased to come altogether and I think he closed down his practice.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: After 1933 did your parents demeanor change?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. Well, I think we went to synagog more often.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I forgot to ask this earlier.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you a religious family?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no, not -- not -- not really. We never kept a kosher household and they went to high holidays perhaps, but not on sabbath or time like this, but after Hitler came there was more, especially on Friday nights my -- my mother went to various synagogs and the way the synagogs were arranged in Berlin, the Jewish community operated all of them and they were paid for by tax, the church tax, the ten percent church tax and the Jewish taxpayers that went to the Jewish community so you didn't have to belong to a particular synagog, you can go to any one of them. In fact, they -- the rabbis rotated sometimes from one place to another.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, were there these distinctions as there are here with reform?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- Oh, yes, yes. Well, there was just -- I guess it's reform or so the of reform and the orthodox were separate. I never went to an orthodox synagog.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was the synagog far from your home?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, the one we went to most of the time was in Fasanenstrasse, that was quite far.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, occasionally there was some others we went to, Friedenstempel. I don't know exactly where it was, but it was walking -- not quite walking distance.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did your parents have a car?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, but not until about "35 or "36, something. My dad bought a little Fiat, but before that no, and the house calls my father did were all in the neighborhood so a car wouldn't have been any good.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Excuse me. The house calls were all in the neighborhood, yeah?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah, so it was walking distance for him.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="13"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: How did the relations change or did they change with your governess and your maid?</p><p>I would assume they weren't Jewish?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. Well, the governess was French.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Aha.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: One was French. The next one was from Switzerland from the French part of Switzerland and that was -- well, I was five so that was "29, yeah. That was before.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did she teach you French?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I'm still fairly fluent. Not as fluent as I was, but still good enough.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And your language at home? I assume your parents and you spoke in German?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Did they know Yiddish?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Only a few expressions, but it's difficult to speak Yiddish and German at the same time because of the similarities. You go from one to the other and you don't know it, but you know a few terms for which there are no, no equivalents. The one thing that always amused me is that even the -- the Hitler people used a Jewish term which they got from the underworld and that is to stand guard, snearl (ph) stehen.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: snearl (ph) stehen?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: From shomer, to guard, in Hebrew.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And they never knew it, huh?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I'm sure the Germans didn't know that, but that meant, you know, the look-out post there, ha-ha.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Ha-ha.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Ha-ha.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So you say your parents" demeanor didn't change but their lives did and their--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, their lives did, yes. Instead of going on vacation to the North Sea where my aunt had a house or a little bed and breakfast type of place, we went to Switzerland in northern Italy just to get out of Germany.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> <span class="page-break" number="14"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. To get some reprieve.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. Except it eased up in 1936 because of the Olympics. All the antisemitic signs disappeared.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yes, and my dad and I got tickets for the olympic games and saw Jesse Owens win his 100 meter run.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No kidding?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Ha-ha.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Now I'm -- in my mind--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: From my time in Berlin there was a very well-known stadium, Olympiastadion, I think it's in the western, northwest part of the city.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Is that where you went to have the games?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But the Sportpalast is somewhere else?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was in Potsdamer Strasse and that was used for bicycle racing and boxing and stuff like that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Not for--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Was it an enclosed area?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. It was like the Verizon Center here or something. Not quite as big perhaps. I don't know. I was never in it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You were just across the street from it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, ha-ha.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah, ha-ha. Didn't want to attend those rallies?</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, I didn't, and boxing matches weren't my thing either, ha-ha.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah. So did your parents talk to you about their worries or did they try to keep those things from you?</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I think they did after I was, you know, in my teens certainly.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> <span class="page-break" number="15"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, but after 1933, when you were still a nine-year-old boy, you don't remember anything about that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, it sort of came on gradually.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Now, [had some cousins. My mother's sister was married to a man who operated a supermarket, a chain of supermarkets in Berlin and they had a house out in the east of Berlin near Finsterwalde and driving there later on they had in the square of the village there was a big elaborately carved sign saying "Jews not wanted here" but, you know, the big thing was the carving and painted and somebody really spent a lot of time doing this, but that was the sign that was in there. But they had a house on a lake and a housekeeper who lived in the basement of that. I spent a lot of weekends there sometimes, after my dad had a car, because we couldn't get there without a car.</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Talk a little bit, if you can about, you know--I'm trying to take things up to 1936, 1937, and so when you're older then you're already an adolescent, maybe 12, 13 years old, did you have close friends at that age?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, from school.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: From school.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: From the Jewish school that you went to.</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes, yes. Except the other one was the son of the dentist who lived nearby.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Because he was close always because it was walking distance, I mean, five, ten minutes, something like that.</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And did you share what was going on in your lives and what was, you know, what you were seeing in the streets and on the newspapers?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I can't really recall that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was there talk of what to do?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, yes there were talk about emigrating to then Palestine and, in fact, I learned in the Kaiser's school and the Kaiserdom, I learned to conversational Hebrew, you know, not the religious study Hebrew. I really never had a separate course in biblical Hebrew, whatever you want to call it, but I learned Hebrew like a foreign language, conjugation, nouns and verbs, and all this kind of stuff.</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So as a young boy you spoke German, French, Hebrew and a little bit of Yiddish?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, just a few.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="16"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Just a few words.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Just a few words like tinnif and well, halosis (ph) ha-ha.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What did I want to ask now? I'm going to go back a little bit.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Would you describe your family life as a happy life, as--you did say it's quiet, home was quiet. Would you say it was a warm atmosphere? Would you say it was a place of safety? How did you feel when you were at home?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh, I--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Or were you lonely?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Huh?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Or were you a lonely boy?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, reserved, yes but not lonely, no. I did have people to--to come and visit and play, play with me, especially with the train set and that, ha-ha.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, yeah. That would make it, ha-ha.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Ha-ha, ha-ha.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Ha-ha. But was it a place of warmth?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yes. Yes, definitely, and I never felt desperate or anything like that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you ever feel unsafe?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, not directly threatened, but indirectly, knowing what was going on, but it was still safe to walk on the street. At least I was never in any situation on the street where I was being harassed by anyone. Maybe I didn't look Jewish enough.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Well, that could be. That could be, you know. Take us up to the time--explain a little bit from your school days, from your parent's conversations, from how things developed that you--and please bring in more, if you can, detail about Kristallnacht that brings us up to the time when you're going to leave on a kindertransport. I'd like to--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, that's--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How things developed.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That decision was done by my parents without my--any input from me obviously because, you know, they decided that was a big sacrifice for them because they didn't know whether they'd ever see me again. I--I remember on the station, you know, waving</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="17"></span>  out of the window and seeing two sad people receding into the background, but we did-- as I said, we did, for a time anyway, move to my grandmother's apartment and I remember one little detail. We took a taxi and I said to my dad, let's take a taxi to the train station and bahnhof so and get into another taxi so the taxi driver can't tell where we went. That was--they followed my advice on that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It makes sense, it makes sense.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Because you go to the station, that's a legitimate taxi ride and coming back--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: From the station--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: You take another taxi from the station and you go to Vitschlob (ph)Strasse and where my grandmother lived.</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: We'll get to the part where, you know, you leave and you meet your parents. I want to record all that, but what happened to this larger family, your grandmother and some of the--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well-- Q --other people?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, my--my cousins--as I said, my cousin's father was in the grocery business and he had connection with Swedish companies, so he managed to get money out fairly easily because--and they moved first to Sweden, then to Israel and then--well, then my--my uncle died and his wife and the children moved to Israel and then moved back to England.

<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="18"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. We shopped locally within walking distance because we didn't have a car, no. So it was about less than ten-minute walk to the marketplace and five minutes to the delicatessen store and meat market. The dairy market was, you know--milk was bought not in bottles but you brought your own.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Own?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Your own container and they sort of very unhygenically took a big jar and dug it into a vat of milk and then poured it into your jar, ha-ha.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. I remember seeing that--not in Berlin but that kind of distribution.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Excuse me. Can we pause for a minute? You were going to say something?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes. In the--we went to my grandmother on Friday night, usually the whole family, including my father's sister and her husband who was Polish and lived with my grandmother after my grandfather died, and they always had a big meal. I remember a large menu that was, you know, soup, fish and meat and then two desserts which I was waiting for ha-ha, and that took place almost every Friday in my grandmother's apartment. That was sort of a--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Tradition?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Tradition, yes. And other holidays we spent with my cousins. They had a house, you know, where the knee was in Berlin?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It's like having a brownstone in New York City, not everybody can.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And when you--okay, so let's--let's go back to Kristallnacht. You go to school, school is closed?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I went back again and I saw all kinds of crowds out and broken windows and graffiti on other things, so went straight home.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did you--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Took me a while.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you ever hear antisemitic comments from people on the street? Let's say your grocer or?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, not--not--not from the grocers, but from the people in the beer hall, ha-ha.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, yeah, but aside from that would you ever--did attitude, you know--did the experience change?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not really to my face, no. I mean, the newspapers yes, of course, the Sturmer, the Goebbels and diatribes on there, but.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you have a radio at home?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did you--did your parents listen to it because clearly they would only have been German broadcasts?</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes, but you could get short waive, you could get other--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, oh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You know, you could get other stations too, but they didn't--they spoke some French but not English, but my mother's brother was an engineer and he was, of course, able to do all of these things, but he left for Spain and unfortunately he was killed in the Franco war.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was he a soldier? Did he fight in it or was he in crossfire somehow?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't really know the details. I never knew. But I know that he died. Whether it was of wounds or of illness or combination of the two, I really don't know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When your parents told you that you are going to go on the kindertransport.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="20"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you surprised?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I don't know, but I can't quite recall my immediate reaction was, but I heard of others having gone on it and they said that they had made some arrangements. I don't know how they made the arrangements either, but they must--they knew some people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Had you studied any English by then?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, yes. I did--we did have an American student who gave me some English lessons using the Saturday Evening Post as a text book, ha-ha.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It's not a bad way to learn, ha-ha.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, because it has colloquial--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's right.</p><p>A --English in it rather than literature, which is not quite appropriate.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. You can't quote Shakespeare going to buy milk.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So I knew of--I knew some but my English wasn't good. That's when I got to England I was sent to a school which was for students younger than us.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Let's go back then.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You're in the train station. Did you realize you may not see your parents again?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, of course I did because I knew the train was one way and I wouldn't come back the next day, and I did not know what arrangements--they were trying to get out but they- -my father made an application for an American visa but because at the time he was born Vilna was Polish, he was of the Polish quota which was always filled so he could not get a visa.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And your mother?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, that doesn't matter.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It doesn't matter.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="21"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My mother was born in Berlin so.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But she wouldn't have been able, as a German citizen, be able to bring him out.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: On her--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Do you remember anything of the train ride?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not much, no.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What would be your first memories then of when you land in England, what did you find? What did you see?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I was, of course, anxious whether somebody was going to meet me, you know, because you're in a foreign country, the language you don't quite understand and--but the headmaster of the school met me and drove me to the school which was in north of London between Enfield and Potters Bar on the ridgeway and it was a boarding school so I didn't feel that I was separate from the other kids who were also not with their parents.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you know how it came to be that you were sent to a boarding school rather than taken in by a family?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I don't. But the arrangement--I don't know anything about the arrangement my parents made, either for the kindertransport or for my schooling in England. I don't know where the money came from or what the connections were.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Let's go forward. So tell us about the school. What were your impressions of the school?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, the school was quite different from what I was used to. There was one other German refugee boy there and we got along fairly well I think, but I had to do a lot of catching up in terms of how school was conducted, homework, and English of course was the big big problem but I did pretty well, I think. By the time the summer vacations came along I was quite comfortable there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So after one full--almost a full school year if it was November?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="22"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, no. Well, one term because--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay. Okay, so it's not--it was November to May or November to April, something--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well two terms actually, yeah. Well, I got there in October or something and--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: The year ends in June or so and then in June I traveled to North Wales to stay with friends of the family I never heard of, but they somehow--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Were friends of the family?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, they put me up for a couple of weeks and I enjoyed going to the beach in North Wales in Llandudno.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Llandudno.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Llandudno.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It must be like this long.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, it's double L. It's L-l, double L, that was the beach town. They actually lived in Coburn Bay, which is easier to pronounce, ha-ha.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And so did you spend a few weeks there or the summer there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, just--just part of the summer. Then I traveled to Paris because I had heard that my parents were managed to get a flight booked out of Berlin.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So here's a question I had. Did you have regular correspondence with them when you were in the school or no?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think I had correspondence, but I'm not sure. I'm not sure.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I couldn't--I'm sure that they could write letters at that point, but then yes, I must have had because they told me to go to Colwyn Bay and I wouldn't have known about that and then to--I guess even the phone conversation to go to Paris, so I managed to buy a ticket and go to Paris.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you stay with your uncle?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. My uncle lived in Neuilly at this time. It's a suburb of Paris and I had a good time there. I had been to Paris before but.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Not under these circumstances.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="23"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Circumstances, no and then when my parents came they originally had planned to take a vacation in France with my uncle and aunt, but because of the situation we went straight back to London after a couple of days or so.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Together, all three of you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: When they came, did you have--do you remember having discussions, your uncle, they, you about what that situation was and I--I mean--when they--if they only came for vacation it must have been that they--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, no, no, no.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- left the apartment?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: They left but they were going to relax in--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: That's the official version.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So they had finished up their affairs?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, they were finished.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: They were finished, okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In fact, I believe at one point--at least that's the story I was told--that our apartment furniture, etcetera was sent to the United States on a ship which was sunk somewhere.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's the story I had. Whether it's true or not I never know, but it doesn't make much difference.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: No. I want to go back to another point--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- that I didn't tie up earlier and that is your maid.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How long did the family have a maid in Berlin? Did she disappear after things got really tough?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no, no. They always had one.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="24"></span> ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you know her well? Did she help in any way? Did the relations change because of politics?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't think so, no. We had a maid and for some reasons we also had a cook who came in to do some because my mother wasn't feeling well and no, I don't think so.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And my--my grandmother also had a maid and she actually married an Iranian and she ended up in--ha-ha--in Tehran.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, my goodness, how exotic.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And do you think that the maid then, in that case, was involved in wrapping up your parents affairs?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You don't know?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was gone by then.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I left. I left everything behind, let them clean up, ha-ha.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What happened to your wonderful train set?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Who knows?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Who knows, yeah. All right. So they're in Paris?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: They decide that they don't want to go back?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no, no. They never had the idea of going back.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: That was just--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: They decided not to stay in France for a vacation. They were planning to go to England anyway because they had a visa for England.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see. So even in France it was getting tense?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, no, but they were getting tense because of the impending war, that they might not be able to leave Paris.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="25"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's right, so this was the summer of "39?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Summer of "39.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Of course the war started very quickly.</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: In fact, when I got back to--in September "39 I remember that part, it sticks in my mind, I went back to the school in Potters Bay there and the car radio of the headmaster was on and the announcement was the BBC, "we are now ina state of war with Germany". The next sentence was cricket results for the day, ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Ha-ha, ha-ha. Life goes on.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, ha-ha.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It's kind of absurd, huh?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, yes. The BBC had really got some other things which later on I remember distinctly.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Such as?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Such as in approximately 20 seconds it will be exactly six o'clock, ha-ha.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Ha-ha.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Or when my parents moved to Yorkshire later they said intermittent rain will be followed by local showers, ha-ha.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Ha-ha, ha-ha.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Other--the other way, local showers will be followed by--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Intermittent rain?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, that's the gems.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, it has a ring to it, you know, when you start thinking about it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Ha-ha.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Ha-ha. So your father and mother then come to England. Did they already have arrangements as to where they'd stay or did they have a way of paying for a place? How did that--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They first moved into an apartment somewhere in Golders Green. I don't know. They didn't stay with my grandmother at that time. They moved into an apartment in-- somewhere in Golders Green. I don't know where they got the money from and then what happened next is that I was sent to a different school which was more appropriate</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="26"></span> </p><p> for my age group, and that school was in Cranbrook, Kent and that's closer to the English channel. By then the war had broken out and the English got kind of scared that Hitler might jump the channel and--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: He promised that he would.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He promised and now this school was therefore in the danger zone and, you know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was it also a boarding school?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Boarding school, yes. It's still in existence. The other school is not. But it was, I think, something like 15 miles from the coast or something like that, so very close, and when I turned 16 my status turned from refugee to enemy alien because I had a German passport.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell me again, when is your birthday?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: On February 28th.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [had--I didn't have to leave the school, but I was--the police picked me up because I was being interned.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So they took you out of school?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: They took me out of school. The school wouldn't care, you know. I could have stayed there for, you know, for--I started there in--when the school term started in September sometime. Yeah, September until--until February I was there and I could have stayed longer as far as the school was concerned, but I was now--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: An enemy alien.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: An enemy alien and picked up together with several other refugees who happened to be at the school.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah, yeah.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="27"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no. They had no idea.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And what happened then after that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was sent to the other man.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And what was your circumstance there? What was the Isle of Man look like?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was a former hotel or boarding house or something like that, several--it was fairly large. I forget the name of the town. I'll have to look that up, but it was right on the water.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right on the water?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. The Isle of Man isn't very big so.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And so everybody was housed or, you know, interned in this former hotel?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, Ashley has put together a wonderful packet that she showed me. Does that look familiar, that photograph?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [really don't have a recollection to tell you how it, how the--it looked. Where does it say, we were in the main city, Hayward. I don't what's the capitol of the Isle of Man. I'd have to look it up.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: We'd have to look it up.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But it was in that--it was in that place, huh?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: We might have a map of that here.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What memories do you have of, you know, what it looked like, what it was?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, it was very crowded and we were restricted, we could not walk out. I don't know whether there was barbed wire or not, but we were certainly closed in.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: There's a place called Ramsey Mooragh, a central camp Hutchinson camp?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Central camp I think.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="28"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Russian. Something wrote that we had classes in literature and languages and theology and philosophy?</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was later, yeah. I think you have the wrong map there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>Would you like to give it to me? I can find it more easily.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So it was crowded?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was very crowded, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you have any official announcements, any official, you know--anybody come to talk with you about--here we have a map sheet. Here's this Isle of Man.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Douglas, yes, Douglas.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Douglas.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. That's what I was looking for.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Douglas. War time use of Cunningham's Young Men's Holiday Camp and world war 2 camps was Granville, Sefton, Hutchinson, Central, Palace and Metropole and I'd like to get a picture of what went on. You arrived there, it's crowded. Were you like three to a room, four toa room? Were there other German Jewish kids--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>Q -- that you were with?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, there were Jewish kids and some Jewish teachers too, but.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Any grown-ups?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Huh?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Grown-ups too?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, oh yes, grown-ups of course.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I wondered.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: There were refugees that lived in the coastal area that--that had moved there earlier, that had moved to England over since 1933 and they didn't have a chance to become British citizens.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was it only people from that coastal area that's called a danger zone that were interned or was it also anybody?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, it was just that at first. Later on they interned some other people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, your parents, for example, wouldn't have they also been?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My dad I think was for--just for a week, but later, much later. I was gone by then.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="29"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was there a way for you to let them know what happened?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, I think the school called. I had no--no way of sending any--any mail or phone calls, and cell phones had not yet been invented, ha-ha.</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Were you taken by surprise?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. It was, you know--you don't know what comes next, whether you're going to be become bombed or just put away somewhere, and actually we stayed in the Isle of Man for, I don't know, several months and then we were sent to Huyton, near Liverpool, which was a new housing development which had never been lived in and they just put us into the semi-finished houses and from there then we were shipped to Canada.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Before we get there--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you recall what a daily routine was in the Isle of Man in this camp?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You got up in the morning, you get fed in the mess hall something and then you--there was nothing much to do.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So there wasn't--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Except sit around.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So there wasn't a sort of like there wasn't libraries or?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: There weren't things you were forced to do?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no, no.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was there a library? Was there--so just sort of you eat and you sit?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. Yeah. Well, no. At that point the teachers weren't organized into doing anything.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The question was did the teachers help?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It came so suddenly that most people didn't take--I mean, I had one little suitcase with the clothes I had.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: At school?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: At school, that was all I had.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you recall when you--did you have direct contact with your parents at some point while you were in there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="30"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So you just assumed that they would know where you were because of the school?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Or hoped that they did?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And they weren't able to write to you or contact you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not until we got to Canada.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So that was separate, that is, your parents had one route and you had another route?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Is that right?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But their route was not as an enemy alien or was it?</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, yes of course, they were also German citizen but they lived there. They had moved out of London to some place, I forgot where, a small village north of London because of the bomb scare or something like that so--and then, because my father was trained as an orthopedic surgeon, he applied for and got a--a license to be a doctor in Britain without going through the exam.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Which was huge.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Which was huge, yeah, and so he got a job in a coal mining district in Yorkshire, in Wakefield and they moved to Wakefield and they first lived in a small house and then later on they bought a much larger house because nobody else had, in the war time, wanted to buy a large house. They got it cheaply and then, in fact, we were just in England last October and I went to look at it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, it's still there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So while their son is in a camp, they're able to become home owners?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, that was later, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. I'm confused. What does later mean? Still during the war?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: A year later I think. This was "39-1940. I think they bought this in "41.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's a nice looking house, brick, large.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: uhu.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="31"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay. Then explain it a little bit to me. You are in a camp in 1940.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right, from March 1, 1940?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: uhu.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You're in the--you're taken to the Isle of Man, several months you're there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: uhu.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Sitting around basically?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And then at some point, was it the summer of "40 you were taken to Liverpool?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. And how long are you in Liverpool?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't know, two, three weeks, something like that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And then shipped to Canada?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: All the while your parents are--your father's arrested for a week and yet then he's released, he gets a job, he's able to become certified as a doctor, as an orthopedic surgeon?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Moves to Wakefield?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: uhu.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And is able to buy a--first a smaller then a larger house?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I think the first one they rented.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Oh, okay. But then buys this larger--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: --kind of house?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And they must have been, of course, frantic to know where you were?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="32"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, by that time they had some news or it was in the newspaper or something like</p><p> that I was in--in Quebec.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. So let's talk about that a little bit.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: All right. The boat ride was slow. We were in a convoy with destroyers on both</p><p> sides.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, you were a dangerous group?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no, no. This was the--</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Ha-ha.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You brought things. I think the HMS Sobieski, but they had packed it so full that I</p><p> had to sleep on the dining room table during the crossing, which was about a week.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, my goodness.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Or more, more than a week.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So the boat was the HMS Sobieski?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And it was--and there were U boats in the waters?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I assumed because they had them escort the destroyers. There were several</p><p> ships going.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Some supply ships I guess, but they wouldn't tell us of course.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And we ended up going up the St. Lawrence all the way to Three Rivers, Quebec.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I don't know where that is.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It's halfway between Quebec City and Montreal.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's quite far north.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And what do you remember from that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, the first thing I remember is that they had a prisoner of war camp in that city and</p><p> the Canadians, in their wisdom, wanted to put us refugees in with the prisoners of war.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="33"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: You were enemy aliens.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, that's right, but the prisoners of war being protected by the Geneva Convention objected to have Jews in their camp so they Canadians had to build another camp right next door to it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It is a bit of a theater of the absurd, isn't it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, that sort of verifies the Jews and the military intelligence.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Ha-ha. That could have been another BBC kind of proclamation, ha-ha.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Ha-ha.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Very well put, ha-ha. And was this the closest that you came to actual enemy aliens of the United Kingdom?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes, yes. They were about 400 feet away. We were on the boat and they were--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Ha-ha.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: --ha-ha, off the river.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And so how long were you in this newly constructed--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Camp?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Camp.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I'm not sure. Must have been about a year or so and--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: That ends up being a very long time.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. In fact, I learned all about baseball because in the dining hall, if you piled several tables on top of one another and then climbed on top there were skylight windows and you could look out into the baseball field. That was a professional baseball field that was next door so we had nothing else to do so we climbed up and watched baseball, ha- ha.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's really weird.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Somebody in the camp, I don't know which camp this was, but I think it might have been the one in Quebec, took--smuggled the camera and put it in a shoe box and took pictures.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, my.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: That was strictly--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And you have some of those?</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="34"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, I have pictures of those.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, the people who were running these places, whether it was in the Isle of Man or Liverpool or Canada, how did they treat you folks? Did they know how absurd it was?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>Did they realize?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, they were dumb, ha-ha.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Ha-ha, that's--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We were then shipped to a camp in--near Fredrickton in New Brunswick and there that was in the middle of the woods.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, nowhere.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Middle of nowhere. We were cutting--taken out of camp to cut trees to thin out--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: The forest?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. I learned how to cut trees with an ax, and saw stuff, split wood and every good thing like that and one of the things I remember, one of the guards who were all veterans of World War I, I believe, since the others were used in sat down on the cut of tree stump and we had to help for him to get up because he couldn't get up, ha-ha, but here are the pictures. Now, I'm not sure which camp--this may have been the camp in Three Rivers because of the table things up here. Here's a typical room we were in. It's not pictures of me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, of the place.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Of the place, and here's barbed wire fences and sort of.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It still looks kind of bloomy.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Industrial places, yeah. Here's one. Oh, this fell off. Well, that was a--the hall, the dining hall somewhere and you can see the barbed wire here. Let's see, there's some more.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Were you angry that all of this was happening?</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Now here's something to note. We all had to wear blue shirts with a big red circle on the back.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Target practice?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Target practice, yes. Here's the view of the camp. I don't know how he took these pictures, but he did a good job.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="35"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can we keep this? Okay, thank you. This is a photo of the HMS Sobieski, which we will include in the information that we've got, thank you. That is, 1 come back to my question.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: If somebody had picked me up when I'm 16 years old and I had just fled from danger and they're calling me an enemy alien, I'd have a few very distinct feelings about this whole system.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, yes and no because you're being removed, you didn't have any choices.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Of course not, you had no choices.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They didn't give you a choice. You can do this or that. You just go, you know, and you know, if the--I guess the drive is to keep alive, not jump the barbed wire fence.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No, not jump the barbed wire fence, but did you feel anger and resentment towards the British authorities or panic?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Panic more, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was--what did you feel panicked about?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, what's going to be next.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Because none of this is known.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: None of this.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: None of this is known, no. Now, some of the internees that were in the camp, and in this one and the one near Frederickton were German seamen who happened to be in British ports at the time who were also interns.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So they weren't refugees?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: They weren't refugees and the other one, which I remember distinctly was two, two acrobats who were performing somewhere and they were--and I remember them because they were diligently practiced every day. They did the kind of acrobatics where you lift somebody and do contortions and, you know, without--just for floor exercises and stuff like that.</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: This was in the Isle of Man?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, that was in Canada.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In Canada?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="36"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The Isle of Man there wouldn't have been floor room to sit down and stretch out, ha- ha.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You know, like they say, sometimes you can't make this stuff up, ha-ha.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Ha-ha.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You know, who would think, ha-ha, you know?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Ha-ha.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were they--were--did you talk to them?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, sure.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And were they sort of like, were the discussions and interactions normal?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yes, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So it wasn't they had a feeling of oh, my God?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: They--they had--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Here's these Jews. We don't want to be with them.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, no. They weren't Nazis. They didn't practice--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: {Coughs} Excuse me.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And I think the people who were seafarers are more international minded anyway because they called on various ports, so they didn't have the indoctrination. They weren't always home either to see that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: {Coughs} Excuse me. {Coughs}. I don't know how to suppress these things.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Would you like a cough drop.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No, I'm fine. Thank you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We have those, ha-ha.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's okay. It just came on unexpectedly. Are we on again? Okay. Well, you know that's interesting, I have a theory that the Netherlands is the way it is because of exactly that reason. It was a seafaring country. It's economy for hundreds of years was in trade by and I think that's one of the reasons it was such an open place to the world maybe.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Maybe even a bit too open.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="37"></span> ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. This is not from the camp, but that's about what the New Brunswick thing looks like, all the piles of wood and little trees that were cut down to thin out the woods.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And how long did you stay there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Until 1942.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You made friends?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, yes. Permanent--well, we made friends really after we left because we all traveled to Winnipeg.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So explain that a little bit.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You weren't friends with people--well--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh, yes, yes. There were friends there and, in fact, in one of the camps they organized--the teachers organized some classes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: This is already in Canada?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, that's in Canada, so we had some schooling. Not very much but some. But I was with some others to pass the metric form, gill.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's not bad. That's not bad at all, ha-ha, you know, ha-ha.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Ha-ha.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Jeepers, for being pumped out of school at the age of 16, ha-ha and--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And did you attend Magill?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. Well, I couldn't. I was behind, but no.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Magill was kind enough to pass the exam papers to the teachers and so we could--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Take them?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Take the exam in the camp, that's why that's Magill.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="38"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Wow. Were the classes in German or English?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In English.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In English, so the teachers were not refugees themselves?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: They were?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. What they were teaching in English too so they had to know some English.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So what happened? What happened when it all came to an end?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, through the good auspices of the Canadian Jewish Committee and, in my case and some others, the auspices of the alumni of Sigma Alpha Mi fraternity who financed four of us to come to Winnipeg, stay in a boarding house, attend--finish high school and then attend university.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Well, before we get there--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What made it happen that you were no longer enemy aliens or were you still?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh, yeah, we still were but we were in Canada now and the Germans were not going to leap the Atlantic to--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: To Canada?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Also the--we were Jewish and the Canada Jewish committee vouched for us somehow.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I mean, the English just didn't differentiate between a Jew and a non Jew in terms of it's just--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: It was a passport issue.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. The passport issue and the passport I had didn't have the J on it like they did later, so.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Then my next question is is that were there people that you left in the camp?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. So it was only because of the vouching of the Jewish, Canada Jewish committee?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: --committee and the financial assistance from the fraternity alumni.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="39"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, tell us about this, because who is this fraternity alumni and what is this organization and how did your path interflow across it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Sigma Alpha Mu is a fraternity that was founded 101 years ago.</p><p>{Someone speaks, inaudible}</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: He should say it because we're on tape, okay?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, they had brought some refugees over from Germany before that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: To Canada?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: To Canada, yes and--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Was it a Jewish--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, it's a Jewish fraternity.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And there was this particular group were alumni from the city, in the city of Winnipeg, from the University of Manitoba, and they got together and, you know, there were most of them I think were in the garment business at that time so they were reasonably well off. Not billionaires, but they managed to finance the four of us and of course university--that's the mail.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. It's okay. We can keep on going.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. The university fees at that time were much lower than they are now. I mean, it's--you're talking about $100, $300 a year or something like that so it wasn't enormous amount they had to come up with but it was very nice of them. We traveled all the way to Winnipeg and stayed in a boarding house and I'm still friends with one of or--well, one of--two others and I kept close touch even after we graduated and one kid there lived in New Jersey and he died a few years ago and Hans Sadler lives in Ottawa and he's still there, at least last time I talked to him which was about a half year ago, so we're still in touch.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was this the first freedom, was this essentially freedom?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yes. I was unfettered. I mean, we could go anywhere in theory.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And the Canada-Jewish community vouched for you, but there were so many other kids left in the--what happened?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, some others got somewhere else but I don't know about them, you know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="40"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think they may have released more at that point. What happened to the rest of them somebody wrote a history of this, but I don't know. I don't have the address saying they kept sort of details of what happened to the other internees, but ultimately of course they were released.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, you were then in Winnipeg. Is that the first you were able to freely correspond with your parents?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. We had those, you know, the war-time letters, the blue envelopes. You could send one a month from the intern camp.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you were half away world from them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, a long way.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. So you finished your undergraduate studies in Winnipeg?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. I finished grade 11 and 12 in less than a year because I had some--some credits already and then I took a degree in mathematics and physics, physics and mathematics, which ever way you want to say.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It happens to be my daughter's favorite course, by the way, physics.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And that was your undergraduate degree?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And by that time the war is over, isn't it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. I graduated in "46. The war was over and I traveled from Winnipeg actually to Washington, just to sightsee. I stayed one night or two nights in the fraternity house here.</p><p>They had a fraternity house at that time and then traveled to New York where my cousin lived, and then traveled to England to see my parents because I hadn't seen them since 1939.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: That's amazing. I mean, that part of this is so amazing is that everybody is in safety, relative safety, but that you are--that you are prevented--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oceans apart.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Oceans apart and that they're leading a reasonably normal life in a war time--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: --place, but they're not in any more danger than anybody else would be and you are in a camp--</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="41"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: --you know. Did they know of such details of what your life was like or were you only able to tell them then?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I wasn't--well, the details are hard to communicate in a letter that's only this long, you know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: One of the little details in the camp in New Brunswick, we used to go out to cut wood but most of the time we spent. We also learned to make camouflage nets, macrame.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: macrame. Was that useful in later life?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I learned how to do knot things. The amusing part, at one point there were a lot of deer around. Normally when you go to the zoo the deer are behind the fence. This time we were behind the fence, the deer were looking at us from the outside, ha-ha.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: There's something ironic in that picture, ha-ha, ha-ha.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Ha-ha.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh my, oh my. Well, when did the panic stop?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, by the time I was in Canada I think I felt more--more secure and people were in the same boat, you know. We didn't panic anymore. We were not happy, you know, to be behind barbed wire but not--not unhappy or repressed or fearful that something would happen. I mean, the military still were kind of stupid, to put it mildly. I mean, I remember one time the inspecting officer came into the kitchen, which was also staffed by the internees, and sort of put his fist into the soup or something and--ha-ha, educated people, you know, they just stood there like that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What do you do? What do you do?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When you saw your parents again had they changed?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They had grown older, but I think basically not, basically not. My dad was happy to be employed in medical things, in the hospital. He had good friends in the hospital.</p><p>They all liked him. My mother was able to exercise her child psychiatry and she went to various clinics in Bradford and Wakefield and Leeds I think and she traveled from one to the other.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When did their citizenship change and when did your citizen zip change?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: My citizenship changed when I stayed four years -- five years in Canada.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="42"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So you became a Canadian citizen?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And theirs, did they become citizens of the U.K.?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yes, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And did you stay with them then when you went back to England or did you not?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I stayed with them on the weekends. I went to the University of Birmingham, which is far away and I stayed there and in a lodging house or something like that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And what were you studying?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Physics. Nuclear physics actually at that time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And after you finished was it a Ph.D program?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, yes. In "49 I got my Ph.D and I got a job in a company, Associate Electrical Industries in a research lab in Aldermaston, which is near Redding, that's west of London, and I stayed there for a year and a half or two years, I'm not quite sure. The work was very interesting because that was at the time that semi conductors were just becoming useful and the university--and actually took some courses at the University of Redding on semi conductors because the work I was doing in that research lab was growing semi conductor crystals and whatnot, so that was trying to duplicate the work done by Bell labs.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What happened then?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, the work was interesting but the pay was terrible. I mean, they paid so--so little that in--in future job applications I always put the--what I earned down in British pounds because it wasn't obvious how few dollars it was, ha-ha. And after that I was lucky to get a two-year appointment to the with the Canadian government to work in their research lab in Ottawa so I went back to Ottawa and I worked for two years, two-and-a-half years there and then the appointment ended and I worked for Canada Air in Montreal in their research lab.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: My mother worked for them too.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yeah?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, yeah. As a secretary.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh. And I worked there for, I don't know, one or two years, or something like this and then my cousin who was in living in New York by that time said why don't you come down to New York and I can find a job for you and this was for a small company that  <span class="page-break" number="43"></span> </p><p> made scientific instruments, so I emigrated from Canada into New York by car, ha-ha, and I worked in New York for eight years, nine years. Six years when I met you so eight years I guess, and it was interesting work in a way that I had to do anything from designing circuitry to supervising the assembly line to designing the cabinets and having them photographed for of the advertising brochure.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you end up in the advertising brochures?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no. A photographer did this but I told him watch what angle to take and what to emphasize and whatnot and this company made things like PH meters and photometers under their own name and also for some other brands and.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And mainly for the--well, for the printing business and for the pharmaceutical industry and always when marking objects to buying a generic brand, I always think of what the-- the--the instruments that were bought by America and other big companies looked like when they came back to the company I worked for for servicing. You would not believe that an instrument which uses colored light beams to examine the concentration of chemicals looked like it was thrown into a vat of paint. They were dirty, they were incredible. I just looked at them, how could they even use them in this condition? So my--the--the white coat image that the advertisers like to project was destroyed forever, ha-ha.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Ha-ha. When or did you go back to Berlin?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Only after the Burgermeister from Berlin invited us to go there. In fact, we had to pay our own way to get there. The fair we had to pay-- {Unidentified woman interrupts:} They paid fair for some people.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah, but they put us out for a week in a fancy hotel and--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: What year was this?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The year before the Berlin Wall came down.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So it was Mumpers probably, Mumpers was the mayor. I remember hearing right around that time of--of such--such events.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, they had many many groups. Thousands came back, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. Did you go see where your apartment was?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Ha-ha. The number--the house number is still there but the buildings are completely destroyed.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="44"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So they were bombed?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They were bombed. They built up some new stuff, jerrybuilt some stuff that looked pretty awful.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not the building I lived in was beautiful. It was a very old building. I had two courtyards and the entrance actually went through a entrance big enough to drive the horse-drawn garbage truck through and there was a door on the side that led to the staircase, but they had the horse-drawn garbage truck come in and they emptied the garbage can from the back yard and they came back out again. You must know something about that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Oh, yeah, ha-ha. So that building probably that was destroyed was probably--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Absolutely.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: --was probably a 19th century building.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Or something like that. Did you have coal ovens, was that how the hospital was heated?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, yes, briquettes, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I remember the briquettes, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Tile, tile ones.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Sometimes they were quite beautiful.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, they were quite good. They kept warm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, yeah. So the number was there but the building was gone?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was the sport palace still there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think so and--yeah, on the corner there was an office building which I remember from my youth because unlike the--most of the building, it wasn't a stucco structure, it had stone sort of facing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The flat stone with sharp edges.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="45"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And as a kid I used to walk along and sort of drag my finger along the sharp edge just because it felt funny, you know, ha-ha.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Ha-ha.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And that building was still there. The pharmacy on the block was still there and some other store was still there, but.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was there any kind of connection for you to what you were seeing or was this like it could have happened to another person a long time ago?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, it's, you know, it's--it's no personal loss because I was much better off by that time. It was interesting to see that the aubonne (ph) was still there but, in fact, they closed down. They had used it as a store or something like that, something peculiar there. The trains didn't run that day or maybe they had some, but otherwise it looked drab as usual, ha-ha.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Hmm. Well, I've come, I think, close to the end of the interview.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The last thing I'd like to ask is sort of like to wrap it up is your personal connection.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>You met in New York I believe?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And your wife's name is?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Marjorie.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Marjorie. Do you have children?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. We have two children, a boy Jonathan and a girl Valerie and they--Valerie lives in Germantown and Jonathan lives in Pointed Rocks and is about to move even farther away, but we have ten grandchildren altogether. Some are his, hers and theirs and my son married twice so he has a blended family of seven children.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uhu.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And my daughter has twins and one other girl, a boy and girl twin and another girl.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q:And--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And there are pictures over there.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Oh, I see there's lots of them {Unidentified woman: Everybody is over there. }  <span class="page-break" number="46"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Everybody is over there, yeah. Have they expressed an interest--have you talked to them about all that happened?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: My daughter, yes.</p><p>{Unidentified woman: My son.}</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My son isn't interested.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh. Is there something that you think needs to be part of the story that we didn't cover that I didn't ask that you'd want people to know about?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>{Unidentified woman: You became a USS. citizen.}</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, I became a USS. citizen after I lived in New York and I got a job with the National Bureau of Standards.</p><p>Well, I had to be a U.S. citizen for that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you keep your Canadian citizenship?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, I couldn't at that time. It wasn't possible. I should have maybe.</p><p>{Unidentified woman: At that point it wasn't dual citizenship.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. I think I missed one point. I felt most desperate was when I was entering the University of Manitoba, what courses to take. I couldn't ask my parents, I couldn't consult with anybody. I sort of knew what I wanted to do but, you know, it's nice to talk it over.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Of course.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And I had never--it just wasn't--by mail it wasn't--my parents wanted me to be medical, you know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Of course, that's what they were, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: But I wasn't interested in that, but I felt very much alone, lonely, making that decision what course to take and what subjects to--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Well, English is such a language that has such, you know, you have words that have so many different meanings and when you talk about what course to take one can understand it by should I take physics or how should I direct my life?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, well.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Ha-ha.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And in a sense the two are related.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="47"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Because after all, it makes a difference if you take, I don't know, mining, engineering.</p><p>You'll have a different life than if you take--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did you regret the decisions--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: --that you took?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I didn't but I was unsure of myself at that point what should I do. I think in order to sort of--in a sense of guilt I took a first-year course in biology in the university, although I really wasn't that interested in it, but I thought at least something that pre med, you know, ha-ha.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: To make parents happy.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, ha-ha.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What did they--were they ever angry, bitter, sad? What were their--I mean, everybody had losses.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Uhu.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But the younger you are, if you all survive, the younger you are your losses are fewer because you have fewer years invested. They had more years invested so their losses were spanning not just a childhood, but a substantial part of--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Their life.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: --their life.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah. Well, I think their life in England they had many friends and good neighbors and they were happy there and they still traveled, they were able to travel. The family did own some still real estate in Berlin and at one point I did a trade off with my cousins.</p><p>I sold them my share in one building and they sold me their share in the other building and then, with the help of a very capable supervisor or whatever-- {Unidentified woman: Investment advisor. }</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, not investment. He was a lawyer actually, but real estate lawyer. He managed to renovate one of the buildings which was really run down and the city was interested to keep the outside--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: The same?</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="48"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The baroque, the facade, but the inside was redone and the city subsidized that so I really--I didn't get any income from this building for many many years.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uhu.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But ultimately it paid off when I sold it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, I would think. Was this the center of Berlin?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Bach Strasse.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Bach Strasse. I don't recall it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It's not in a working class neighborhood, but it was a substantially a large building. I don't know how many apartments there were in there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was that--I mean, that's such a personal--a family owned it even through these trades, was there any compensation that came to your family from the German government?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>{Unidentified woman: A thousand dollars. }</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Very little.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: A thousand dollars did you say?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah, for missed education, something like that.</p><p>{Unidentified woman: They don't--}</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I guess-- {Unidentified woman: all we ever got was a thousand dollars because--}</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, the property was reinstated but no financial--no direct payment-- {Unidentified woman: Your father had a very poor advisor. }</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, he had a poor poor lawyer.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That is your father. I have to repeat this because it has to be on tape. It's okay. Your father had a poor lawyer for any kind of compensation on his count?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, for no fault for managing the houses.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: He got some income from it and he financed his vacation travel from them, you know.</p><p>That was just about what it--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: That's not a lot, yeah.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="49"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And he didn't have a good head for--for--for investment in that sense, but you know, he was happy and he still was able to travel to Switzerland where my mother liked to go, and to northern Italy and when I worked in England I met them there and also some of the times--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: When did your parents pass away?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My father died in "72 and my mother died--let's see. She was--oh, no, she was--she was born in "97 and she was 84, so.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q:"81, 1981?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Did they ever go back to Berlin?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes, yes they did too. A few times? No, I think only once.</p><p>{Unidentified woman: Quite a few times.}</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Okay.</p><p>{Unidentified woman: Your uncle met them there. }</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Now, they--while they were living in Berlin, because of the discrimination and Jews couldn't go to theaters and the opera and things, there was something called couture bondt (ph) and they joined that and I think they had their entertainment or of music and theater came.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: They had an outlet for that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They had an outlet for that.</p></p></dialogue>
