I was born the night that the Knickerbocker Theater in Washington collapsed.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can you tell us where was this camp?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Camp in Texas, in Killeen, Texas. And I -- I stayed there for about a year. I took my basic training there, and I was sent to a s-school. When I graduated from the school, they kept me there as an instructor, and I stayed maybe six or seven months.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How is it that you came into the army rather than one of the other branches of military service?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, that's my own fault, I wanted to go into the Air Force, and I took the Air Force exam, passed it. But I was drafted before the Air Force could get to me. And the rule in that day is, once you're drafted, you can't choose your service.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Your service has to be picked prior to your induction.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Romeo Fagiolo deg March 1, 2010</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, they weren't, they -- I --I think in those days I -- I -- we looked at it as an honor to go into the -- into the army. And if you were rejected, or become a 4F, it was really -- I've seen men cry because they were turned down.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But my parents were from Italy. They were born over there. They met while they were in the United States. And the oddity is that two sisters married two brothers. And they were -- well, you know, we just lived here, and my father took me down to Georgetown and put me on the bus, and as he was walking away, I saw him cry, I had -- I'd --I'd never -- never saw -- never saw my father cry too often.</p><p>But I guess he was happy. But they were always good to me, I had a good family.</p><p>And so I went to Fort Hood. And after I taught there for awhile, I tried to get out of teaching. I--1 wanted to get into a --a lion outfit, which was a -- not -- not necessarily a fighting outfit, but do something other than just teach my whole career. So I put in for what they called ASTP.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What does that stand for?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I-It stand for Army Specialized Training Corp.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And the purpose of that was, you would go to some university, get a degree from college, and upon graduation you were obligated to serve two years as an officer in  <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> Interview with Romeo Fagiolo deg March 1, 2010</p><p> the army. So I went to Texas A&amp;M, and I was there about maybe four months, and they disbanded --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The program?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- the program. So they sent me back, at that time was Camp Hood, and during the interim, the camp had changed from a -- a tank destroyer, to the infantry.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Why was it called an infamous camp?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, ni -- because of the recent -- the recent episode --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Ah, that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay, because of that, okay, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But it -- it-- it's one of the largest camps in the U.S. Army. I think from one end of the spectrum to the other is like 26 miles. That's why it's a --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. So you're talking about a shooting that took place in 2009, but you were there half a century --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Before.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- before. Yeah, okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: So anyway, I ended up in the infantry, and I did one --I--I was a [indecipherable] for one cycle, training soldiers. And then I got orders to go to</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> Interview with Romeo Fagiolo " March 1, 2010</p><p> Camp Gruber, Oklahoma, which was the 42(tm) infantry division. And I was in that camp, I think July or in August, and we moved out in -- in November, probably --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: How large was the division?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was -- well, one infantry division usually consists of about 30,000 men.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's a lot.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yeah. D-Day had passed.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And so where -- where was your first European landing with the division?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In Marseilles.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In Marseilles, okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And from there we went up and we caught the lines. And the reason they closed the ASTP is that they had lost more men on D-Day than -- than we've advertised or reported. So they were short of infantry people. And when we went over, we were only the three infantry divisions.

And the first night that we were in battle, I had a sleeping bag, it was down. And I got it on a raffle, cause they only gave one per platoon. So the first night we tried to bed down, I couldn't find my bedroll. And it was common in the army to say it was a midnight requisition, that somebody had acquired it. So anyway, the next day -- his name was Clifford, he came over to me and he says, Romeo, I'm sorry, I grabbed your bedroll by mistake. Cause he knew it was mine, cause it was the only one.</p></p></dialogue>

And when I went there after it was over, there was a fellow called Valentime(ph), he had red hair, and there was red hair all over the guns and place.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And was this already through southern Germany, or was this still in France?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Th-Th -- no, no, we had -- still in France, and we didn't cross the Rhine, and I remember it was Easter Sunday.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well -- well, they were surrendering, and the story that I always tell, we were in reserve, and I -- they used to give us a chocolate bar to eat. And I was eating that, and I had a tap on my shoulder and I turned around. And it was a German soldier, and he had a white flag.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And he wanted some chocolate?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I guess maybe he did, but that he had a circular from Eisenhower encouraging the Germans to surrender, and that they would be well taken care of, and so forth. So, he was all alone, and I didn't know what to do with him. And luckily, there were other Germans coming from the front, quite a few of them, so I just told him to fall in with the rest of them, and that was the last time I saw him.</p></p></dialogue>

I tell you, their faces were dirty, they were beard. Y-You know, it was really to distinguish the age. And in those days, you know, e-every time we got a German prisoner, they always say, you know, nicht schiessen, you know, Polack, Polack, you know. Don't shoot me, boy.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's right. And was there a difference between the French and the German towns as you were going through them?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. First of all, you could tell the -- being a German, the civilians were well clothed. The French had nothing. Clothes, you could tell the difference, I don't know about soap and things like that, but once you hit Germany, there was a different class of people, and that they had a better part of the life. And some of the stories that the Frenchmen tell, it's a-- you know, it's disgraceful.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What did you hear? What were some of those stories that the -- that the French were telling?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And of course, when he did that, that was the end of it, and the other Germans had killed the rest of them. And in retaliation, they took the wives, seven wives, and they took them to -- to Germany and this one lady that she had a eight months old baby girl, and when she got on the boat, they took the baby from her, and the put it on a crib, in a box on the deck of the ship. And when she came out the next morning the baby was gone. And of course they assumed that -- that they just threw her overboard. And she ended up as a -- working fine wires for the German in some factory. And when they were -- when she was liberated -- I wasn't there, incidentally, this was told to me by, you know, another company, that those women were all in cells. They would open the cells, and they wouldn't come out. And they would tell them, you know, you're free, you're free. But they were just scared. They didn't know -- i-i-i-it makes you cry, it really does. The people were just scared, they lived from day to day. They never knew when they were going to be the last day.

I mean, the Germans would come at you with eight, 10 tanks, so we were really busy. But when we started to move, and then the battle fatigue for me, was to stay in one place. Because the longer you stayed there, you would lose one man today, and another one tomorrow. And finally after a week you'd -- you know, you would get jittery.

And some of those civilians really had a hard, hard life. You know, I've had mothers tell me that, you know, they put the babies to bed, get them settled down, the air raid siren goes on, grab the kids, take them to the shelter, get them settled. All clear came out, take them back home. And that's only once, but when you do that every night for months, it's hard. It's very, very hard. So those -- th-the civilians, even though they were Germans, I always respected the Germans, and I always respected the Wehrmachts.

And she died, and the baby outlived the mother. And you could tell that she was grabbing her mother's breast, pulling her clothes away to -- for something to eat. And then you see two of them dead, just sitting there, mother and whatever, they were. But the thing is, to think that they had to suffer, that's the part that -- that is -- that's unbelievable.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Better shape.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Course, the -- all they wanted to do was get out. And they had to contain them, which wasn't an easy job to do.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Why would they had to be contained?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because they were all diseased, there was a lot of disease in the camp. They didn't want the prisoners running around in the streets of Munich, in -- in a diseased state.</p></p></dialogue>

And they killed -- they killed --I think there was 35 SSs, they never lived to tell the tale. And they had electric fence around the camp, that wasn't turned on, which made it easier for their -- the troops in front of us. And then, the pride I take getting -- walking down by those railroad tracks, the G.L.s in front of me, they heard a moan. And they climbed up, and they literally had to walk on corpses, I mean it. They finally get to this one fellow, and they pulled him out and he was still alive. And imagine just being in with a bunch of dead people, you know? And -- but they got him on a Jeep, I saw that, and they took him away, I guess they took him to the medics. And the joy part of [indecipherable] is that in 95, which is 50" anniversary of the liberation, I went to it in--in--in Munich, this fellow that they pulled out came to that reunion.</p></p></dialogue>
