And I said, yeah. He said, I did, too. So, they had plundered all these shops. There was stuff all over the street: clothes, bicycles, whate -- whatever the shop sold, was on this major street. And we couldn't -- how could this happen? So we got to school, and the minute we got to our classroom, we were told to go to an assembly, which was outside in a courtyard.</p><p>The two schools had two different buildings. And one of the buildings was on fire.</p><p>And needless to say, there was a little confusion in the courtyard. And the rector spoke on a microphone and said, you are to try to reach your parents by phone.

And in the car was my grandmother, my mother, waiting for us. And, where are we going? My father said, we're going to some lovely people, friends of mine, who have a farm, about three hours away. And we're just going to have a little picnic -- my mother had packed a lunch -- we're going to have a little picnic. And little had we known what had gone on during the day at -- in -- in the business. We had no -- I had no idea. So we drove all night, and we finally came to this town where we were supposed to be with friends. My father got out of the car and went into a pub, to call his friend and say we were close by. And the friend said, don't come. The Nazis have just come into my town, and you will not be safe here. Just keep driving. So we drove through the whole night. And when we had to relieve ourself, there -- couldn't go anywhere, you went -- you made do.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And my nursemaid was there, and we had dinner, whatever, and then we rented an apartment somewhere. I don't know where. I --I have very little recollection of that time -- that was November til January -- because things were terrible. So, I don't <span class="page-break" number="50"></span> ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion Interview with Susi Frank Annes ~ October 4, 2015 know whether I have blocked that out of my mind completely. However, my father, the next day that we got home, my father disappeared. Totally disappeared. And for three days, we had no idea where, how, what. The Germans had taken him, and thrown him into prison. Which was -- every other man was taken off the street, for whatever reason. No reason whatsoever, just pull him. Fortunately enough, the -- he had friends, an attorney, who got him out of jail. That was the first time. And after that, things were terrible, because he had to go back to the business every day to try to finalize plans. This was -- then they were forced to sell the business. But what happened during that time, I can't tell you, except that my father was taken again, oh, I think right in December, somewhere in December, and never knew how my father got out of jail, until my mother was on her deathbed, and she said, I think I ought to tell you something I have never revealed to anyone. So she told my sister and myself how she managed to get my father, and I don't think I ought to tell that story.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Oh, you've piqued my curiosity. Can you go around it a little bit? Is there any way --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, I-- she found a way --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: --using herself -- <span class="page-break" number="51"></span> ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion Interview with Susi Frank Annes degdeg October 4, 2015</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Oh, dear.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: --to engage the head Nazi in an evening. And my mother didn't drink, but she spent the night with this person at a bar. And every time she didn't feel well, she would relieve herself, and start drinking all over again, until he was -- i-it's just too involved.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: However, he signed a paper in his stupor. She said to me the best part about this story is that he invited her to go home, she's a very attractive woman. And she said she'd love to. And it got very involved. And she said, but the only way she would consent is if he would be so kind, and give his signature, so that her girlfriends, who were like herself -- probably figured she was a lady of the night -- her girlfriends would never believe that he invited her. So, she took out a piece of paper, which was a consent to have my father relieved from prison.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh my gosh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: She had never told this story.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you think he knew, your father?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I--I don't know if he ever knew. I don't know. And she -- this was like just before she died, she told me. So, I would say she -- she was some lady.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yes, yes. And thank you for sharing that.

It is part of what was the reality, and what somebody had to do in order to survive, and help a loved one get out.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Lasked her, I said, how could you even think of doing this? And she said, when you're in need, you do whatever you have to. That was my mother.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Amazing. Thanks. We're going to break for lunch now. Thank you.

And I wanted to explain a little bit why I wanted to know this detail, simply because people should not have only a sanitized version of what others went through in order to survive.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>And that often, you had to make a tough decision. Now your mother told you this only on her deathbed. Can you tell me what kind of thoughts ran through your mind?

I mean, she would do things that we would say would be silly, or crazy. And I'm sure that's the way she vented her difficulties.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: By -- by finding something about it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think so.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And it seemed that friends would gravitate to her, because she had this charm. I- It was so innate, it was her.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And she ended up being a savior.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Absolutely.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So when your father emerged from prison the second time, was it, or maybe the third, I--I don't recall.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay. <span class="page-break" number="73"></span> ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion Interview with Susi Frank Annes " October 4, 2015</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: So that happened the last day of my -- prior to getting onboard ship. Now, about five years ago, or four years ago, this doctor, Dr. Keesing gets my name through an organization here that's -- the Kindertransport has an organization. I went to one or two meetings, and find out about Dr. Keesing.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay, so we're going -- at this point I'm going to interject and say that, we're talking about -- now jumping ahead to about 2010, and Dr. Keesing is -- tell us who she is, and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Okay.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And I -- through this organization, I heard her name, I emailed her, and she emailed me back, all of which I have documented, wanting to know where I was, what happened to me. And she writes me this -- all of this information of the documents of my entry, the documents of my exit of Holland. She had already documented me, she knew all about me. But she's trying to figure out how this all <span class="page-break" number="74"></span> ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion Interview with Susi Frank Annes % October 4, 2015 happened. So, on our second or third email, I said, with all the work you're doing, I have been thinking about a young man by the name of Danny Appel(ph), and I had no response. I can't figure it out, because previously she emailed me back right away. One evening I am by myself, right here, and the phone rings. And a gentleman is on the other line, and he said he'd like to speak to me, and was I in Holland, blah, blah, blah. And I'm sure that this is a hoax. So I said, I'm terribly sorry, but I don't know who you are, and I'm going to hang up the phone. And he said, no, no, no, no, no, he said, I forgot to mention Dr. Keesing gave me your number. Well, with that I knew whoever this person was. It turned out to be Danny Appel(ph) --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Wow.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: --who is no longer Danny Appel(ph). He was -- he remained in Holland at the beginning of the war, but when he was -- the entrance into Holland, his German passport, he was Rudolf Appel(ph), that was his name. He changed it to Daniel, Danny for short. That's what he was known by. So when I'm asking for Danny, he is no longer Danny, he jar -- he joined the French underground --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Oh my goodness.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- and survived in France, under Danny. He -- he finally gets a visa to come to the United States, and his passport is Rudolf, so he has to change his passport back <span class="page-break" number="75"></span> ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion Interview with Susi Frank Annes &gt;&gt; October 4, 2015 to Rudolf. And I said to him, I have your picture, and he said, I can't believe it. So I went, enlarged the picture, send it to him. And my children said, Mom -- this was in February, so my children said, get on a plane and go to New York. I said no, it's wintertime, I'm not doing that. So that summer, I did just that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And he has two daughters, and he was alive and well. However, we have been calling each other to say hello. I called him for the holidays. I called him three times, and left a message, and I have not heard. So I make the assumption that [indecipherable] something's not right there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Well, what a -- what a gift, you know, so many decades later, to find the boy who gave you the rose, right before you leave. <span class="page-break" number="76"></span> ontactrefieannedjustanmiang er hither btemelortabnattfiexaliaton Interview with Susi Frank Annes .deg October 4, 2015</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And he is very involved with Dr. Keesing, because all his gentlemen, all his boy friends who survived, he was able to give Dr. Keesing the information where they are, what happened to them.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Wow, wow.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes, definitely. We landed in New York, we were met by a distant cousin, young, young guy, who had been sent to New York by Zeiss camera company as an intern from Germany, and never went back. He's in his like, middle 20s. And he came to the ship to greet us, to tell us that unfortunately, we could no longer go to L.A. All our things went to L.A., and some clothes went to L.A., and we were not prepared for winter, except what we had on our bags. But the gentleman who has sponsored us, who was a Chicagoan, had a brother in L.A.

Did they ever get any compensation for it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: That's -- the following happened. My mother suggested to my dad, that like many, many of their acquaintances, went to Germany immediately, got lots of reparation, or considerations, let's put it that way. <span class="page-break" number="89"></span> ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion Interview with Susi Frank Annes *s October 4, 2015</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My father said, I will never step foot in that country again. They didn't do right by me, and they can keep their reparation. However, when he realized what he had missed, because his friends were all being well taken care of, he decided to get in contact with the attorney who had handled the business deal, who was alive and well. I have all o -- I have a ledger this big of every correspondence that went on, for three years -- or two years, I'm not sure. I have it all. I just went through it the other day, it's amazing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And so what was the end result?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: So the attorney kept suggesting my father come, that without his acknowledging all this. And finally, about, I would say, nine months before the end of the period where you could claim, my father decided to go to Germany. And by the time all the papers were claimed, he could -- he nee -- the date had expired -- th -- the time for that particular law -- there were different laws of personal -- regarding business. And the German who bought, fought the case. He fought the case. And so my father never got anything pertaining to business. However, they did get reparation. Not as much as anybody else did. And I have stuff showing what they got. I think they -- I --I don't know, I'd have to look it up, I think they got something like 500 dollars a month, or 300 dollars a month. Maybe was three. I could look that up, I don't know. <span class="page-break" number="90"></span> ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion Interview with Susi Frank Annes " October 4, 2015</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But they never got --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But very minimal, because he hadn't followed up in the beginning.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay, he wouldn't have come across all of these obstacles.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Under duress, he was not going to do that. So they did, for the rest of their life, did get reparations, yes. Minor.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But not --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: They never got a major sum, with -- many people did, and then their monthly.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So they never got compensated for their business?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Not a penny.

They are -- I always feel they do things cause they know it means a lot to me. They do go to services, but not on a regular basis, you know. But that's fine. They have their value system, I have mine.</p><p>So I have been -- I have always said, I'm so grateful that I had the kind of parents I had, cause I was given values that have served me well, and I -- you learn very early on in life, I was very independent, and I'm very particular about friends I choose.</p><p>And I - I've always been.
