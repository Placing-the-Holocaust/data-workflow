<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You're welcome.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Could you introduce yourself and tell us a little about yourself please?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Okay. I'm tra -- Tracy Strong, born in Seattle, Washington, September 4", 1915, and grew up there. My father had moved to Seattle in 1910 to join the Seattle YMCA as a Boys" Worker. So we spent the first 12 years at -- in Seattle on Queen Anne Hill. Eventually moved up on the boulevard in Queen Anne Hill and built a house looking out over Lake Union. My bra -- I have a older brother Robbins, and a younger sister Ruth, and we enjoyed a very pleasant gro -- time at growing up in Seattle; it wasn't quite as crowded as it is now. The house we built is -- in fact, I just heard from the lady who lives there, she bought it from my father in 1923, and has lived in it ever since. So the house remained the same. We had a normal childhood, my father was always off toa YMCA camp. And summers we'd join him in the camp, so we spent a very pleasant time in Seattle. Then in 1923 my  <span class="page-break" number="0"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Tracy Strong , June 11, 2009 father was appointed to the Boys" Work secretary for the world's YMCA in Geneva, Switzerland, so the family all packed up. I was five, my sister was seven or eight, and my brother was 10 or 11. And my father indicated that if we're going to work in a world's organization, he should see something of the Orient. So we sailed out of Seattle in November 1923 on the -- one of the princess ships, and went, actually, practically all the way around the world in six months. As I think back on that, must -- and have traveled with my own children, here were three young children and my mother taking care of us all the way around the world. We went first to Japan, and got there just after the big earthquake in Japan in 1923. Then M-Moncton(ph), Manchuria, China, Hong Kong. Then around through India, up through the Suez Canal, went over to Palestine, and eventually to Venice, an-and arrived in Geneva in April 1924. Which was quite a trip. So we settled into Geneva, which was then a much smaller town that it is now, but also a very international town, because a lot of international organizations were there, including the international Red Cross, and then many of the other youth-serving or people- serving organizations.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Where did you go to school?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh, we started out in the public school, across the street [indecipherable] where we had to learn French in a hurry if we wanted to play. We children picked up  <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion</p><p> Interview with Tracy Strong deg June 11, 2009</p><p> French very quickly, my folks never did, so we asked them not to speak French when we were, cause their accent was so poor. Anyway, they went there, went to international school for a year or so, and eventually came back to this country for two ye -- my father thought I should learn English, so I came back for two years to a high school in Bainbridge Islands, Washington, and finished high school there.</p><p>Then I was 16, at which time I felt I was a little too young for college, and as he and my mother were traveling a great deal for the y -- world's YMCA, I went to school in Germany, Deutsche Jugend -- Jugendhof, which was 1932. And if you remember your history well, that was the time that Hitler came to power, in 1933.</p><p>So I went through that whole time of the change in regime and cha -- and heard Hitler speak twice, big rallies. And then at the end of the year, went back to Ohio -- Oberlin College, Ohio, where I spent four years and got my bachelor's degree, 1937. At that time I wasn't quite sure what I wanted to do, a chance of working in the YMCA, or in the church. So I went to Yale Divinity School for three years in New Haven, Connecticut. In 19 grad -- got my da -- my master's degree in divinity and it was in 1940, first war had already started in Europe, and my father had headed up the war -- war prisoner's aid of the YMCA, which was approved in the Geneva Convention, that international Red Cross took care of the physical problems of the prisoners on ev-every country, and the YMCA took care of their  <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Tracy Strong deg June 11, 2009 spiritual and intellectual problems, physical problems. So, my father was the head of this organization, but he -- with headquarters in Geneva, although -- and Geneva was still open then. 1940, of course, the -- France fell. In just a few weeks, blitzkrieg [indecipherable] Germans. I did --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: When did -- did you go back to Germany?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I went back to -- actually to ge -- headed for Geneva. Had to take a boat from New York to Lisbon, then across Spain where we got -- just at the time France had fallen, so everything was closed down, so we were stuck in Barcelona for several weeks. And then eventually the group went across southern France and up the Rhone Valley to Geneva. And went originally to work with the European Student Relief fund, which was an organization made up of the three student serving organizations. The World Student Christian Federation, the Protestants. The Pax Romana, the Catholics, NISS, a neutral organization. And our job was to do for stu -- university students what the YMCA was doing for the general population. So we singled out students in camps in every country. I did go to Germany for about six months, to work in the prisoner of war camp, and visited Stalag 16, I think it was, and 17, one section of Germany. The ma -- most of the prisoners were either French or British, Polish. A few ru -- quite a few Russians eventually, which now  <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Tracy Strong " June 11, 2009 because Russia did not sign the Geneva Convention, we could not get into the camps to visit them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What were some of your activities in the camps with the prisoners of war?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Mainly with the YMCA and the -- and the European Student Relief Fund, the ESRF, it's called, for them I was ju -- identify students, and try and get books, material to them, so they continue their studies. See, in the camps, particularly the officers" camps, the officers were not allowed to work. They had nothing to do except organize activities. So the YMCA brought in books, sporting material, violins, anything to keep them occupied during their imprisonment. So I'd go the -- there were about, I suppose, 15 camps that I visited off and on in the fall of 1941.</p><p>Eventually -- course, America wasn't in the war yet, but in 1941 I went back to Geneva. The Germans would not let me go in the camps any more, they thought I had helped a prisoner escape, which was the last thing in the world I would have done. So the Germans went and closed the camps to me. So --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So you went back to Geneva.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So I went back to Geneva. [interruption] So I went in the -- must have been about March I left Germany, went to Geneva, where headquarters were for the ASRF, and -- and by this time there were camps set up in southern France. See, when the Germans took France, everybody in northern France went to the south,  <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Tracy Strong deg June 11, 2009 to get away the rapid advance. The Germans kind of overran everybody, but then, as you recall, it divided France into occupied and unoccupied France, with the occupied being headquarters in Marseilles and Vichy. The Vichy government was set up in -- in Vichy under General Petain, Laval, which put the Germans very much in control. But at least they didn't -- were not interfering in southern -- in oro -- unoccupied France.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell me, who sent you to France? Did Donald Lowrie?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, Donald Lowrie was the head of the YMCA organization in southern France.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: He was based where?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He was based in Marseilles [indecipherable] and -- and the -- our -- our student organization worked with the YMCA, or under the YMCA because they had access to the camps.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So did he ask you do come from Geneva to --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, it wasn't so much his asking, he -- he was in France, and we were -- and the -- my or -- organization, the European Student Relief Fund wanted somebody to coordinate things for students only, in southern France, so I -- and the entry was through the YMCA. So I went, being sent by the European Student Relief Fund, be working with the YMCA.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, there is. A-Andre de Bionay was the head of the organization, was hired by the three religious groups, or student groups that had formed the organization. So I was responsible to him, but my activities were pretty much up to me, what I could do with -- to help students in southern France.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Who funded you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The European Student Relief Fund.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Because you seem to have a lot of tra-- you seemed to travel a lot.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I did. That was part of my job, to travel from camp to camp and help set up the [indecipherable] or the bibliotheques, in the various camps.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And your specific mission was intellectual support, and something else too?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Spiritual, phy -- whatever physical support we could give. You know, I'm sure mainly, my main job was to identify students and see what we could do to either get them out of the camps, or to get them material to study with. Wasn't too happy with students staying in the camps, cause conditions were hardly conducive towards  <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Tracy Strong me June 11, 2009 intellectual study.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you become friendly with some of them?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh, very much so, and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Can you remember some of their names?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, the one I remember the best wa-was Hans Solomon, who -- we stayed friends, so I still correspond with him. Edgar Druenhoot(ph), Hans Mayer(ph).</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Palos(ph)?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Palos(ph), and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And what about some of the artists? You mentioned providing equipment for the artists.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember some of their names?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't remember any of their names, but I still have one or two paintings that they did.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you purchase them?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: We purchased them in a way that -- or they were donated. So -- and we set up exhibitions for them so they could be sold.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Tracy Strong " June 11, 2009</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And what about some of the other artistic activities, they play -- did they play musical instruments?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, well, we were able to provide violins, cellos, guitars. Usually had a piano in the camp. So they would set up small musical groups, depending on the activities, and depending on the interest, depending on the health, because the condition in the camps weren't really conducive to any intellectual work.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You mentioned the Russian choir in your diary? Do you remember meeting a group of Russians?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [remember very vaguely that a group of Russians -- they were mainly though Russians who'd left Russia during the revolution. So they were what you call the white Russians, who had settled in Paris, with a large colony of them in Paris, and with the rest of the French they left the north and came south. So my work was primarily centered in Marseilles, I lived at the Hotel Terminus, and then we'd travel regularly to different camps.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You mentioned traveling with Donald Lowrie, can you talk a little about Lowrie? He sounded as if he were an interesting person.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Very interesting, very active, one of these what do you call it? A-type persons.</p><p>Very outgoing, charming wife, who did all the driving for Donald. And Donald had worked in Czechoslovakia with the Czechs, the Czech YMCA, and  <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Tracy Strong deg June 11, 2009 [indecipherable] Czech, and so had a very special place in his heart for the Czechs.</p><p>Any Czech student came by, always got some help. But Don was also the head of what they called the Nimes committee, which was a committee of all the various private organizations: the Red Cross; Unitarian; Quakers; OSE, Jewish organization. And they met once a month in Nimes, so it became known as the Nimes committee, to coordinate their efforts, and then to intervene. And Don would go to Vichy to talk to the representatives of the government in Vichy about permission to do certain things.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: For example?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, one thing that happened was be able to get the refugees out of the camps, if they could support themselves, so that Vichy government did finally approve that.</p><p>Whereas if an organization would provide for them so the state didn't pay anything, they could get them out of the camps, or a prisoner of private means could get out of the camps.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember going to Vichy with him?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I didn't go to Vichy, I went to Nimes regularly, to the Nimes committee.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you actively participate in the Nimes committee?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, I was representing the student relief fund and -- but the c-committee wa -- it was a very [indecipherable] very worthwhile, very interesting committee, because  <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Tracy Strong 8 June 11, 2009 people of various interests -- the Red Cross, of course, was mainly interested in providing food, and the Swiss Red Cross particularly, took care of a lot of children, whereas some of the other organizations were providing just intellectual or spiritual help.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember some of the people from the Jewish organizations? Did you remember Raoul -- Raymond-Raoul Lambert?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I can't say that I do remember them. I met them all, of course, and knew them, but that's a long time ago.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: At one point you mention that the Vichy government creates a -- an official state organization for all Jewish organizations, Ugeef(ph), u-g-i-f. And -- and you mention in your diary that Raymond-Raoul Lambert was supposed to be the general secretary and he refused. Do you have any recollection of that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not really in any detail.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you also speak about meeting Dr. Markeen(ph) on a -- on a train. He was a doctor who with OSE. Do you remember him?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: A Swiss doctor, I think. I just by chance met him because I travel a good deal, and meet a lot of people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And do you remember some of the memorable sessions of the Nimes committee? Were there certain times when it became animated?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Tracy Strong " June 11, 2009</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, it always was animated, because everybody there was an intellectual when -- very di-different interests, but they all [indecipherable] in their own interests, and -- but willing to cooperate. I remember especially one session where Lowrie asked for a criticism of the committee, or recommendation, what we could do to improve, and it was very open, everybody put in their two cents worth, but very -- very open discussion. Praise for Lowrie as president, because his was a difficult job to bring them together, and get them to work together and go in one voice to Vichy. Vichy was not too cooperative. I think Vichy was not thought of very much by the French themselves. They knew it was under the control of the Germans, that Petain, Laval had very little of independence.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You worked with other organizations like the Cimade, and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Met [indecipherable] Cimade.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. Can you tell me a little bit about the Cimade?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, the Cimade was set up by the French, what they call a fede -- Federation des etudiants, a Protestant organization under Marc Boegner, who was head of the Protestant church in France, which is, of course, very much a minority in f--in France. And Cimade [speaks French].</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p> Interview with Tracy Strong (r) June 11, 2009</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And Mada -- Madame Baro(ph), a very active lady who -- she was probably in her 30s and was the head of it [indecipherable] Vesfal(ph), Dumas, some of the names of people. And they would put students into the camps to set up a foyer with the YMCA and with the European Student Relief Fund. So they had it in most of the camps, not all of them, but Gurs and Rivesaltes, Les Milles,</p><p> they had students living in the camps, running the foyer and organizing various activities for the internees.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Who is the person who was living in Rivesaltes?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Andre Dumas was one, Madame [indecipherable] was another. And they changed from time to time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What about -- who was Mademoiselle Ugand(ph), and Mademoiselle Sen(ph)?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>Were they in with the Cimade, or were they with another organization?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think they were with Swiss Red Cross, which was a big or-organization.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: At one point you talk about traveling with Lowrie and getting a 1 -- a lot done, and you reflect on the fact that you seem to get more done in a week with Mr.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>Lowrie than the five months that preceded. And why was that?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, he -- well, he was a very active person, and had connections all over southern France, and had lived in France, of course, before, so he knew the French. He was able to get the functionaires(ph) to listen to him and do what he  <span class="page-break" number="12"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Tracy Strong 6 June 11, 2009 wanted. But he had that knack of approaching them and not -- not challenging them really, but getting them to listen to him, and then he never asked for more than he thought he could get, in getting permissions from the camps. And he couldn't do anything really to change the camps, but he could call to attention any discrepancies or any errors, or anything that were happening in the camps. And he had a very persuasive approach to the people, and very friendly always.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I noticed that you had all sorts of authorization forms, travel, laisser-passer, you had -- had driver's license, you had all sorts of identity cards, and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Also had all kind of food cards. See, ev-everything was rationed.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Who ga -- who issued your food cards?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Who would what?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Who gave them to you, was it --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The government. Everybody in France had to have coupons for bread, or for meat. For instance, we got, I think enough meat for a month to make one good hamburger. So, was very little meat. There's a big difference between Germany and France, and of course Germany was taking all the food, except the fruits.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>France was a very rich agricultural country, of course, especially in the south, a lot of fruits and vegetables, so we survived pretty much on [indecipherable] and -- [indecipherable] and asparagus. But you had to have coupons for those. As I recall  <span class="page-break" number="13"></span> Interview with Tracy Strong " June 11, 2009</p><p> one -- one of the wives who [indecipherable] committee, Madame Lagalle(ph) went to spend four hours at the market, and just got one [indecipherable] which was not a great deal, but it was better than nothing. So the -- it seemed that food was very much the central part of our lives. And we were much better off, of course, than those in the camps who were getting very little food. But you could always eat well and -- depending what part of France you were in. When I went to [indecipherable] which is another story, and there there was plenty of food.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Or when you went back to Switzerland.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And I - and I went back to Switzerland regularly. I would gain -- go back to Switzerland, gain five pounds and lose it the next time I went to France.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You also worked with the Quakers.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, Ross McClellan.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell me about Ross McClellan, a little.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Very pleasant person, very outgoing. Both he and his wife were very dedicated people, good Quakers. A big -- big fella, he was very imposing, which helped him a great deal.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You speak in the beginning of your diary in the year 1941 about your arrival, and a couple days after your arrival in Marseilles, you witnessed something that the Quakers were doing, and it was food distribution.</p></p></dialogue>

Mainly milk and flour.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How -- how did that work?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: As long as food -- the ships came in, it worked very well, but then the Germans stopped it. There weren't any more food being sent in from abroad, so --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Who was entitled to the -- the food they brought?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Any children. It was mainly a-an attempt to improve the diet of the children in France, not just refugees, but all -- all childrens. So distribution was throughout all of southern France.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I remember you talking about setting up the [indecipherable] in Rivesaltes, and apparently there was a theater there, and you mentioned about --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well -- well, we had built a -- in the foyer, one end of the foyer, a stage, which became the theater, and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And did you put on shows there?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, it depends on the Sunday. Went off pretty well, because half the people could understand French, most of them could understand a little French, but the audience was very mixed. So preaching or talking to them is -- any distraction wa -- and anything di-different that was going on was -- I mean, in a -- not only interrupted the service, but I remember one time when I was preaching, I don't have no idea what it was on, and this Spanish lady down in the front had her baby with her.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, I think the difference between our two cultures, I mean the -- the church in the United States is a -- at least the mainline churches have always had a very social gospel impact, where they felt that more than just religious ideas, but they should also do something for people. Whether it was healthcare, or whether improve foods, or take care of people in prisons, whereas the French were much more intellectual in their approach, and -- and the French loved to discuss, and to talk, a-argue -- very pleasantly, but also very intellectually, and I find -- I found that they were way ahead of us as far -- intellectually as different ideas, which, even though I'd had theological training, I was not ready to discuss in such detail as the French were.</p></p></dialogue>

We had a number of students who were able to get into Switzerland, like Hans Solomon and his five friends made it once into Switzerland, got into the Valais, which is southern part of Switzerland, and were stopped at the Swiss border by the Swiss guards who were from that area, given a nice, big bowl of soup, and then sent back into France, cause Switzerland said they just can't take everybody who wants to come to Switzerland.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, in ni -- at the end of "41, we fi -- figure that the students -- we wanted to do something for the students, and there was a committee of the ESRF in France with Professor Lagalle(ph) from -- from Montpellier, who was the head of the committee -- French committee. And we figured we had to get the students into an atmosphere where they could really continue their studies. We looked over southern France, and a Mr. Guillome(ph) who was a -- worked for the -- a Frenchman who worked for the YMCA, been mayor of a little town Chambon-sur-Lignon [indecipherable] and so we went up to see Chambon, which is very up in the mountains, and a very rural area, and found out that they had a treme -- there are two pastors there, Pastor Truckmay(ph) and Pastor try -- Tise(ph), who are very much the leaders of the community, and they had already had a number of maison d'enfants open at the Swiss Red Cross, that a couple may -- where they could bring children and take care of them during that -- in that manner. And the main difference between Chambon et -- the whole area, the plateau and gau -- and southern France on the coast, was there was plenty of food there.

We -- and we [indecipherable] the hotel overnight, went out in the morning. And the people next to us had had [indecipherable] breakfast sent up, and they put it out in the hall, and there were two pound -- two pates of butter left on the plate, so Melby and I immediately scooped it up and decided this is where we wanted to be.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And who did you finally find?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: There was a miss -- miss -- Madame Pon-Pontay(ph), I think the names were.</p><p>And then eventually Daniel Truckmay(ph), the nephew of one of the pastors took over.

So it was, from that point of view, very successful, and we were able to, as I say, get about 75 students out of the camps, because this is one thing the go-government, or the Nimes committee had pushed for was Vichy, get people out of the camps, and into a more or less normal living.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="22"></span>  26 Interview with Tracy Strong June 11, 2009</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Chambon is also a Protestant village.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Chambon was very definitely a Protestant village.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I--I re -- of course, the conditions in the camp were always very mini -- minimum, and I think this was towards the end of -- or in "42, where the conditions -- the camp, you know, was on a beach, and the conditions around it weren't too great. Cold and windy and this particular time when I come back, I go and visit people in the c -- in the [indecipherable] or in the barracks. And -- and th-this time I went to the barracks, cause you could -- they had a real black market going on in every barrack, where if you wanted something special and you had money, you could get it. In other words chocolate, or extra bread or something. But this time I came back and people just looked worn out and tired and hungry, of course.

And there was not a thing we could do except just encourage them to try and make some plans, which was very difficult, I mean, plan what their life, I mean, have a goal of some kind. And they would just kind of pull the blankets up over them and just lie there. So those are conditions that, I don't know what anybody could have done to improve them [indecipherable] cause the food was [indecipherable], vegetables, nothing very substantial, it's one piece of bread, which made a very de -- very depressing visit.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was it reserved for the Cimade personnel?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Cima -- Cimade, all the personnel, whether Red Cross or others. So conditions in camps -- Rivesaltes was particularly depressing because of the heat, and the -- not sand, but kind of rock -- rocky soil. And overcrowded, of course. And then you never knew when there's gonna be another exodus, or -- then the Germans insisted that the Germans -- the Germans in the camp be sent back to Germany. It was kind of an interesting way in which -- I suppose about a hundred thousand Germans were sent to France, cause Hitler gave the -- the gauleiter, that is the heads of certain sections of Germany permission to just do what they wanted besides just get rid of the Jews. So the one near the French border in southwestern Germany, so it's simple, we'll just send them to France. So they shipped them all down to France, to Gurs, Rivesaltes, other camps.

Those pictures you saw were of a convoy being prepared, which was always a very dramatic time, because -- well, Andre Dumas, who was one of the head Cimade people in the camps, got to know the directors and the soldiers all much better than I did. And for one convoy he sat in with the director and decided who would -- I mean, not who would go, but whether there was a discrep -- whether families being separated. And he'd argue with the man, no you can't send her, because her husband's here, or vice-a-versa. And he tried --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did that work?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: What?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It worked -- it -- it -- it worked in that he was able to keep several families together, but also it took such a toll on him, cause if he took out one person, another person had to take their place. And Andre went oh -- decided he just couldn't morally do this any more.</p></p></dialogue>

The refugees didn't know for sure where they were going, I suppose they had some idea.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>But we'd already by then learned about Auschwitz, so the dilemma was, can we really decide that this person should not go, or should go? Now the director of the camp had to make the choice, but that was his job.</p><p> End of Tape One  <span class="page-break" number="28"></span>  Interview with Tracy Strong % June 11, 2009 Beginning Tape Two</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Going back to -- to our discussion about the state you found people in -- in -- in Rivesaltes, and the fact that when they're physically so weak and sick, that morally and intellectually, they have no -- no desire --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They have -- they no -- not only no desire, but no goal. As long as they had a goal, whether it was just to live another day or so, and they could see some hope in the future, I think that would encourage them to try and do something. But when they just kind of give up and see no future at all, then that's very depressing, not only for themselves, but for everybody else. Because there's really nothing you can do, you can't give them what they really need, is more food, because you don't have it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: At one point you talk about one of the meetings of the Committee de Nimes, and Dr. Vay(ph) gave his report. Do you remember? He was mentioning about, he was talking about the dire state of people in the camps, and in your diary you reflect on that, and you -- because he said that people were -- they tried helping them by giving them more food, or giving them shots, and they were too far gone. And that --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think a s -- I think a person reaches a point where they" ve lost interest.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did you question your beliefs, your religious faith, because of that? Did that make you reflect on what you had been studying, or --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, it makes you -- well, it certainly makes you reflect on what you're doing, whether there's anything else you can do. You can't give up hope on them, because then you've also gotten in the same situation that they're in. So it's a matter of maintaining your own spiritual feelings and beliefs, that there's gotta be a better place, and a better time. But you -- if you can't see any future, I mean, France was in a very sad situation, economically and e-every way. And I think I found that particularly true right -- right after the big debacle, the French couldn't realize what happened to them. They knew they had the biggest army in -- in Europe, and it just disappeared, dissolved.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You also mentioned that you were worried about the capacity to adapt of people who had been immigrating and moved around from place to place, and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: This was the difficulty, you would -- everybody wanted to get out, and not everybody would put in a request for an exit visa, or for a visa from -- and everybody had friends. Like there was one -- one person who was dif -- different -- di -- whose rel -- relative worked in the church office in New York, Dr. Forell(ph).</p></p></dialogue>

I said, well, if you can get him a visa, that the best thing you could do. Well, even with all his connections, he couldn't get a visa for her. So you had to tell a person, well, not now, but keep on hoping, keep -- so it was not surprising that people would try and walk out of the camp and head for the frontier.</p></p></dialogue>

But -- well, even, for instance, a person with an American passport, and a visa like Ronald Elliot, who was one of the leaders of the World Student Christian Federation, came to visit. This was before America was in the war, of course. And he had an exit permit, and wi -- so he came down to visit Rivesaltes, which is fairly near to the border. And we'd showed him around and spend the day or so with him showing him different parts of the camp and situation. Then he got on the train to go to Cerbere(ph), which is border into Spain, and was turned down for some reason, they didn't accept his exit visa. So he'd come back and we spent another day with him, put him on the train again, about three times before he finally got across. And he had all the papers he needed, but s-some folks in there along the way decided well, why should I let him go?

And being the good Swiss, she felt that was disgusting.</p><p>But that was typical of the camps, I mean, s-sol -- soldiers were not -- they were civilian guards, or soldiers, they just had no discipline at all. So you could -- in one way it was very easy to get in and out of the camp, another way you never knew when they were gonna crack down and make it more difficult.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: At one point you -- you mention even organizing activities for them because they seem to be bored.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, they were. I mean, who likes to stand at a gate for eight, 10 hours? It didn't work out too well, cause they'd come one time and then not show up for another month or so.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: At one point you mentioned looking for the Madagascarians, or the people from Madagascar.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="32"></span> </p><p> 36 Interview with Tracy Strong June 11, 2009</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Madagascar.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And could you tell me a little about them?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well see, this was a mil -- originally a military camp, and it was set up for troops in north Africa. The beginning of the war, they'd come and stay there, then go up to the fr -- to the front lines. And evidently these were Madagascarans who were in -- recruited to fight and then the war was over, so they didn't come. Eventually they came to work in the -- to work in the work camps. See, the Germans, or the French and Germans tried to put everybody -- every male, into work camp, cause there were so many soldiers who were still prisoners in euro -- in Germany, and they needed a lot of workers. In fact, some of our students were sent over to Brest, which was a big submarine base for the Germans, and worked in the foundations there for a while, until some colonel, German colonel found out they were Jewish and sent them back.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You mentioned in Marseilles somebody comes in and wants some workers from Rivesaltes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What did he want them to do?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Probably labor.</p></p></dialogue>

It's amazing when you take out a whole army of young men, how qui -- hard it is to get anything done.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You mentioned you remember when United States enters the war after Pearl Harbor, and you write in your diary on the ninth of December, 1941 that we've entered the war. And that is the beginning of a period of uncertainty for you, because you don't know if you'Il be able to continue your activities.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, we knew that the Germans were in control at Vichy, although not openly, and I'm sure they are not happy to see America come into the war, or the -- or in th -- in fact, for a while, as I recall, we, after Pearl Harbor, Japan declared war on us, and we declared war on Japan, but not on Germany for about a week or so. So --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You mentioned that you went into Les Milles and somebody told you that they had a --a secret radio.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah. I suppose every camp had some secret radios like that. They try and hide and so they get news long before we would. But that --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: What was your feeling when you heard that United States had entered the war?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I suppose like everybody else, kind of shocked. And then, course I started thinking whether we should really get out, or we could -- Lowrie, I know at one time, wanted to leave right away and go back to the States, he wanted to get involved in the war effort. And I guess he found out it wasn't that easy to get out as  <span class="page-break" number="34"></span> </p><p> 38 Interview with Tracy Strong June 11, 2009 quickly. Eventually he went to Switzerland, along with, I think, most of the other Americans who were working in one of the various organizations. But at the time we didn't know whether we're gonna be taken, put into camps, as the Americans in Germany were, of course were. But there they had the protection of the consulate, we had no protection at all. And we could have joined the people in the camps.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That was a serious consideration.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was, very definitely, whether we should try and leave while we still could.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you decided to stay on?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We decided to stay on, that we had a responsibility to work. And there was no, at the time there was no outward expression from the Germans [indecipherable] still unoccupied. I think the thing that took it off was the French navy was down in -- in the Mediterranean.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Toulon?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In Toulon. And the -- eventually, the Germans wanted the navy and the -- the French scuttled the ships, which was a big blow to the Germans. I think the German after that were -- were much more strict. And eventually they did just take over all of France.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And what happened at that point?</p></p></dialogue>

He showed me how to get across the barbed wire. Take your coat off, throw the coat over, then jump oh -- jump over, but I didn't have to do that, fortunately.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Let's go back a little. There was a point where the French were inspecting the camps. They had a man named Andre Jonfur(ph), who was from Vichy, and he was doing a report on the camps. Do you remember ever being present when there were Vichy officials visiting the camps?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, I must have been there at times, I don't recall any mention with them, or meeting them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: There was also a point where the German general Danika(ph) started visiting the camps. It was in July 1942. You -- do you have -- remember hearing about that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I remember hearing the Germans were coming to visit.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But you weren't present?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was anyone you know present, like Dumas or Lowrie?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, I-- Lowrie -- Lowrie didn't go into the camps too much. He -- that was the functionaries of the higher government.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Rivesaltes kept changing its disposition. Apparently they kept moving people from one ilo(ph) and barracks to another. And you mention that you had to change your barracks and your foyer. How -- do you know wh-why that happened?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think what -- the reason they moved the internees from one ilo(ph) to the other, they had certain ilos(ph) that they were getting ready to ship people out in, and they wanted to get them into a barracks all together.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you know that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, I knew that was the reason for their shifting them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But you shifted your foyer with them?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We didn't shi -- we didn't -- I don't think we shifted the foyer at all.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did you see any changes in the camp, was more barbed wire, or more -- or --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Not more barbed wire, but you could tell when a convoy was being organized, because everybody was more or less on their -- on edge and nervous about who was going, who wasn't going.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did that work? Were you -- you were present when they were starting to prepare the convoys?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You were still bringing in paper and paints and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Penci -- pencil --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- and musical instruments.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Right. We were trying to keep things going as simply as possible, but always behind, you know, in the background there was always this uncertainty about who was going to show up. And once they got into the ilo(ph) that was being evacuated or sent out, then they -- that was --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Do you remember which ilo(ph) it was?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't recall which one.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Do you remember who put the list together, it was the comman --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: The commandant -- well, the Germans would ask for say, 150 Jews, and the commandant would have to pick out 150 people to go.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were there times when you actually went and said -- you -- you told me you didn't want to be involved in the choice, but did you plead for somebody at one point?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I--I didn't, cause I was in a little different situation. The French could do it, because they were talking to Frenchmen. But I didn't feel it was my job as an  <span class="page-break" number="38"></span>  42 Interview with Tracy Strong June 11, 2009 American to get involved in it. And then the French eventually -- and the Cimade eventually, as I said before, Andre Dumas found out he just couldn't do it morally any more.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Do you -- you have a camera with you, and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Had a what?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- You have a camera with you at -- at some point.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Because there are pictures that were with your collection in -- in France, and they were pictures of the -- what we think are the deportation convoys. Do you remember how that was set up? You got up in the morning and all of a sudden people --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, you knew something was coming up, because people getting very nervous and uncertain. So when they actually started assembling people, get ready for the trucks, I think we all were in a very -- very near there with an open window. We couldn't go over to the ke -- to the convoy, of course, because the -- there were soldiers -- there were not a lot of soldiers around, there were soldiers around, but -- so that's when I took the pictures, from inside of the -- a window, about a hundred yards away.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was your motivation in taking the pictures? As some sort of proof that this was going on?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think just it was another event in the camp. Always a sad one, and discouraging one, but --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did people --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: --I happened to have my camera.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh they -- they were told to pack a suitcase, th-they have to carry it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were there children?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not many children, no, mostly adults. But there were families. Although by then I think most of the small children had been taken out by the Swiss Red Cross, or [indecipherable] enfant.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did the people -- were the people given anything to eat or drink while they were waiting?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't think so. I don't think they were fed --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: They waited all day without anything?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [ll say it didn't take too long, once they got them assembled, and just brought the trucks in and took them out.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not a very pleasant time, but th-th -- you always wonder well -- well, should we have done something, but then what -- what could you have done? You certainly could not revolt, or start a revolution.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were there people who -- who were saying goodbye and didn't --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yeah, because th-these were their friends. Most of the people had come together from Germany, and had shipped down here and known each other in  <span class="page-break" number="41"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Tracy Strong *8 June 11, 2009 Germany for years, maybe. And then for some reason one group was sent off -- sent back to Germany, and others was kept in the camp. And eventually the camp was -- I assume was completely liquidated.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You" re just talking about Rivesaltes?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, but that was after -- after I'd left, and after America was in the war. Now, the Spaniards were still there, had been there for oh, probably four or five years.</p><p>Could I take a quick break and stretch my -- my leg going to sleep. [break] You want to talk more about deportation?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember we were talking about how people were saying goodbye and they were -- were there -- was there ever a moment where somebody was on the truck, or ready to get on the truck and then they didn't go?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah, there were times like that, when people --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Can you describe that?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, it's always dramatic, because normally they tried to run things very smoothly, just put people on the truck and drive away. And then if at the last minute there's a change in people, like if somebody intervened, or if somebody else had called Vichy with a name of a person they wanted to take off, or -- and Vichy would respond to the camp, they'd have to take them off the truck.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And what could be some of the reasons that the person would be taken off?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="42"></span> Interview with Tracy Strong %deg June 11, 2009</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, who knows? Hard to say. They had enough influence to -- to get through to a minister in Vichy. It would take quite -- quite a deal of influence, but then many of these -- many of the Germans had been functionaires, had been important people in Berlin or in Germany, and may have known the French deputies, or some -- I mean, I -- I don't know what it was, but it could be any one -- any reason.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And when the person actually had to get off the truck?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Truck. Then there'd be somebody else who'd be put in their place, which was real dramatic cause they'd -- they'd say they cut [indecipherable] 150 people and stop there, the next 10 people in line would be sent back to the barracks, or be kept there until the trucks left, if they didn't have to change. So it's -- it was dra -- always dramatic and tragic time, cause you hate to see anybody -- anybody be taken away.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you know exactly where they were going? You knew they would go to the Rivesaltes train station, but did you know where they were headed after that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Up to Paris, I think it's in Drancy where the camp was, and they'd probably spend some time there, and then they go back to -- then they'd go to Germany.</p><p>Where they -- which camp they went to, Buchenwald or Auschwitz, wherever they -- or in some cases they were -- if they were young enough, they go back to Germany and they put them under work camps. Because Germany needed a --</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="43"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Tracy Strong " June 11, 2009 needed a lot of workers too with the whole army out of the country. So you couldn't -- you couldn't say for sure or not.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: At the end of the day, what was the atmosphere around the camp?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Very somber. Very quiet. Nobody really felt like doing anything, because you'd been pretty well drained just watching them leave. So what --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Was your religion any consolation?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They what?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was the Bible or religion any consolation?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't think so. I suppo -- I think there may have been a service of some kind, but not necessarily. No, it was more or less just a complete let down when you work with people for a number of months, and then some of them disappeared. I guess fortunately, we didn't know for sure where they were going.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How -- did you -- you were present at several of these events, of these deportations?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think only a couple.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you ever present in other camps when people were being sent on to this type of action?</p></p></dialogue>

Gurs and Rivesaltes were probably the two big camps for German -- German refugees. Vernet was more of a political -- political prisoners.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You also went to Noe and Recebedou?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Recebedou yes, I do remember those two well.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And Les Milles?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Les Milles was right next to Marseilles and -- and that was a more hopeful camp, cause that's where they were -- those who had their first papers in order and had to get more papers would ca -- go to Les Milles cause then they go into Marseilles, see the consulates and work on getting their final papers together, so that was a-- much more of a transient camp, even though very active with artists and -- and a library.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When you knew that the -- you -- you were present at two of these convoys, did you find out when others were going to occur?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't recall, I don't think so, no way. I don't think anybody knew because the germ -- Germans would make the decision, we need 150 or 200 or 300.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But every time you went back, you weren't sure the people you knew would still be there.</p></p></dialogue>

I knew they had a good --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You did see them?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I did see them, and knew they had a good organization going. And they were -- I think they were mainly interested in trying to get these wer -- young people into some kind of a job work, or training for jobs.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And also the children.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Very much so, cause the Spaniards had been there for about three years, three or four years, since the end of the Spanish revolution, and they'd pretty much settled in and made their own position there in the camp.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="46"></span> Interview with Tracy Strong *deg June 11, 2009</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did they have more freedom than the others?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I'd say they did because they'd been there longer, and they knew the way around. And th-they had no place to go either, they were -- they weren't too welcome in France, but there -- on the other hand, they took care of them, the French.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did they have the same rations as the rest of the people in the camp?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They must have had more, because they did their own cooking. I think I mentioned once that they invited me over to dinner, and they cooked Spanish rice on an open fire out in the middle of the camp. And served a very good dinner, which I appreciated. Food was pretty much a central thought in everybody's mind all the time. But -- so when you had a good meal, then the -- made a lot of difference.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: French, yeah. They'd learned enough French by then to get by.

They had more energy than the Germans, because they had, I suppose, better food that they prepared themselves. But, course they wanted -- they didn't want to get too settled in France, because they wanted to go back to Spain eventually after Franco left. But tha -- they didn't see any future, because they c -- they knew they couldn't go back to France -- to Spain without being put in prison or shot.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you in contact with any of the other populations? There were Roma in the camps.</p></p></dialogue>

Did you set up shop in -- in one of the barracks and say come in and talk to me?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, there are people you knew, having been there, and then the local French committees also would recommend students. Once in awhile there'd be a French student that needed help, or needed to get out, get away. So the local committee would do -- run across students who needed help. Cause see, we were there to work with all students, not just internees or refugees.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, first you had to get the release from the camp, which means you had to prove that there was a place for them to go, and that they would be -- not become a charge to the state.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And who could give you that release? The commandant du camp?</p></p></dialogue>

They'd already had a -- a border trip to Switzerland, so they knew -- well, most of them knew, pretty much, how to get around. And the train service wasn't too bad, it was slow, so they arrived pretty much on their own.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And the first -- the first students that you took into Les Roches was -- that was probably around February "42?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think -- yeah, that's when the bulk of students seemed to have come, but there had been some there a little earlier, once the camp had opened.

But interned them up -- then the Swiss tourism office was very dull in Switzerland there. Two Germans come in, but nobody else, so the hotels were empty, so the Swiss put them up in a nice big hotel up in -- oh, what's it called? Up in the mountains.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Pretty much so. Not as much as I thought, cause I'd been in touch with Americans all along, and I'd been in the army long enough to realize that what I miss were all the little things that you forget about.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: For example?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh, about TVs. We didn't have a TV for a couple of years, so -- for a number of years.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: At one point in your diary you are at a meeting of the Committee de Nimes, and you've heard one of the dire reports that Dr. Vay(ph) gave about malnutrition and -- and you ha -- you reflect upon what -- that you thought man was intrinsically good, but maybe the cruelty and the absurdity that you saw around you shook you.

And one of the questions after this [indecipherable] group of students who said, well, can the Holocaust ever happen again? The only thing I can say wi -- look, there's enough -- enough -- enough problems already, wa -- like dur -- like all in the middle -- in the Middle East and Serbia, crises like that, in north Africa. And I'm not sure we settled all those yet. I ju-just hope that it never can happen again on such a schedu -- scale.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When you mentioned being able to perhaps not change everything, but work with individuals, there's a sense of -- of hope and satisfaction when you finally get some of those students out of Rivesaltes to the Chambon.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, that was -- that was a big step, cause we worked so long and hard we -- for it, and then failed the first time to get the nod and then went back a second time. But I think when you see people actually in the situation where they're changing their lives, which it was, cause they could just as well have been on a convoy. Except they were all young, they would probably not go on to a camp, they'd go on to a work camp someplace. But there's some satisfaction to know that you helped a few  <span class="page-break" number="66"></span>  70 Interview with Tracy Strong June 11, 2009 people like that.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You remained in contact with Hans Solomon(ph), or did you find that you connect with him again in Chambon-sur-Lignon in 2004?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I saw him then and then I saw him earlier this year in Philadelphia. So it was kind of pleasant to get back there and talk with him.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When you started writing your diary and it seemed mostly destined to -- for your parents, sometimes you even write to your mother and dad. Were you conscious that you were living in extraordinary times and that you had to get it down, because you were actually in the midst of something exceptional?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, I felt -- first, my letters to my parents, we've always corresponded. And I felt if I could at least open up with somebody, and give them some sense of my feelings and my beliefs, that would help -- help to go on to continue with the work.</p><p>And the diary I just felt [indecipherable] this is a special time, and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You mentioned that sometimes you felt lonely, and that you would like to come back and have somebody to talk to at night.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you realized that to accomplish something you needed to be part of a group.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You mentioned coming in to one of the camps, for example Gurs, and talking with a student who -- his name was Max, and he was so appreciative of the fact that you took time to talk to him. He was working in the kitchen. So you were aware of that, you wrote it down, that every human being needs to be recognized.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, I think you begin to realize that people want to share, and always need somebody they can open up to, and can talk to, and felt that through education there was a possibility of helping people realize what they want to do. It becomes a very personal thing after a while, looking for a warm contact with people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You must have established it with your students, if you stayed on and -- for 25 years in one school, and -- and probably there was an exchange there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, I still have friends among the students that I knew. But also realize that a lot of the work in education is very temporary, and that you don't -- I mean, every day is not a major day. A lot of days are very routine and that you have to get used to it. You try and break out of the routine and make a difference in people's lives.</p></p></dialogue>
