I was five, my sister was seven or eight, and my brother was 10 or 11. And my father indicated that if we're going to work in a world's organization, he should see something of the Orient. So we sailed out of Seattle in November 1923 on the -- one of the princess ships, and went, actually, practically all the way around the world in six months. As I think back on that, must -- and have traveled with my own children, here were three young children and my mother taking care of us all the way around the world. We went first to Japan, and got there just after the big earthquake in Japan in 1923. Then M-Moncton(ph), Manchuria, China, Hong Kong. Then around through India, up through the Suez Canal, went over to Palestine, and eventually to Venice, an-and arrived in Geneva in April 1924. Which was quite a trip. So we settled into Geneva, which was then a much smaller town that it is now, but also a very international town, because a lot of international organizations were there, including the international Red Cross, and then many of the other youth-serving or people- serving organizations.</p></p></dialogue>

Anyway, they went there, went to international school for a year or so, and eventually came back to this country for two ye -- my father thought I should learn English, so I came back for two years to a high school in Bainbridge Islands, Washington, and finished high school there.</p><p>Then I was 16, at which time I felt I was a little too young for college, and as he and my mother were traveling a great deal for the y -- world's YMCA, I went to school in Germany, Deutsche Jugend -- Jugendhof, which was 1932. And if you remember your history well, that was the time that Hitler came to power, in 1933.</p><p>So I went through that whole time of the change in regime and cha -- and heard Hitler speak twice, big rallies. And then at the end of the year, went back to Ohio -- Oberlin College, Ohio, where I spent four years and got my bachelor's degree, 1937. At that time I wasn't quite sure what I wanted to do, a chance of working in the YMCA, or in the church. So I went to Yale Divinity School for three years in New Haven, Connecticut. In 19 grad -- got my da -- my master's degree in divinity and it was in 1940, first war had already started in Europe, and my father had headed up the war -- war prisoner's aid of the YMCA, which was approved in the Geneva Convention, that international Red Cross took care of the physical problems of the prisoners on ev-every country, and the YMCA took care of their This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Had to take a boat from New York to Lisbon, then across Spain where we got -- just at the time France had fallen, so everything was closed down, so we were stuck in Barcelona for several weeks. And then eventually the group went across southern France and up the Rhone Valley to Geneva. And went originally to work with the European Student Relief fund, which was an organization made up of the three student serving organizations. The World Student Christian Federation, the Protestants. The Pax Romana, the Catholics, NISS, a neutral organization. And our job was to do for stu -- university students what the YMCA was doing for the general population. So we singled out students in camps in every country. I did go to Germany for about six months, to work in the prisoner of war camp, and visited Stalag 16, I think it was, and 17, one section of Germany. The ma -- most of the prisoners were either French or British, Polish. A few ru -- quite a few Russians eventually, which now This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

See, in the camps, particularly the officers" camps, the officers were not allowed to work. They had nothing to do except organize activities. So the YMCA brought in books, sporting material, violins, anything to keep them occupied during their imprisonment. So I'd go the -- there were about, I suppose, 15 camps that I visited off and on in the fall of 1941.</p><p>Eventually -- course, America wasn't in the war yet, but in 1941 I went back to Geneva. The Germans would not let me go in the camps any more, they thought I had helped a prisoner escape, which was the last thing in the world I would have done. So the Germans went and closed the camps to me.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Spiritual, phy -- whatever physical support we could give.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You mentioned the Russian choir in your diary? Do you remember meeting a group of Russians?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [remember very vaguely that a group of Russians -- they were mainly though Russians who'd left Russia during the revolution. So they were what you call the white Russians, who had settled in Paris, with a large colony of them in Paris, and with the rest of the French they left the north and came south. So my work was primarily centered in Marseilles, I lived at the Hotel Terminus, and then we'd travel regularly to different camps.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You mentioned traveling with Donald Lowrie, can you talk a little about Lowrie? He sounded as if he were an interesting person.</p></p></dialogue>

But Don was also the head of what they called the Nimes committee, which was a committee of all the various private organizations: the Red Cross; Unitarian; Quakers; OSE, Jewish organization. And they met once a month in Nimes, so it became known as the Nimes committee, to coordinate their efforts, and then to intervene. And Don would go to Vichy to talk to the representatives of the government in Vichy about permission to do certain things.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: For example?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, one thing that happened was be able to get the refugees out of the camps, if they could support themselves, so that Vichy government did finally approve that.</p><p>Whereas if an organization would provide for them so the state didn't pay anything, they could get them out of the camps, or a prisoner of private means could get out of the camps.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember going to Vichy with him?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember some of the people from the Jewish organizations? Did you remember Raoul -- Raymond-Raoul Lambert?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I can't say that I do remember them. I met them all, of course, and knew them, but that's a long time ago.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: At one point you mention that the Vichy government creates a -- an official state organization for all Jewish organizations, Ugeef(ph), u-g-i-f.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: A Swiss doctor, I think. I just by chance met him because I travel a good deal, and meet a lot of people.</p></p></dialogue>

I remember especially one session where Lowrie asked for a criticism of the committee, or recommendation, what we could do to improve, and it was very open, everybody put in their two cents worth, but very -- very open discussion. Praise for Lowrie as president, because his was a difficult job to bring them together, and get them to work together and go in one voice to Vichy. Vichy was not too cooperative. I think Vichy was not thought of very much by the French themselves. They knew it was under the control of the Germans, that Petain, Laval had very little of independence.</p></p></dialogue>

And why was that?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, he -- well, he was a very active person, and had connections all over southern France, and had lived in France, of course, before, so he knew the French.

And he couldn't do anything really to change the camps, but he could call to attention any discrepancies or any errors, or anything that were happening in the camps.

There's a big difference between Germany and France, and of course Germany was taking all the food, except the fruits.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>France was a very rich agricultural country, of course, especially in the south, a lot of fruits and vegetables, so we survived pretty much on [indecipherable] and -- [indecipherable] and asparagus.

Whether it was healthcare, or whether improve foods, or take care of people in prisons, whereas the French were much more intellectual in their approach, and -- and the French loved to discuss, and to talk, a-argue -- very pleasantly, but also very intellectually, and I find -- I found that they were way ahead of us as far -- intellectually as different ideas, which, even though I'd had theological training, I was not ready to discuss in such detail as the French were.</p></p></dialogue>

And we figured we had to get the students into an atmosphere where they could really continue their studies. We looked over southern France, and a Mr. Guillome(ph) who was a -- worked for the -- a Frenchman who worked for the YMCA, been mayor of a little town Chambon-sur-Lignon [indecipherable] and so we went up to see Chambon, which is very up in the mountains, and a very rural area, and found out that they had a treme -- there are two pastors there, Pastor Truckmay(ph) and Pastor try -- Tise(ph), who are very much the leaders of the community, and they had already had a number of maison d'enfants open at the Swiss Red Cross, that a couple may -- where they could bring children and take care of them during that -- in that manner.

Cold and windy and this particular time when I come back, I go and visit people in the c -- in the [indecipherable] or in the barracks.

And then you never knew when there's gonna be another exodus, or -- then the Germans insisted that the Germans -- the Germans in the camp be sent back to Germany. It was kind of an interesting way in which -- I suppose about a hundred thousand Germans were sent to France, cause Hitler gave the -- the gauleiter, that is the heads of certain sections of Germany permission to just do what they wanted besides just get rid of the Jews. So the one near the French border in southwestern Germany, so it's simple, we'll just send them to France. So they shipped them all down to France, to Gurs, Rivesaltes, other camps.

That's when the convoys started.

And for one convoy he sat in with the director and decided who would -- I mean, not who would go, but whether there was a discrep -- whether families being separated.

<dialogue class=""><p>But we'd already by then learned about Auschwitz, so the dilemma was, can we really decide that this person should not go, or should go?

As long as they had a goal, whether it was just to live another day or so, and they could see some hope in the future, I think that would encourage them to try and do something. But when they just kind of give up and see no future at all, then that's very depressing, not only for themselves, but for everybody else.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did you question your beliefs, your religious faith, because of that?

You can't give up hope on them, because then you've also gotten in the same situation that they're in. So it's a matter of maintaining your own spiritual feelings and beliefs, that there's gotta be a better place, and a better time. But you -- if you can't see any future, I mean, France was in a very sad situation, economically and e-every way. And I think I found that particularly true right -- right after the big debacle, the French couldn't realize what happened to them. They knew they had the biggest army in -- in Europe, and it just disappeared, dissolved.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You also mentioned that you were worried about the capacity to adapt of people who had been immigrating and moved around from place to place, and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: This was the difficulty, you would -- everybody wanted to get out, and not everybody would put in a request for an exit visa, or for a visa from -- and everybody had friends.

I said, well, if you can get him a visa, that the best thing you could do. Well, even with all his connections, he couldn't get a visa for her. So you had to tell a person, well, not now, but keep on hoping, keep -- so it was not surprising that people would try and walk out of the camp and head for the frontier.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh, some were caught, I mean the -- I don't know how many hundreds had tried to get across. But -- well, even, for instance, a person with an American passport, and a visa like Ronald Elliot, who was one of the leaders of the World Student Christian Federation, came to visit. This was before America was in the war, of course. And he had an exit permit, and wi -- so he came down to visit Rivesaltes, which is fairly near to the border. And we'd showed him around and spend the day or so with him showing him different parts of the camp and situation. Then he got on the train to go to Cerbere(ph), which is border into Spain, and was turned down for some reason, they didn't accept his exit visa. So he'd come back and we spent another day with him, put him on the train again, about three times before he finally got across. And he had all the papers he needed, but s-some folks in there along the way decided well, why should I let him go? So -- This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And being the good Swiss, she felt that was disgusting.</p><p>But that was typical of the camps, I mean, s-sol -- soldiers were not -- they were civilian guards, or soldiers, they just had no discipline at all.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well see, this was a mil -- originally a military camp, and it was set up for troops in north Africa. The beginning of the war, they'd come and stay there, then go up to the fr -- to the front lines. And evidently these were Madagascarans who were in -- recruited to fight and then the war was over, so they didn't come. Eventually they came to work in the -- to work in the work camps. See, the Germans, or the French and Germans tried to put everybody -- every male, into work camp, cause there were so many soldiers who were still prisoners in euro -- in Germany, and they needed a lot of workers. In fact, some of our students were sent over to Brest, which was a big submarine base for the Germans, and worked in the foundations there for a while, until some colonel, German colonel found out they were Jewish and sent them back.</p></p></dialogue>

Eventually he went to Switzerland, along with, I think, most of the other Americans who were working in one of the various organizations. But at the time we didn't know whether we're gonna be taken, put into camps, as the Americans in Germany were, of course were. But there they had the protection of the consulate, we had no protection at all. And we could have joined the people in the camps.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That was a serious consideration.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Let's go back a little. There was a point where the French were inspecting the camps.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Rivesaltes kept changing its disposition. Apparently they kept moving people from one ilo(ph) and barracks to another. And you mention that you had to change your barracks and your foyer. How -- do you know wh-why that happened?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think what -- the reason they moved the internees from one ilo(ph) to the other, they had certain ilos(ph) that they were getting ready to ship people out in, and they wanted to get them into a barracks all together.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you know that?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Truck.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Les Milles was right next to Marseilles and -- and that was a more hopeful camp, cause that's where they were -- those who had their first papers in order and had to get more papers would ca -- go to Les Milles cause then they go into Marseilles, see the consulates and work on getting their final papers together, so that was a-- much more of a transient camp, even though very active with artists and -- and a library.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Very much so, cause the Spaniards had been there for about three years, three or four years, since the end of the Spanish revolution, and they'd pretty much settled in and made their own position there in the camp.</p><p>This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I'd say they did because they'd been there longer, and they knew the way around.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did they have the same rations as the rest of the people in the camp?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They must have had more, because they did their own cooking. I think I mentioned once that they invited me over to dinner, and they cooked Spanish rice on an open fire out in the middle of the camp. And served a very good dinner, which I appreciated.

They had more energy than the Germans, because they had, I suppose, better food that they prepared themselves. But, course they wanted -- they didn't want to get too settled in France, because they wanted to go back to Spain eventually after Franco left. But tha -- they didn't see any future, because they c -- they knew they couldn't go back to France -- to Spain without being put in prison or shot.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you in contact with any of the other populations? There were Roma in the camps.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not too much, they had their own life pretty much, so -- and again, they were -- di-didn't have to stay, they could move out if they wanted. But again, they'd have to earn -- earn the living someplace, and like in most countries, they were never fully integrated into the population.

Once in awhile there'd be a French student that needed help, or needed to get out, get away. So the local committee would do -- run across students who needed help. Cause see, we were there to work with all students, not just internees or refugees.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, first you had to get the release from the camp, which means you had to prove that there was a place for them to go, and that they would be -- not become a charge to the state.</p></p></dialogue>

They'd already had a -- a border trip to Switzerland, so they knew -- well, most of them knew, pretty much, how to get around. And the train service wasn't too bad, it was slow, so they arrived pretty much on their own.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And the first -- the first students that you took into Les Roches was -- that was probably around February "42?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think -- yeah, that's when the bulk of students seemed to have come, but there had been some there a little earlier, once the camp had opened.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, I think you begin to realize that people want to share, and always need somebody they can open up to, and can talk to, and felt that through education there was a possibility of helping people realize what they want to do.
