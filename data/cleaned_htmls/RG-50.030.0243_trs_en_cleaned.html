<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And where was that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Kielce, a city in Poland.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What part of Poland was it?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can you tell me a little bit about your family, your parents, your siblings?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My...I had one sister, a younger sister. My father's family came from , a town near Krakow. They were quite, you know, as you know Poland was a very...a few upper and the majority were kind of struggling for life through the hard life. My family worked.

My grandfather gave the same amount and this was very unique, and sure enough, after two years they lost all the money because they gave it to an uncle, to the bank, and the bank failed, so they lost everything and...but my father started later a trucking business. He was very successful and I remember till 1939 we were in the trucking business. He had trucks all over Poland.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can you tell me about the the kind of schools you went to when you were growing up?</p></p></dialogue>

I mean not...I don't know if I can explain to you...it's not rabbis like we say here.</p><p> It's something like rabbis. You heard probably about that...that type, so naturally the family was very orthodox but as the generation go down, it was a little bit less, you know, and I went to . My mother was was so...my mother went to college. In that time <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> have...when we run away so fast we didn't no clothing, no nothing. We...when you live everyday...she went back and that time when other people went back to Poland to to come back but she never got to and she couldn't because they closed the borders, the <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> very extensive. We had over three hundred people in Poland, the family, very known from...the majority were well-off. It was so well-off that nobody came to America because we said we don't, we don't need it and we had it...they had a good life in Europe. Usually when people didn't a life, they couldn't make a living there, they went to America. That was the trend in Europe at that time. I had a cousin which was a son from a very wealthy family.</p><p> They had a textile business, and he was the black sheep and he was the chief of the Communist Party and...not the chief of the Communist Party as such but the chief of Poland for the help NORP (ph) it was called, N - O - R - P, help for the prisoners of capitalists.</p><p>Alright. He was an idealist and it just...it so happened...I don't know if this is something relevant to the case but attests a moral story to it which I would like to say. And he was put up the Red flag in the Polish parliament. That's how devoted he was, but he was an intellectual and he got ten years in there, _a real prison, Poland. When he was in Kielce and I was nine years old, nobody was in our house in Kielce and I remember he came...they let him out because they were helping him in prison. They let him out, and they said that he came in and four fellows carrying the books after him, you know. He had so many books from prison because he came...they let him out unexpectedly and he was grateful because his brothers came over to us to bring food to the prisoner. The prison was a dungeon. People were dying there from the wetness, you know, from...there were underground wetness and they they put them in there not to live. He was there ten years but being that they were rich, they bribed the authorities. They went out sooner. And this cousin came to to Lemberg and he became the director of the biggest textile store and at that time it was...you see in Russia you couldn't...if you worked, you could work a whole month and not earn for bread. You were hungry, but if you had a F , you could live two months. Do you understand? And he was the director of the biggest biggest...is this...is this relevant or not?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Go ahead.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I'll tell you why it was relevant. You will find out if I...he he was so dedicated but he was so disappointed. While he was there, with the Russian system, with the Communists, while he was sitting that he went out of his way...he took us in, you know, it was a line...people stay there three days...he took us in because me and my father, without the line, without waiting, two times a day. That's how we lived. We got ten yards of material. We sold it, but this was against his whole principle. He went to jail for that. He would have never done before the war because he was through and through and dedicated. Why was he disappointed?</p><p>Communism is __. Because all his friends what were sitting in jail, the rations put to</p><p> . They told him...this is not hearsay but I heard it when I walked with my father and I have a good memory and I heard it when he was telling my father this, that they told them that we don't need Communism from Poland. If you're a good Communist, you should have stayed there and fight the Fascists. See Communists at that time didn't want, they didn't</p><p> because they were too smart, too wised up. Western Communists are no good, see. <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes...but I I was...he returned to Po...to Germany to...he was so...that's what I wanted to say.</p><p>He returned and the Germans killed him in a month, a horrible way. That's was one thing what I wanted to...in memory to him because he helped us in death. That's was...he hated so much __ that he returned to to...then the Germans hunt him right away and they killed him in a most horrible way and that finishes the story. OK. We were in Lvow. We registered.</p><p>The Russians came, one day in 1941...sometimes I can...you understand the ..and they took all the Jews what registered to go back. They had a list and they took them to Siberia because they they were disappointed. How can people go back to Germany when we are living in paradise already? My father and my sister and I, we had a friend was worked uh a district attorney and he was a Party man and we were in his house hiding and they came in to look for us. They asked him, are you...do you have any foreigners here? He said no. And he was hiding...he showed his card and they let...they didn't look. In a way that minute it was lucky but it wasn't because otherwise maybe they would survived. Of course you never know what's happening. It was a time that you never knew what is right and what is wrong, what you're doing is good, what you're doing is bad, so we left, but whoever was...after when they took away all those people in tra...in in in trains without food, without that...they took them to Siberia. Whoever was left and he was a foreigner, they gave him a passport. They couldn't live hundred miles from the border, so we moved back to Tuchin. That's how we stayed back to Tuchin. We lived in Tuchin till 1942. That's why...then the Germans came in, naturally in 1941 and my father didn't...in Tuchin was a factory. Should I go now to Tuchin? In Tuchin was a factory which by our standards was very small, but in 1942 the Germans were freezing already near Stalingrad that time. Their clothes...they didn't have prepared themselves and we were making...in that factory they were making wool. You know, they have the sheep. They took...then they were making heavy material, so the Germans grabbed those things and that factory was a was two engineers. One was Gros (ph) and they were , from Lodz, which they were textile engineers and they were running <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Excuse me. Did you work with Gros or...?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I worked, yeah, and I did certain things, but I was young, you know, so I...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Like like a go-for (ph)?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. Right. The...I was with him every day because it was small and I...he talked to me and in there it was Gros and there was another engineer which he wasn't that active. Gros was a great personality. He...he was dynamic. He was ___ and he was uncorruptible which was very rare. He didn't want to get rich, because at other times we had in different places that whoever was on the ruler, you know, they tried to...he didn't care. He was through and through a genuine to help, to help. There was also a director, a secre...an accountant, the main accountant which was Jewish. He he graduate from Berlin and the German made him a false Deutch (ph), which the only time what I heard that the Germans made a Jew a German, because they needed him and he spoke beautiful German. They were so impressed with him, they told him you are a German. But through and through he...he stayed away from...he wasn't that friendly. It didn't change but he was natural you know, and actually he was a false Deutsch (ph). You know what a false Deutch is?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Why don't you explain that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: A false Deutsch means that he was a German but he was not born in Germany but he was from the German nation. All the Germans what lived out of Germany are considered false Deutsh. That's what also the things that Hitler wanted to take all the land till Slovakia (ph) and that's wherever a German lived, he said they're false Deutsch. They belong to Germany.</p><p> That's called a false...false is nation, a national German or in other words. OK. So we lived there. The city...there was over three thousand people because other people came from all over, from Tuchin, and we were kind of privileged, the whole city, because of that factory.</p><p>We got more food, that the ghetto was not built right away, but I remember in 1942...I don't remember the date...Gros said Herman, let's go. We're going to...to Rovno We came to Rovno. Before we came into the outskirts of Rovno, five German SS...I'm talking about ____. I think it was...more or less I recognized, you know, came over and they stopped the car. It was a chauffeur, me, and Gros and somebody else. Are you Herr Gros? He said yes.</p><p> You have behaved from "Fuhrer, from __, , you should go back to Tuchin.</p><p>You can't get in to the city. He asked why, you know, because he felt with the Germans very, very open, very , because he knew the the top. So they said don't ask questions. <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> Poland. In Poland where the where the Germans were from the beginning, they put people to concentration camps, to arbeits lagers (ph) but where the Russians were, they abused older Jews, all the Jews were ninety percent under Communist, they are Jews of the old Communists, and they they very rarely took them to camps or to work, but they were mass murdered. They not...not even crematoriums, but they killed them...the open graves. They took Ukrainians and the Ukrainians did the killings. We came back and about a few weeks later I was in the office in the factory and they said there's some high Germans coming in to inspect the factory. Well, I was there because, you know, I was young so I could get in any place and I was sitting in a side and he came in and he introduced himself. It was...Gros was there, the other engineer and that false Deutsh, their accountant, and I was there...nobody else. And came in and said Reichsminister (ph) Rosenberg (ph), Alfred Rosenberg. I knew who Alfred Rosenberg was. Everybody knew. I knew him actually from the Nuremburg laws because he was the one what started the whole trouble. I didn't know...there was another guy. Alfred Rosenberg was slim. I remember him just like now, and the other fellow was Erich Koch. Erich Koch was the from Prussia. I don't know if you know what the is. The was the government and Erich Rosenberg said that I just got a promotion from the Fuhrer that I am now the minister (ph) of all the territories what we took and at that time Germans was the height. They were up to Moscow and to Leningrad.</p><p>It was 1942. I'm the of all the territories what we took from the from the Russians.</p><p>Actually ; , east, OK. So he was the the main man, and they were talking what they can produce and how . Very, very cordial to to Gros and very...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you were there in the room?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I was there and sitting there, but I remembered what they did, what they do in . It's very hard to explain but as I'm sitting now, and I was fifteen years old, I thought and I was wondering if I would have a grenade, I would kill myself and I would kill Rosenberg and Gros and Koch and all of them in the house, if I could have it. This was just a childish way, but the bitterness what what I held from Rovno. They killed twenty-two Jews and and from Lemberg. You lived every day, but this was just, you know, something...a dream what a child can can dream, I would do that. It's even foolish to repeat but I'm repeating it what my thoughts were at that time, and while I was there, Gros said...this I remember...Herr Rosenberg, Herr Mini...Herr Mini... Herr Reichsminister...that's how they...I remember the word...Herr Reichsminister, . Weare very productive Jews. This was the <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: All the way. Yes. Jewish and Jewish. He had a Jewish girlfriend. He was married to a Jewish , and he never knew that he was going to be involved...he was a...the time put him in he was an engineer from from Lodz, that time put him in to made...to be a leader, todo, buthe was from and__--_s, the _--, you know to a Jewish cause. He was not just a Jewish but he worked for the Germans, but this is...he wanted to save and he he wanted to save himself too, but being that he was the the whole...the whole , you know, the the key from the factory and with the Germans it's if you went to the higher echelon you could talk to them. It was just like uh said...whoever's a Jew, II decide. You understand.</p><p>So when you talk to them, even if it was Rosenberg, the biggest murderer, or Koch, but if you were sitting with them, you talked like I'm talking with you. But he also said, they said Herr Gros, and this was the true words what I heard, . I'm sorry to tell you...see <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> let's not die because we knew in Rovno they took them to the grave and they shot one by one. Let's kill as many Germans as we can. Let's burn the city.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Had you or anyone uh seen these mass murders in Rovno or you just heard about them?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: People...if you saw them, you didn't hear about them. You understand? We came...we came to...the closest I can say whoever worked with the mass murderers in Rovno was like me and Gros sitting there, two miles away from the mass murders, and he said they're killing Jews and then we saw the graves. And then we saw there's no...see we went to Rovno later.</p><p>There were graves but there was no Jews, so if you saw them, you didn't talk about them.</p><p>You understand? Because there was no way to escape. Does this answer your question?</p><p>You couldn't...you couldn't be there and escape because they were surrounded. We were talked about it and there were...you see, there was not only Germans. The problem was the Ukrainians were worse than the Germans. They made sure that nobody should escape. You could escape from a a wagon, from a train, but you couldn't escape if they surrounded you and they and they have mass...mass that you couldn't escape. There was no escape, not one to my knowledge. But we saw the graves later. I saw it where where they killed...it took place. We saw...this I saw before...the day before Yom Kippur that the Ukrainians were building right... not far. We could look...start digging graves. They didn't take any Jews to dig. Normally they took Jews to dig graves, but we, the three thousand people, very strong, very healthy because we had a good life till then, through the factory and through Gros" influence, we're not starving. Normally, the Germans starved that the people didn't have the strength to fight, to to resist. They starved them out slowly, slowly that they lost their fight.</p><p>We were strong and healthy, not hungry, so when you have strength, you fight. You understand? You don't...you do whatever you could because you still have strength. That was the only difference and we saw that they're building graves and the day before Yom Kippur I remember I went out and I and I opened...it was a beautiful day I remember and I said it's so gorgeous. It's so beautiful. I'm fifteen years old and I have...and I have to die in this grave. I kept...I...a day before Yom Kippur, my father came into the factory, to the ghetto. This I remember...they asked him why do you come back. Why do you come back?</p><p> So he said, I want to be with my children. I...me and my...] and my sister were were in the ghetto and then that they surrounded. You couldn't go out already. Before we could. Took away the passes, you know, the last day we couldn't get back, but in...they let in, so he didn't have to come but he came back. Naturally some fathers, you know, a father is a father. He wanted to come back. So we were talking, the the . We knew they're digging graves <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 0 Couldn't find anybody. It was already fire, burning, yelling, people were burning, and the the Germans used a wooden gate. They didn't have to build a strong gate around the ghetto because there was...the ghetto was only short time that they had it from wood, so we had to run, to run away. I kept the bottles and whoever was right there, the Germans were there.</p><p>We start throwing, throwing. Then the Germans start...this I saw, the Germans start burning the face. You know, when you...ashes when you get in face, it's not so pleasant, you know, but we knew that we can't, so what they did, they regrouped, and they got in one side with the machine guns. They saw that they can't do it and and it was also the order the first thing to burn the synagogue, the corn and the wheat. This was...if you have to die, let the food burn. Let them not...let them starve, you know, and our mind this was the the whole salvation because if if you if you think you catch...they say a razor blade, you know, even if you cut yourself. This was so far what we were talking to burn the the...nothing we could do. We were...we were defenseless. So I remember that I walked...while they were shooting from one side I walked to the other side. I don't know if it's northeast...I I don't know...and I, with this arm yet I pushed...and the hundreds of people with me, we pushed the the gate.</p><p> The gate fell down. Then the gate fell down and we had to climb it. We started running.</p><p>People started running, but when we start running, there was a Jewish cemetery. Usually the ghetto was right and the Jewish cemetery was on on the hill. The Germans, they were shooting but the bullets mostly hit the stone. Whoever fell, fell. Mostly they didn't do much but because they hit the stone. You know, we were after that...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So the gravestones gave you cover?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The gravestones gave us cover. Otherwise nobody would have survived because they were standing there and we were on top. The gravestones gave us cover and I knew when I...I can recall even now when I was running I knew every minute I would be hit from the back, but the stones...just you hear bouncing, you know, bouncing bullets. It was...and here the whole city was already...was burning. The whole ghetto was one, one big fire. Whoever could run, tun. I was looking...my mother...while I was running...you see over there woods were...mostly wooded area. We were running to the woods. It was about ten kilometers, but I got in in in the place where we lived was a family Constant...from Constantinople...Constanople. A father...his name was Kagan (ph), and he had a daughter my age, a real pretty girl I remember, you know, and he said, while we were...they run away from their ghetto to us, so we knew each other and three other fellows what they knew Kagan. I couldn't find my sister and and father so I was with them, and we were running together, and we run into the woods. To the woods, it was very...not woods, you know, maybe two, two miles and those part, two mile woods was nothing because there were five hundred mile woods later, further up, you know. Big woods going into Russia. Those are still wild country, you know, with woods. In the morning...it was already in the morning because we started later. We woke there and then we saw that we were quite a big amount of people and we got Kagan...I was the youngest so with with the girl was Kagan and the all three but there were three brothers. Said this is not the place to stay. The Germans will come tomorrow and they will kill us all because there's no place here.

See, I was already torn up. My clothes were torn up so they looked...I knew already that I looked...even I didn't look what they called the Jewish look. You understand? I never looked, you know, but when you are depressed, when you are turned up, at that time you you looked strange, you knew that you are a Jew right away.</p><p>You understand? In a normal society maybe they wouldn't...they wouldn't recognize because I didn't have...I didn't never looked typical. You understand what they thought in Europe.</p><p>You understand...to be short and then I was tall. You understand? So I didn't have that...the typical look so they told me . So I said you must be Russian partisans. So I said how do you know, they asked. I knew if they would say , they are Ukrainian partisans or Germans, butifthey say ___, this was...that much I knew but I couldn't tell them that so I said Germans look so fat because the Germans in the villages, you know, what they had...what they call...we didn't see the Germans in the army. They were fat, you know, from the peasant...peasant German. You understand? And you look skin...slim so they were laughing and they liked me, so I said to them, look that he killed. I told them the story and I'm here alone and I would like to fight in the partisans. So they said sorry, but we don't take anybody. The Germans have to come in here. We are living the territory and the Germans supposed to come here. You better run away from here. Run where? And I...to me I thought there's no help for nobody. Even I met already Russian partisans, already I thought they have certain salvation, there's no end, there's no help for nobody. You are alone. You you feel like you're in a cage and you're fighting to get out but all the doors are locked. But what they did, they gave me a horse, see, because this was deep in the woods. I didn't know if I'm in the moon or on earth. It was woods...dark around. They gave me a horse which they took from a peasant. You know partisans took whatever they needed and they said take this horse and run away from here because the Germans have to come here, the army, and your life isnot ___. I asked them what type of partisans are you, because there were two kinds of partisans. So they said we are the elite, the .

I got in on the horse and I let it...I knew how to ride horses before so L...the horse took me to the owner. It was a few, few...quite a few mile away in the woods...took me to the owner. The horse, you know...and I didn't know at that time that horses have a sense that they take you where you come from like like dogs. I went to the owner. It was a Ukrainian. He was very nice to be. He was happy he got the horse back. He gave me food and he said but don't stay here. Go further in the woods there and there. He said I heard that far away, you know, about ten, twenty miles, there's some Jews hiding. That's what he told me. I don't know where, but some Jews hiding in the woods. This I won't be alone. I went and I went in the daytime and I went through a village. See, from every few miles, five miles, ten...ten kilometers were villages cut out in the woods, what they have corn, land...they they're living...living three hundred, four hundred people, Ukrainians. I went in this village and I went into a house. I was hungry. I knocked on the door and I remember somebody said, in Polish, . Jew is here. That he was a policeman before the war and he was the only Polish family what lived in this village. He was scared to death to be there because they hated him, but it was...he didn't know yet where to go and what to do. He stayed there and he told me that I must be born under a lucky star that I came to him because if I would walk into any other house, I would be dead immediately.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: His name was Weinka (ph). So she said my son is a bad boy. Even they come in, if they see you here you wouldn't live two minutes, but she had a back door and the back door was leading to the out...outhouse. She says when they come in on the horses, you run out and when the come into the house, I give them drinks and you run away. I did. I did and I walked another two days and I came and I found Jewish, maybe twelve families living in the woods. It was already cold. It was snow over there _. They had built up from wood houses. They had a fire in in the back. There was no chimney and the fire was going out through the outside. You couldn't stand up because the smoke was killing you. You could only lay down and crawl, but it saved you. It it was made...built...they did it cru...you know, made out of...from the from the leaves. Everything was made out of leaves from the woods, and there were maybe five or six houses. And then I met a fellow which was a barber.</p><p>He...he was at my wedding in New York. I don't know where he is now. He was from Poland so he...the other people were from the small...from the other towns. They were...I was a...you know, Poland considered ___. _ He was with his wife and daughter and another girl and he said he would take me into his house. I should stay with him, because I was alone and I was from Poland, and he was actually the rich man because he had a profession and he went in to the...there was also a Polish village there from the people what Poland put in, there was a whole village. So he went in there and to cut their hair. He was a professional barber, and he had food he had brought in. But he had food for himself. We had to go at night or in daytime and to beg for food. My shoes were gone, so I had from wood made, you know, rags and that and around and we were every...once a week we were going to to the villages and to ask for food. The Polish village was too far and it was cold but the Ukrainian village was closer. One day I went into a village with another girl. The girl which was was theirs. She later died, and we knocked on the door and the la...my feet were already swollen because from the cold the shoes fell off. She took something rubbing it should go away. She gave me food and start knocking at the door. They knocked on the door, came in Ukrainian . You knew that the who come in, they'll see a Jewish fellow <span class="page-break" number="13"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 6 you see, I...so I start asking myself questions, how can luck bring you because he told me if we would catch you yesterday, we would have killed you because this just came out. So I went back and I stayed there in the woods, you know, but I was hungry. You had to go again to eat. What did we get? We get potatoes. Boiled potatoes without salt, the stomach can___ but that was the only thing what they gave us and some...we had places. One time I went into a Ukrainian house for begging. I didn't know where I'm going, and the man took...you know, for a fork what with they cut hay and he he throwed at me. I jumped out. I was young still and I jumped out. I was alert and it went through the wood. Otherwise it would went through me, and I run out because he didn't...he didn't like me, but somebody else, the same Ukra...the Ukrainians gave me food. They gave me a few potatoes and some told me come over 5 . This I remember because I I learned Ukrainian or <span class="page-break" number="14"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 7 children. If you kill them, I'll kill you. I [remember that the other Ukrainians, you know, they they got they got kind of shocked, you know. She was a good woman. She meant it just why should they kill us. And they said run. Run to the woods. We start running and every minute, even the the five hundred or thousand yards was like miles because I thought somebody from them would shot me, but she would have killed him probably. They would shot me in the back. We run in the woods and we were free already. We were saved. Again things like that doesn't happen, but it happened. But we realized...there were about five boys of us and my age...we realized that there's no life to go and beg and to to be killed, you know. Someday the luck will run out and the same time we we dropped the Polish, the the Ukrainian villages and went further to the Polish villages, but the Polish village, the Polish people...there were three hundred and eighty people there. They were very nice to us. They gave us food. They were working with the partisans and one day they were surrounded by Germans. The Germans sent in the army, the regular army and they took all the men and they shot them. Three hundred and eighty people they shot. The women, they shot and they killed them. They they poisoned. They didn't shot them but they gave them some some injection, something. Nobody, not one survived from that the whole village. That was a few villages, Polish villages, where they shot everybody. They did the same thing what they did, claiming that they are sympathetic to the to the partisan, to the Russian partisans. So we...the roads to beg or to eat were cut off, so we decided, five of us, that we are going to look for the partisans. We knew that the Russian partisans, there was a Russian partisan by the name of</p><p> . That's Colonel Niewiedow (ph). Niewiedow. They were the lead partisan</p><p> organization in the whole Ukraine which eighty percent were sent out from Moscow.</p><p>Normally there were two kind of partisans, the Russians. There were partisans they organized, natives, whoever wanted but the Ukrainians were against the Russians, so they didn't have much to organize. They had a very rough deal because they were against them, so they had to bring Russian people to fight the Germans, and those were the the true partisan uh to send out, you know, from . Later I found out seventy percent <span class="page-break" number="15"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 8 how to get to the partisans, cause we knew we can't survive. We didn't know when it's going to end and the woods was cold. It was forty below zero with no clothing, no food, no nothing. The older people stayed there. We're going to see how the the horses with the with the sleds, and we're going to follow and it happened that we saw a partisan with a sled and he happened to be Jewish. We went over to him. We told him who we are. He said I can't take you, but follow...don't say a word but follow my road and you'll get there. That's all he said.</p><p> He went away. We waited for an hour. It wasn't snowing, and we followed. We followed maybe five, six miles, and once we we were going, they came out and said hand, you know, raise your hands. And they took all five five of us separate places. How did you get here?</p><p>So I said we saw...we were looking for the partisans. We want to fight. We are against the Germans and we saw a road. We want to fight. Where are your guns? We don't have any guns. We're going to send you back and we made up, if they told us they send back, what we have to say. We have to say two things we agreed. We want to be killed by a Russian bullet, not by German. That was appeal (ph) to the Russians, and if they...if we'll see they don't want to take us, they should be aware that if the Germans catch us, we don't...we're not responsible what we're going to say. We had to use threat. To use threat to the Russians was pretty desperate, but we had no other way. They they took each one because they thought they didn't know.</p></p></dialogue>

They didn't know how we got there and they were...had to be careful too so they took each one separate and start asking questions, how we got to them, because if we can get to them, the Germans can get to them. You understand? So we didn't blame them. They heard one saying we want to...we want to fight.</p><p> We wanted this, and they decided to take us in because...decided not because we want to die for them but they were afraid that if the Germans catch us, they would...we will say...I mean they would say or something...they will they will force us, you know, to to say where they are. So the Germans were not close, but they were afraid to go in because they didn't know how strong the partisans are, and they also didn't know...you can't attack somebody in the woods because a division can't do...they didn't have that many divisions but they can't send in because they don't know where they're going to be hit. You can hide, you know, three people, ten people, a hundred can keep up a whole a whole brigade if you don't know where you're going to be hit. Soon as they took us in, they took all our clothes because we were in a horrible stage. They burned everything what we had. They gave us new clothing. It was like a paradise.

Once they did, it was a tumult and they start shooting. Partisans were hit. Partisans were killed, but we didn't have no mission to fight anybody, any Germans.

Why? Because I knew that they all enemies. They all Fascists, just like the Germans. The same Ukrainians what...you understand the , and the Bulbas, this what what they were killers are here in the army with me together, and I knew that I would be shot every minute in the back. Who will know? Who will care? One night I was on the front. For me it was one nightmare. On the front was already a different story. I was with a heavy machine gun and maybe sixty to a hundred feet...you know, the front is here and the Germans were on the other side, and I always kept two grenades with me in case the Germans catch me not to catch me alive. You know, it was a a fear which it was in me. Dead was not a ques...there was no fear. That itself was nothing because I went through so many times that it really became like a like a play...suffering. I was scared. So instead of the Germans should catch me, I better kill myself, so I kept two grenades in case of something happen, and one night I was standing with my machine gun in the front. On the other side were Germans, and five Ukrainian from my...I heard noise. Five Ukrainian tried to run over to the Germans. Four I wounded and one I killed, you know, because I thought the Germans are coming to me. They send out Russians in the morn...in the morning and they caught the four and they said they wanted to go to the Germans. They were not the only ones. The whole division would have gone over to the Germans, because their heart was not in Russia. Their heart was with Germans. I was ahero. Next day they took twenty thousand...the the the headquarters from the army made a big...see Russian like propaganda. In order to give heart to the army, they are experts in propaganda, and they had to...every day was hours of propaganda and hours of inter...you know, to fight was something because there was no other belief.

We are helping ourselves, making short and sweet. And there were tremendous...tremendous...you know, they they were happy with my speech, you know, and I and I talked to it what I meant with my heart because I knew that they are the only ones what they can kill the Germans.
