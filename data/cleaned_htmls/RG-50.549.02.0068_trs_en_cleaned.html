<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: March "93. And I just listened to it again. It was a remarkable experience as a</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> listener, to hear it. But I want to start, because this is a post-Holocaust interview, at the</p><p> end of that experience when you were by yourself in the forest. You'd been wandering</p><p> for a couple years, maybe?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: A couple -- three winters and two years.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- who found you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, yeah, they were pushing they -- at that time they were pushing the Germans</p><p> back and as it happened -- I don't know, it was I guess, an entire battalion, I'm not sure.</p><p> But Russian soldiers, Soviet Union soldiers were marching through the forest where I</p><p> was dying, actually. I -- usually when I was in the forest, I would dig a little grave and</p><p> cover it, camouflage it as much as I could and stay there as long as hunger and cold</p><p> would allow me to stay in one place. At that point I was very ill, I must have eaten</p><p> something that didn't agree with me. And I was in my own filth, surrounded by my own</p><p> filth, and I -- I think I was dying. I don't really recall one time, I think, that I wasn't</p><p> actually aware of it, and yet I must have been aware. When they literally stepped on me,</p><p> it was dark, at night and all of a sudden I felt -- I mean, in -- in the forest there are</p><p> always a lot of noises, so I didn't hear them coming. But all of a sudden I felt</p><p> something on my chest, and it was, I guess, one of the soldiers. And they realized it was</p><p> something alive. And to their credit and my luck, they did clean me up and put me ina</p><p> tent in a -- a military hospital and dragged me with them until we came to the city of</p><p> Luck, L-u-c-k, which is in the area where I come from. And there they found a -- a</p><p> regular hospital and they left me there. And apparently -- I never saw the note, but</p><p> apparently there was a note saying -- and I'm paraphrasing, but it was something like, The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In that time -- I -- it was in 1944, so how old was I? 19 -- I guess it was --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You were born in "29?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, December "29, and that was --</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- 14 -- 14 years old, or so, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. Do you remember them carry -- they must have carried you. Do you</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember them speaking with you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, all I remember is someone kept saying yebishka, yebishka and that means in</p><p> Russian, 1-little girl, little girl. But I did not speak. I don't remember speaking. I kept</p><p> throwing up, and I was very, very ill. And -- but I vaguely remember it. And then when</p><p> I did get into the hospital -- yeah, I don't think they carried me. I think they had like a --</p><p> horses with wagons. And I don't really know, maybe they did carry me, but they did</p><p> have that. And then they would have tents in forest -- The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Camps, yes, uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And they treated me very well. And later on, after the war we went to Russia</p><p> because I went back to my hometown, which is another story, which I'1l tell you about.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You told some of that in the first interview.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Did I?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: About going back, mm-hm, you did.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Where they tried to --</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, did I tell about that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, you did, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, anyway, but I tried to find out who were -- what kind of a te -- who were the --</p><p> the soldiers, especially the two soldiers who first found me, and were so -- gave me</p><p> back my life. And I couldn't get names or anything. I know one thing, that I still had a</p><p> gold coin, and I th -- the coins and all the jewelry that my mother sewed in, I don't</p><p> know if I told that in my first interview --</p></p></dialogue>

And so then I had like a rope, a -- a real</p><p> heavy rope that I wore on my neck. And that and my little penknife I had with me and</p><p> the gold -- gold coins and whatever else, and jewelry. And I still had one coin and I</p><p> gave it to them, to the two soldiers. I -- I do remember that, that was it. But other than</p><p> that, there was no real thank you or anything, for giving me back my life. But when I</p><p> ended up in the hospital at Luck, that's where they nursed me back to, I guess,</p><p> reasonable health. I did not speak for a long, long time, and I do remember that -- how I</p><p> regained my speech. I was on a ward. At that time, I mean, there were no private rooms,</p><p> or if there were I wasn't in one. And I was just in my cot, whatever, in clean sheets, it</p><p> was wonderful. And -- but I did not speak. And then all of a sudden there was an</p><p> attendant. It was not a doctor and it was not a nurse, but a young woman. And she was</p><p> sort of humming while she was doing things and all of a sudden she started singing a</p><p> song that my mother used to sing to me. And, I mean it just gave me chills and I started</p><p> talking. That, you know, brought back my speech. And it was a very, you know,</p><p> emotional day at that time. But when I was nursed back to health, I found there was one</p><p> other survivor from my hometown. And it seemed that most of the survivors -- the war</p><p> was not over yet in 1944, but for us, for all intents and purposes, the war was over. And</p><p> so everybody who survived tried to gather in a larger town. And Luck, or Lvov, which The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

And</p><p> Horochow, my town, was also in between. So a lot of people gathered in Luck, and</p><p> that's where I was, in that hospital. And I came out of the hospital, I found a lot of --</p><p> not a lot, but survivors. And I did meet the other survivor from my hometown. They say</p><p> that there are more people who survived, but these were people who my father and</p><p> other people in Horochow helped escape before the war started and who eventually</p><p> ended up in what was then Palestine.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And as a matter of fact, when we went, my husband and I went to Israel a number of</p><p> years ago, I can't remember when, the st -- these were old students of my father's and</p><p> they gathered together and they had an evening dedicated to the memory of my father.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Wow.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But coming back to Luck.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Before we go, can you put this on the table, cause I can hear it pretty si -- loudly.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's okay. So you -- you went to this meeting, people were gathering, survivors</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> were gathering and you met this one survivor who was from your town, somebody that</p><p> you knew before?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, she was -- she used to be a st -- a part time student of my father's.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And -- because my father taught at the university in Lvov, but he also taught in</p><p> Horochow. There were several different schools there and there was a gymnasium. A</p><p> gymnasium is a -- not a gymnasium here, like here, but it is the next step after high</p><p> school. Sort of an in-between school. But anyway, I did know her family. She was</p><p> actually married before the war and had a baby, but she lost her entire family, and she</p><p> survived by herself. And the two of us decided to go back to my hometown, and -- to</p><p> our hometown and to find out maybe some other people or our loved ones survived.</p><p> And so we set out. Transportation was very difficult in those days.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How far was it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, it wa -- by car now, it would be an hour and a half, that's all. And at that time</p><p> there was no car -- there were no cars available. Trains were going maybe once a week</p><p> or so, so you had to hitchhike, and -- with the soldiers, with the military or with farmers</p><p> in trucks, or just wagons with horses. It took us two days to get back to our -- our The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

And there we were not greeted very warmly. The people in our hometown -</p><p> - and this was going on all over eastern Poland, I don't know about other countries, but</p><p> in eastern Po -- what used to be eastern Poland, the populace was very greedy and they</p><p> did get everything. All our possessions, all our material possessions ended up in their</p><p> hands because when we were ordered to go into the ghetto, we could only take with us</p><p> what we could carry, nothing else. And so everything else went to the neighbors and</p><p> whoever got ahold of it, or -- I don't know how the Germans and the Ukrainians at that</p><p> time directed and disposed of all the material goods. And then there were homes,</p><p> houses. And they felt, I'm sure, the local populace, that whoever survived</p><p> [indecipherable] will come and say now, I want my house back, I want my -- all my</p><p> furniture back. I want my linens, my silver, my -- all sorts of stuff. And that probably --</p><p> and besides, there was still, and still is, there's great anti-Semitism in that area. And</p><p> they resented our surviving and that made us feel very, very hurt. And it seemed at that</p><p> point that there was a movement that -- you know how rumors start and all, and there</p><p> was a movement in our -- our -- our direction for everyone to gather in Germany. Why</p><p> in Germany?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p> you remember any specific encounters with people in your hometown when you went</p><p> back that first time?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And did you go to your house?</p></p></dialogue>

If</p><p> only we knew what was happening, what was going on, we would have helped. Well,</p><p> how could they not have known? And I mean they were right there, we were</p><p> surrounded by our neighbors before we went into the ghetto and I-I mean especially in</p><p> the very beginning, the Germans when they first came in, they had lists with names</p><p> whom to take. And when my father was -- when they came after my father and that was</p><p> right in the very beginning after they burned the synagogues and all that, and my father</p><p> tried to escape through the back door, there were two Ukrainians right there, who we</p><p> knew, and they wouldn't let him -- they wouldn't even let him say goodbye to us. So</p><p> they knew. But that was their response; if only we knew, we would have helped. And</p><p> that's -- that -- that -- I heard that all over in my neighborhood.

And -- but the thing was that he didn't want to</p><p> put any more money into the house, and he left two rooms or so unfinished, and they</p><p> were still unfinished at the end of war, or when we came, you know, to -- to see. My</p><p> friend, the other survivor, lived actually on the outskirts of Horochow, and it was a little</p><p> village, almost like a suburb and the name of it was Skamelka. And she went back</p><p> there, and she didn't find anyone very receptive, very happy about her survival. She</p><p> was actually hidden by a farmer throughout the entire war. So she had one friend. What</p><p> is so very puzzling to me -- it's not puzzling, it's just very disappointing to this day.</p><p> I've gotten rid of the hate and the anger because it was destroying me personally, but I</p><p> feel a great disappointment by the fact or from the fact that our neighbors and our town,</p><p> where we co-existed in a very nice way, my father and mother and other Jewish leaders</p><p> were working hand in hand with the Gentile population for the good of the entire</p><p> community. And I'm not just saying that, but it's such a puzzlement to me that friends</p><p> and neighbors who lived in -- in harmony, all of a sudden, overnight could turn into</p><p> enemies, and not one of them helped.

Why? Why such hate? I-I -- I cannot</p><p> understand it. And I don't know -- now I was thinking maybe it's envy. It was envy</p><p> because they worked hard, most of them were poor peasants, you know, and they never</p><p> accomplished anything in their lives.

But when my efforts to join my</p><p> family in -- in the United States were coming to nothing, I decided that perhaps -- I only</p><p> had a third grade education -- I decided maybe I could go to school and emigrate on a</p><p> student visa. And at that time I felt that -- I don't know why, but there was a DP camp</p><p> by the name Benzheim and that was between Darmstadt and Frankfurt, and very close</p><p> to Heidelberg. And I'm not sure, but I think my father had a lot of, you know,</p><p> doctorates, and one of them, I think, was from Heidelberg. And I went to Heidelberg</p><p> and I spoke German at that -- you know, so I asked them if they would take me on as a</p><p> student. And they sort of looked me up and down, and where are your papers, you</p><p> know, from school? And I said I have none. And they were very helpful. They gave me</p><p> a tutor and they took all sorts of crazy tests. And because, I guess, I was a Jewish</p><p> survivor, they accepted me. I stayed there for over a year, and thought that I would go --</p><p> emigrate on a student visa. But by that time my papers started taking on importance and</p><p> I eventually ended up going on the papers that my family provided for me. But it took</p><p> three years after the war before I ended up in the United States. There's one other thing</p><p> that I would like to mention, and I do mention it all, you know, when I speak to schools, The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

I -- it was very</p><p> difficult for me to comprehend and to understand that even after the war, there were</p><p> pogroms in Poland. Not just eastern Poland, but all over Poland. Now, the eastern part</p><p> of Poland, after the war ended, became the property of the Soviet Union. So Poland was</p><p> actually divided. And the Poland that I knew from before the war was no more. It was --</p><p> a third of it was chunked off to the Soviet regime. And what was going on all over</p><p> Poland were pogroms, after the war. And the local populace was so resentful of our</p><p> surviving that to them the only solution of getting rid of us is to kill us. And I don't</p><p> know if you've ever heard of Kielce. Kielce is someplace -- my geography is not that</p><p> good, but I think it's in central Poland. And Kielce was a big town, a big city and had a</p><p> lot of Jews before the war. On the fourth of July, 1946, the local populace got together</p><p> and murdered 42 Jewish survivors. And that was one of the most infamous pogroms. I</p><p> think they mention it on the second floor in the museum, when they talk about DP</p><p> camps and all. Kielce, one of the most infamous pogroms. And that was devastating to</p><p> hear when we were in the DP camps, about these happenings. And this was going on all</p><p> over the place in Poland. So when anybody says that now there are no Jews in Poland,</p><p> and consequently there can't be any anti-Semitism, it ain't so. It's not so, and I would</p><p> like to -- I wanted to make that point.</p><p>The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, it was like I was coming from Mars. And part of it was my fault. But I had so</p><p> much pain and so much hurt.

And she was sort of lost, too.</p><p> She needed comforting. And my poor aunt was torn. And it was very, very difficult. But</p><p> to answer your question about the family, as it happened, the four other sisters of my</p><p> father all lived in New York. And all of -- all the f -- the four sisters were married and</p><p> each one had children. I became closest with Aunt Belka's daughter, she had only one</p><p> daughter, Rosalie also -- popular name in my family -- and her fiance, Stanley. And</p><p> they -- eventually they -- they did marry, I think the same year. I became close with</p><p> them because they were the ones who first greeted me when I first came here.

Aunt Sarah was the oldest of my father's</p><p> sisters and she had two children, Joe and Millie. Millie is still alive. Millie must be now</p><p> about 80 years old or so. She is the daughter of the oldest aunt. But I was not very close</p><p> with them because they were all in New York and they did not exchange frequent visits</p><p> to Columbus. So basically the family would get together for different occasions like</p><p> weddings, or Bar and Bat Mitzvahs, which I never knew about because this was a new</p><p> happening for me, a new experience in the United States. But I was closest with my</p><p> Aunt Bertha with whom I lived, who opened her home and heart to me and gave me</p><p> unconditional love. Unconditional love. And her children, she had three children. She</p><p> had two sons, Marty, the oldest and Bobby. Bobby is now in L.A..

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- in the beginning I had no social life.

There was a basement in the</p><p> apartment. It was difficult. It was very difficult. My studies were progressing, I did</p><p> quite well. I wanted so badly to become Americanized. And I was attending school and</p><p> I did very well there, and I was still, you know, working at the store part-time. And my</p><p> aunt tried her best to be my friend and to be my -- my healer, in a way. But it was</p><p> difficult.

He was from New York and he came from a family, very</p><p> nice family, he has one sister, and he had parents, obviously. He was in the military, he</p><p> enlisted in the military when second World War started. And when the war ended, he</p><p> got out. And he was sort of at loose ends, he didn't know what to do with himself. He</p><p> didn't have a college education, so he started going to school and trying to see what he</p><p> can do with himself. He had some kind of a job at that time in New York, but I don't</p><p> know why, but he came to visit, and look around, maybe he was going to go to Ohio</p><p> State or whatever. And he came to visit his cousins and it was, as they say in French</p><p> [indecipherable], I guess.

His -- his mother was German, she came from Germany. And her parents are</p><p> his -- my husband's grandfather, Grandpa Harkavy was a cigar manufacturer for the</p><p> Kaiser in Germany. And they both, Baubi and Zedi Harkavy they come from the</p><p> famous Harkavys who -- some of these relatives were writing -- have written a prayer</p><p> book, you know, for -- you know, for services and all.

Why? Because all of a sudden I was part of a group. I finally belonged. I</p><p> was a wife of a military person. And the military wives and all, accept you</p><p> unconditionally, without reservations, without questions, you are one of them, and they</p><p> take care of you. And I did not experience anything like this until I married my</p><p> husband, and until -- I mean, he wi -- became part of the military. And of course at that</p><p> time it was also, ah, a nice Jewish guy, what is he doing in the military, you know?

And the military isn't stupid. They said, well, if you --</p><p> if you want to bring your wife over, you have to sign up for three more years. Yeah. Or</p><p> something like that, I mean I'm -- I'm not quite sure. But anyway, so my husband had</p><p> to sign up for another three years to serve in order to bring me to Germany.

And, you know, by the time she'd look around she'd have 25 people for</p><p> dinner. And she would just do it as, you know, talking to you or me. And I couldn't do</p><p> anything like that. But anyway, she gave me this book and I was offended, but I really</p><p> needed it because I didn't know how to cook and how to entertain.

And even</p><p> though I hated being in Germany, and I mean, there were many instances where I never</p><p> let on that I spoke German. And so many -- once my husband's sister came to visit and</p><p> we went in, she wanted to buy some gifts. And there's this fashionable -- they still wear</p><p> them, they call them lederhosen, you know, the short -- she wanted to buy some. We</p><p> went into a shop and this salesgirl, you know, was yelling back, and she says, these are</p><p> Ammies, you know, Americans. How much do I -- you know, what kind of price do I</p><p> quote them? And they yelled back, telling them, you know, how much to ask, cause</p><p> things were not marked.

A nurse. But --</p><p> because it takes a special person to understand a doctor, you know. But anyway, she --</p><p> when she sometimes hears about -- listens to our conversations now she says, I could</p><p> never be a military wife. And I can see that, you know, but for me, again, I think I said</p><p> it before, it was the best thing that ever happened to me. But I had to learn -- well, I</p><p> didn't have to, because I was used to it, but you have to take the bitter with the sweet.</p><p> Going to Japan was an -- an occasion for us very exciting, but the whole, the entire</p><p> family, mine and my husband's was very much against it.

We had to go to the state of Washington, I don't</p><p> know where we left from, someplace there. It was a military place and that's where we</p><p> went. And what happens usually w -- in the military, and especially when you have a</p><p> child, when you go overseas -- at that time we didn't have much in -- as far as furniture</p><p> and all, but we had a little bit of stuff. And so when the packers came to pack us -- they</p><p> call it hold luggage, hold baggage and regular baggage. The hold baggage is supposed</p><p> to come right after you arrive in the new country, cause that's the stuff that you cannot</p><p> do without. So what could I not do without? I needed a crib, I needed diapers, and in</p><p> those days you had diaper that you had to wash, and all the things that I needed for my</p><p> son, right, and a few things for us. And -- and that's the way it -- so that was our hold</p><p> luggage and the rest was going to come later. When we -- well, first of all, we boarded -</p><p> - is that what you call it, boarded a-a -- the ship, and right away the military has their</p><p> own way.

And me, I</p><p> got sick, you know, again. And my s -- my husband was down with the troops, so we</p><p> had no care except for the people who, you know, care for you, th-the waiters or</p><p> whatever you call them. And this was a military ship, so we had some nurses and all.</p><p> By the time we got to Japan, I mean, I couldn't wait to see the ground, to feel the</p><p> ground, you know, under my feet.

So for the first year I hardly saw him. And the thing that really scared me, I mean</p><p> you learn and you do, you know, what you have to do, and the baby was being cleaned</p><p> and all with water that we had to boil and we had to put Clorox in. And my little helper</p><p> would come every day and we sort of, you know, communicated. And she had to go</p><p> and buy me diapers in a Japanese place, and we had to get a crib from somewhere.

She -- by that time she learned English a little bit, and she wanted</p><p> to go to America badly, but she, being the eldest in the family, sh -- it was her</p><p> assignment, her task to take care of her parents. So she couldn't -- unless we would take</p><p> her parents, and of course we couldn't do that. Now, coming back to Japan. For the first</p><p> year, was very difficult, but our son thrived and he gained weight, and it -- you know,</p><p> for me it was a full time -- full time and a half of -- of, you know, taking care of him,</p><p> and without my husband's help and in a strange country without knowing the language</p><p> and the customs. There was one thing that occurred at that time that is -- I think I should</p><p> mention. I was introduced to something called typhoon. They have typhoons and this is</p><p> like a hurricane, I-I think on a grander scale, cause you know, Japan is like an island.</p><p> And anyway, we had this typhoon and I mean, you have to prepare yourself and all --</p><p> everything was closed and all. And I was still in that one house on the depot, there were</p><p> no other houses. But the military, they would call me, and some of the wives would</p><p> come, you know, and lend a helping hand.

And the house</p><p> was a not a very, I guess, sturdy house. But we lived through it, was about three or four</p><p> days, but in the middle of the typhoon, I did get a -- I had a telephone. I did get a</p><p> telephone call from one of my compatriots who lived already in the American section,</p><p> which we later did get housing and we joined. And she called me to let me know that</p><p> my husband was killed in the typhoon. He was on a boat because his lab was on a little</p><p> island off Yakoska. Yakoska is a port, and we always used to make fun that everything</p><p> was classified, but you go to Yakoska because you know, it is a -- a -- what do you call</p><p> it, port city, and on all the bars and all it says, welcome the Enterprise. In other words,</p><p> Enterprise the ship is arriving. It was supposed to be classified, but they na -- knew it</p><p> all. Well anyway, this friend called me to say that my husband was killed. He drown --</p><p> his little boat that he was going from the lab, he was trying to come back home, and</p><p> then the boat capsized and he drowned.

But of course there was</p><p> always the worry about your husband, you know, and I mean he had to fly out to</p><p> different countries and all and I -- and that's the army, the military life is that there are</p><p> many separations.

And I said, I'm an American and in our society, the man come</p><p> with their spouses. And they allowed me to do that. And I -- I -- I would say that I</p><p> probably established the first of -- I guess, way of including the wives. Because when</p><p> we went to the Japanese affairs, there were never any wives. There were Geisha girls,</p><p> who were assigned to entertain the men and the women, because we were invited. And I</p><p> mean, we would have a Geisha, and I mean she would -- I mean, it was clean fun, but</p><p> very sexist. I mean, in the sense that the wife is subservient and the Geisha is supposed</p><p> to amuse me, you know, with some stupid things. It was very -- I'm sorry.

And they were sort</p><p> of tolerated. That's the way I felt with the Japanese. But when I invited the wives, the</p><p> spouses of these business people, I'1l tell you, every one of them came. They were</p><p> dressed in their most beautiful kimonos, th-their outfits, their national, you know,</p><p> outfits are magnificent. Each one brought an exquisite gift.

And other women took the lead from my lead, and they started doing the same thing.</p><p> And I felt very empowered, very good about what I accomplished there.

And Stephen said that he and I got along and he accepted me the way I</p><p> was because I am his mother. But he didn't blame the Holocaust for my what do you</p><p> call it? Peculiarities or for my idiosyncrasies. I was his mother, and as his mother he</p><p> loved me the way I am. And that was his main argument, that it didn't have anything to</p><p> do with being a survivor. He accepted me the way I was. He didn't blame it on the</p><p> Holocaust or on my being a survivor, why I had temper tantrums, why I yelled at him,</p><p> why I wanted him to be better than perfect.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Why don't you tell me about that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, yeah it was -- I think it was in 1983, and at that time my husband was out of</p><p> the military, he had a new career, our son was in school, and -- already in college, I</p><p> guess.

She did get married, like you were mentioning, in -- at the DP</p><p> camp, in Benzheim. She married a -- a middle -- an older -- mostly it used to be, you</p><p> know, older men. She married a very nice, very fine fellow, and he had a brother, and af</p><p> -- the brother had also a family and they all -- they all emigrated to America together.</p><p> And my friend's -- Rya is her name -- Rya's mother was still alive. And all of them</p><p> ended up in the United States, I think about a year before I did. How they were able to</p><p> do that, I don't know, but sh-she was the only one I kept in touch with. And at that time</p><p> it wasn't that I felt the need for it, I just felt it was time to get in touch in with other</p><p> survivors. Maybe it was a need, I don't know, but I felt it was time because I was in one</p><p> place and I wasn't going to go overseas again. And so when the time came, as it was,</p><p> there was going to be, I think the first gathering of survivors in Washington, D.C., and I</p><p> think it was 1983, and I attended it. It was not quite a week, but it was more than one</p><p> day, I don't recall exactly. And there I met many new people, and some whom I have</p><p> known from the DP camps, and it was nice to be together. It was a rather emotional and</p><p> solemn gathering. And most of the people that I knew have settled and have also started</p><p> their own lives and were successful in becoming Americanized.

And he made a very emotional and very</p><p> memorable speech at that meeting, and he was telling us -- he was -- he was born in</p><p> Bergen-Belsen, where his parents ended up at the end of the war. And when they said, I</p><p> was born in Bergen-Belsen, people said, oh in a deep -- in a concentration camp? No, at</p><p> that time it was a DP camp. But he was born in that camp, and he became very active</p><p> and he still is. I forgot his first name, but you know, that I remember from that meeting.</p><p> And after that meeting, things were quiet, but it's sort of like -- it gave me a little seed</p><p> in my mind. I knew I had to do something, I didn't know what, and I didn't know what</p><p> I was ready to do. At that point we did belong to Agudas Achim and our friend Shelly</p><p> Elster the rabbi, was still with us. And I went to him and I said, I want to do something</p><p> to honor the memory of all the ones, the millions who perished in the Holocaust.

And they started observing -- at that time they did already observe it</p><p> at the rotunda, you know, in the Capitol. But our synagogue usually had sort of a</p><p> religious school, you know, commemoration or something, not as elaborate and all, but</p><p> just to commemorate. And I said well, I don't know, but if I -- I don't think I could</p><p> learn by April, you know, all the chanting and all the Haftorah and everything. Cause I</p><p> didn't know any of the blessings in Hebrew, nothing. Didn't even know how to read.</p><p> And he says, I'll teach you, and he proceeded to teach me. And by April, to make it -- it</p><p> was very difficult and it took an awful lot of time, and my husband said he could recite</p><p> some of the prayers in his sleep because he heard me repeating them so many times.</p><p> And came f -- when -- when April came, I don't remember what day, I think it was also</p><p> the 25" or something, 21% or 25", I was ready for my -- for becoming a Bat Mitzvah.</p><p> And I learned all the chanting and all this in the three months. And that was very -- a</p><p> very nice accomplishment. I invited the entire congregation and actually some of my</p><p> relatives from Columbus, Ohio and New York, and some of them came. And they said</p><p> later, they said, yeah we came because we felt sorry for you and we didn't want you to</p><p> fall on your face without family around. Well, I didn't fall on my face.

And after that we did attend synagogue pretty regularly, maybe</p><p> not every Saturday or -- but around that time when I was preparing for my Bat Mitzvah,</p><p> I did. I wrote a poem for that occasion and I made -- and my remarks were centered</p><p> around the theme that this is Yom HaShoah and I'd like -- this is my way of honoring</p><p> all the millions who perished during the Holocaust. And it was -- I felt very good about</p><p> it. Well, at this time my wonderful rabbi was preparing kids for their confirmation class</p><p> -- mean for their graduation, they have Hebrew school and then, you know, religious</p><p> school and then the people -- the students who want to go on after their bat mit -- Bar</p><p> and Bat Mitzvah when -- they call them to confirmation class. And he says, you must</p><p> go and speak to my kids in confirmation class. And I looked at him, I said, Shelly, I</p><p> cannot do that. I -- my English isn't good. I -- 1 -- I don't have my story, you know, in --</p><p> in my head. He says, I don't care. And that was a Sunday morning when he has a class.</p><p> He dragged me in and he says, I'll give you questions and you answer. And that was my</p><p> first presentation, against my will. I was petrified, and I mean, I -- I was not a public</p><p> speaker, not that I am now, but I -- I -- it was very difficult and it was really, I mean, he</p><p> pushed me and I was angry with him that he did. But it was a wonderful beginning. Not</p><p> a wonderful, but a beginning of something that I realized I had to do.

And then when</p><p> they finished listening to the description and going through the rooms, they -- each one</p><p> would receive a tile, and they had to register their impressions with painting a</p><p> statement. And -- you know, they gave them paint and -- and the tiles. And this one</p><p> time there were two kids in that group, from two different classes, but the same school.</p><p> And of course they always had chaperones, and this father, this one man, came over to</p><p> me. I happened tha -- usually he -- when they had these presentations of Daniel's story,</p><p> they tried to get a survivor to finish off.

Well, it was my turn, because I participated in it, to speak that</p><p> day and I got up, wherever it was, and there were all these kids, you know, sitting and</p><p> listening to my story.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because every day when I tell my story, I remember -- and now it's getting hazy, but</p><p> I remember new details, and it's as if reliving everything that happened all over again.</p><p> It's not a catharsis, no way. Many times I -- I -- | went with David Klevin the other day</p><p> to a school and I -- usually they allot me -- allow me to speak an hour, maybe two at the</p><p> most. And there, I think I was there 9:15, didn't get out until one o'clock, because the</p><p> kids had so many questions and they had the time from other subjects, they allowed</p><p> them to stay, you know, and que -- question me. And when I got home, you know what</p><p> I did? Went to bed. I was emotionally drained and that happens a lot. So it is not a</p><p> catharsis, but it feels that -- it feels that I have to do it.

It was just like everyone else felt, you know, in their hearts. That's the</p><p> way the weather was reflecting it. And our son came down to be with us and to witness</p><p> it, too. And then I said, well gosh, I mean, the museum is here, let me see what I can do</p><p> there. I don't think it was right when they opened, but a little later. And then came --</p><p> John Minnick joined, and he is the director of the Speakers" Bureau. And I filled out</p><p> some papers, and somebody said well, why don't you go and become a -- work in the</p><p> archives or start translating, you know, that's a very interesting thing, you know, I</p><p> could translate in several languages. And then, I don't know if I'm proficient any more,</p><p> but at that time I thought, well, I'd rather be with people. I want to do something where</p><p> I'm not going to be by myself.

I mean, I started out, and I'm not a speaker, but I feel</p><p> now that I -- I write out my remarks, mostly, because of being so sick when -- early on</p><p> in my life. Sometimes I start speaking and I'm at a loss for a word. I cannot remember</p><p> it. But when I have it written out, I'm much more comfortable. And I have several -- I</p><p> have about -- every time I change a little bit and I have about 20 different formats. One</p><p> is 20 pages, one is 40 pages, you know, things like that.

Some of these people</p><p> have selfish motives. They don't want to be remind -- reminded of their experiences,</p><p> and they don't want to have anything to do with it. I remember one meeting we</p><p> attended -- every year we have international meetings, that people from all over Israel</p><p> and from Europe come to these meetings. And every month we have our own meetings.</p><p> Once we had an international meeting, and I met two brothers from Connecticut, two</p><p> brothers who survived the Holocaust. One brother talks about it all the time -- not all</p><p> the time, but I mean, he is facing reality and his past. The other guy is -- he -- it's the</p><p> first time he introduced him cause that was the first time he ever came to a meeting, that</p><p> was an international meeting. And he has never spoken about his experiences. He's</p><p> married to an American woman who doesn't know his past. I mean, I don't see how</p><p> you can live with a person and not tell her your story. But anyway, he doesn't want to</p><p> face it. You know, he doesn't want to go through again what he what -- what he lived</p><p> through once. So, I don't know, I don't know how to explain it.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, it's not just the lo -- it's -- it-it's a -- we have, I think, about 30 or 45 different</p><p> groups in the United States, in England, in -- all over the place. And it's stupid, then no</p><p> -- again I'm using the word I shouldn't, but it is, in a way childish to refer to ourselves,</p><p> child survivor -- survivors. Most of the people who survived were children. Very few</p><p> adults did survive. But now none of us is a child, but we still refer to ourselves as child</p><p> survivors. The difference in these groups -- I don't know if you're familiar with Nessie</p><p> Godin in th-the museum? Who doesn't know Nessie? Her group -- I say her, she is the</p><p> co-chairman of the group, is survivors and friends. Their policy was from the beginning</p><p> to open their -- I mean, they accept anyone who is interested in the cause of the</p><p> Holocaust, or in -- in the theme, Holocaust, is welcome. Our group, to this day, is -- I</p><p> would call it almost like a hypochondriac cause, or case. They feel, most of them do,</p><p> God forbid anybody should join who is not a Holocaust survivor.

Is he a survivor? No. Out you go. They wouldn't allow him to</p><p> stay, so I got up and I was going to go. And I mean, eventually, after some debate and</p><p> all, they magnanimously allowed my husband to come to the meetings. Now, this</p><p> situation has sort of evolved. Now spouses, if they are not survivors, are allowed to</p><p> come. But it's sort of a real closed group. They don't want to have any kind of</p><p> relationship with anybody else.

It's just that life has dealt me a very difficult hand, and I learned how to cope</p><p> with it, and how to deal with it, partly because of my wonderful help from my husband</p><p> and my son.

But the reason I brought up September 11", September</p><p> 11" is unique in my mind for one reason only. It was the first time that here in America</p><p> we were touched on our soil.

It seems that</p><p> until September 11", all the other horrible, horrible situations in Rwanda, where the The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

The general who was in charge of the Rwanda, you know, contingent, and he</p><p> was promised by the United Nations to get all the help he needed, and when he got to</p><p> Rwanda, all he saw is death and destruction and massacre and not any help from the</p><p> United Nations. And consequently he resigned his post and became a drunk for awhile.</p><p> I mean, now he wrote a book and he speaks about this situation. That churns within me</p><p> and it makes me sick, physically ill. All this, Bosnia and all that. But to the American</p><p> psyche, I think one of the most important thing, do anything, but don't come to my</p><p> beloved America, to my soil, on my soil. Don't do anything on my soil. And sin the --</p><p> since the Civil War and all, all the wars were fought outside of the United States. And</p><p> September 11", sadly, touched us right here. And that's why it's so important to the</p><p> Americans. That's the way I figure. I also have seen something here that I was missing</p><p> all these years. We went to Israel, can't remember when, in the 80's, and the first thing</p><p> that struck me was the fantastic pride and patriotism that the people have. Maybe</p><p> they're not as observant, you know, religiously, but when they wore that uni -- wore th-</p><p> the uniform of the military, they did it with pride, wearing it and holding their heads up</p><p> high. Here in America, when there is a war, God forbid, the military is regarded as one</p><p> of us. When there is no war, the military are second rate citizens.

Since September 11", you</p><p> see stickers, I'm proud to be an American. You see the flag on cars and I think it did</p><p> awake our patriotism and our pride in being an American. And it didn't do that when</p><p> Chechnya started, when Bosnia started, when Uganda started, when -- when all these</p><p> other terrible, you know, wars started su -- on a different soil, not on American soil.</p><p> And this is why I think it's different. I might be -- I'm probably very wrong, but this is</p><p> my explanation. And that's why, until now, am -- most places, I always when I start my</p><p> remarks, since September 11", I start with the horrible tragedy of September 11", and I</p><p> compare it. And I -- I do say it has no comparison to the Holocaust, but it is also driven</p><p> by evil, by -- by people who hate, blind hate, and by people who have no regards for</p><p> human life. And this is one thing that we must fight for. And I -- I have my four evil</p><p> eyes, and I say even now, 55 years after the Holocaust, we must all fight the four evil</p><p> eyes. The evil of indifference, the evil of injustice, the evil of intolerance and the evil of</p><p> ignorance, four eyes. And the kids always write it down.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was very, very emotional. The reason it was emotional, first of all, we've made</p><p> friends while here, with -- usually we try to find out who is here from Israel, and we</p><p> became very good friends with the military attaches and the ambassadors and all, and</p><p> they would stay here three years and then go back to Israel.

Can't remember the years, it's terrible.</p><p> But anyway, when we were visiting Israel, we got in touch with the Granats and we had</p><p> a wonderful time visiting them. And then I did get in touch with some people with</p><p> whom I was -- I wasn't in the same DP camp, but they were in a neighboring, there</p><p> were so many of them. And there was one guy there who was my father's student. And</p><p> he ended up he didn't make it to Palestine, he ended up being caught and he ended up in</p><p> the Polish army when the war started, and so he had a story of his own. But when he</p><p> came out after the war, he s -- found out that I was alive and he came to say hello. And</p><p> through me he met this other girl, who was in a different DP camp and they fell in love</p><p> and they got married. So we visited with them.</p></p></dialogue>

You do feel hope for humankind.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well I -- yes, I do, I still do, in spite of it all, because if I didn't, I couldn't go -- I</p><p> never speak to the school kids, especially school kids, and adults too, without injecting</p><p> some hope in my remarks. I know nobody can live without hope. You might as well</p><p> give up. And I know in my -- in -- in my darkest hours, no matter how I came to</p><p> achieve it, if I tried, you know, to -- to just talk myself into it, but I always felt that I</p><p> must have hope, and I have hope now. And I think, I mean, it's no comparison, but</p><p> when my husband got so ill, I prayed to God and at that time I said, God, I -- I don't</p><p> care what you do, please give me hope that he's going to go on and he's going to live.</p><p>The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

There was a Catholic priest -- they</p><p> have a priest and a rabbi and all at the Walter Reed Hospital, and this priest just start --</p><p> just happened to pass when I was sitting there, and I mean, I wasn't crying, but I was</p><p> sitting in the corner waiting for some results. And I was -- I looked very sad, and I think</p><p> I was waiting for our son to come and I -- he says -- what -- what's bothering you, my</p><p> child? And I told him. And he says, Pll pray for him he'll be all right. Yeah. And that</p><p> Christmas we went over and we gave him a nice donation. He was there for -- he's gone</p><p> now, he's gone someplace else. But a Catholic priest, you know, had so much</p><p> compassion. That gives me hope, because there is something good in every human</p><p> being. And I also have another philosophy. You know how women get together and</p><p> they start gossiping and all, and I don't like to gossip. But I always say, if you don't</p><p> have anything nice to say, don't say anything. Say only when you have something nice</p><p> to say, otherwise don't. And if you feel, you know, anger and all, try to concentrate and</p><p> try to find something nice about that person. And sometimes it's very difficult to do</p><p> that, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. I should go over that and refresh some of what I said and some what I didn't</p><p> say.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But she -- she was -- and she wasn't the only one. It seems that most of the</p><p> nourishment -- nourish -- nurturing befell to the women, because most of the men were</p><p> gone right away. And this was his -- Hitler's plan, you know, take away the leaders and</p><p> everything will fall apart. And that's what happened. But the women came through</p><p> gloriously. And I know my mother kept spinning tales that -- I mean, now they are</p><p> laughable I am sure, but everything that she -- that came out of her lips always ended</p><p> with hope. When they took my father away, both of us cried, my sister and I. And she</p><p> gathered us -- she -- she hugged us, she didn't say anything. And later she was making</p><p> plans, what kind of a party we'll have when Papa would come home. And, I mean, she</p><p> always invited people, even in the ghetto, when she saw a little urchin, a little boy, or -- The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

And she was a genius at making soup, and she'd add more water and</p><p> whatever, I don't know, but everything she made, because we were hungry too, tasted</p><p> so good. And it was always shared with so much good feelings. It wasn't just oh gosh,</p><p> we don't have anything for tomorrow, you know, but well, we'll have something</p><p> tomorrow too. Enjoy it, and eat, you know. And it -- it was -- she gave us so much --</p><p> she gave me so much strength. And I wish I could be one-tenth of the person that she</p><p> was. And sh-she was strong, and she was very wise, and she wasn't the only one. They</p><p> -- she and a group of women organized a school for a -- for the kids who didn't work,</p><p> too young to work. And there again, we could have lied about our age had we known</p><p> ahead of time, but we didn't. But this too was such a wonderful gesture, to -- to be with</p><p> the kids. And -- and they were tired and beat, you know, from the work that they did all</p><p> day, and yet they would come with smiles on their faces and sing happy songs for us,</p><p> just to keep us occupied and to give us something to do. Yes, my mother was a very</p><p> special woman, but she wasn't the only one. I think ordinary people -- and my mother</p><p> was not ordinary, she was extraordinary, but I think even ordinary people were made</p><p> extraordinary by their circumstances in the ghetto. And I mean, what befell us, you</p><p> know, when the Germans came in, that people who were ordinary became heroes. And The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

That's another thing that I, nowadays feel very strongly</p><p> about it, and I keep learning much more, is the fact that there was so much resistance,</p><p> and there was so much -- there were uprisings, you know, all over the place. Sobibor,</p><p> Auschwitz, and of course, Warsaw. But I was reading someplace just recently that there</p><p> was resistance in 105 different ghettos. And I think probably it will come up that it -- it</p><p> was more than 105 ghettos. Cause my mother's school, that's resistance. The -- our kids</p><p> getting together, about 20 of us, building a tunnel. Tunnel, it wasn't really a tunnel, but</p><p> it was a tunnel. That's resistance. And these kind of forms of resistance took place</p><p> almost in every little ghetto. And that is something that when we consider that there</p><p> was practically no help from the outside, and even in -- in the Warsaw ghetto, how</p><p> difficult it was to obtain weapons, and you know, how very -- even for money -- I</p><p> mean, people would, on the outside, would promise you weapons, and then you would</p><p> come and you'd find empty shells or you know, corroded things that didn't work. And</p><p> when you think, that in spite of all of this, we were able to raise our voice, we should</p><p> walk now with our heads high, too. And I often say I'm very proud to be who I am. I</p><p> wouldn't change it for the world. And I am proud of being a Jew. And I am proud of</p><p> having to sur-survive -- of having survived. But until recently, I had enormous guilt.</p><p>The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I felt enormous guilt for surviving. Why me?

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- any more information?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, you know, I went back to my hometown and that was a disaster. As I said, my</p><p> sister apparently was shot then and there, I don't know what day, or -- but, during the</p><p> liquidation. My father, at first they told me he was -- he pa -- I guess the people in my</p><p> town -- excuse me, that he went to Dachau, the concentration -- Dachau concentration</p><p> camp. And when I was in the DP camp, and later when my husband and I were</p><p> stationed in Munich -- excuse me -- we went to Dachau to search all the papers. Didn't</p><p> find anything. And then, when I went in 1988 to my hometown, I was told that the 300</p><p> leaders were led from our hometown to the outside of the town to a -- one of the forests,</p><p> there are lots of forests around. I don't know if they kept them one day or two or three.</p><p> They made them dig a mass grave and then they shot them there and then. I don't know</p><p> which is the true story. I did not see the grave. I hope before I die I will go back to my</p><p> hometown and have answers to some of these burning questions. Maybe not all of</p><p> them, but some. If there is a grave, I feel that's probably where he lost his life. I -- and</p><p> if it's so, I -- my aim is to put some plaques, memorial plaques where the ghetto was,</p><p> which is now a leveled space, and I hope someone will show me the mass grave, and I</p><p> could put some memorial plaque there.</p><p>The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you have reason to believe that people there know where it is?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yes, they do. They told us they do, but we had no time to go there --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- because I was given a limit of two hours to be there. And the town was completely</p><p> leveled. My house is still there, which again doesn't look like my house, but it was a</p><p> very traumatic return to my hometown. Nothing was the way I remembered it and most</p><p> of the houses were gone and I don't know, but my -- our theory is that there must have</p><p> been some kind of a experiment which turned sour. I'm not saying it was Chernobyl or</p><p> anything, but -- I don't know what it was, but something occurred in that little town of</p><p> mine that leveled everything and there is nothing there now. When we went in "88, my</p><p> husband tried to comfort me cause I was so upset with all this. He says, well, you don't</p><p> see anything, let's go and show me where the river is where you were hiding with your</p><p> mama. And I try -- I said, I -- I s -- I was so disoriented, and I asked the people there,</p><p> where's the river? No more river, they diverted the river, too. So, I mean, everything</p><p> was so traumatic and so puzzling, to this day I don't know if any of the facts or if</p><p> anything they said is the truth, but I have to believe someone. But there is, they told me,</p><p> a mass grave outside of the city.</p></p></dialogue>
