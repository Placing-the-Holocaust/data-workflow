So</p><p> he sent word out to New York that he would be prepared to move a Jewish couple</p><p> down to Savannah and get them lodging, if the -- the man in the family would take</p><p> over the running of the pawn shop. And he interviewed my father, and he felt my</p><p> father was qualified, and my father had recently been married to my mother, who</p><p> came over from Lithuania to -- I think she was encouraged to come over to meet</p><p> my father, but I wasn't there, so I don't know anything about that. Anyway, they</p><p> did get married and go -- and went down to Savannah, and s-so that's where I was</p><p> born, and my three younger siblings were born there, too. Eventually the pawn shop</p><p> turned into a large department store, and my father became the manager of the</p><p> department store.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><p> -- you leave. I mean, what are the conditions of the first time that you leave, how did</p><p> it happen? It sounds like from what you've told me so far, the picture that's been</p><p> painted, it kind of comes out of the blue. Why would she want to leave?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The reason my mother wanted to leave, as far as I can understand it, was really</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> very simple one. She had a father in Zarasai. She had a sister, Liefa(ph) in</p><p> Zarasai, who was married to Moysai(ph) and -- and they had a son, Danke(ph),</p><p> Daniel, and -- and she had friends that she had left behind. So she convinced my</p><p> father that she would just like to go for a visit. Now of course, I wasn't old enough</p><p> to know -- to be privy to their conversation, did she say to him, I want to go for a</p><p> month, or two weeks. There must have been some kind of time limit discussed.</p><p> Well, all I know is, the time was dragged on and on and on.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The first time I -- I saw New York. And ostensibly, we were in New York,</p><p> where the ship would be, and we stayed with relatives. And it was exciting for me,</p><p> but also terrifying, because my mother took all of us -- well, there were four of us.</p><p> The youngest, David, must have been around six months old, I mean, he was very --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: A baby.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- he was a baby.

Well, I couldn't wait to get out of there, and then</p><p> we wound up at some Muma's(ph) place, an aunt. And -- and that also was kind of</p><p> crazy, because these were not mansions. They were lit -- tiny little apartments in --</p><p> in poor neighborhoods, and all the people squeezed into one big room, you know.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, my father sent money regularly. As a matter of fact, she was constantly</p><p> telling us to write to our father that we are desperate for money, that we have no</p><p> food. And later my father told me, I was sending money -- he had postal receipts</p><p> that he showed me, about that high. He was sending money all the time. But she</p><p> was also giving money away. She believed in the Talmudic, or Torah thing about</p><p> Tzedakah, which is giving to the poor. And whoever -- who-whoever she found out</p><p> about through the synagogue or people she knew, that so and so was desperately out</p><p> of money and couldn't survive, she would give them a chunk of money.

But very -- I--I--I remember when I mo</p><p> -- came back from Lithuania and moved -- moved in -- my father and I shared a r --</p><p> a room, and rented a room in the Bronx. And the building I lived in, I made friends</p><p> with a couple of Jewish kids, and they warned me not to go on certain streets, where</p><p> the Italians lived, and on another street where the Irish lived. And it wasn't that</p><p> there were -- they were -- none of these streets had a hundred percent Jews, a</p><p> hundred percent Irish, a hundred percent Italian, but they were predominantly of</p><p> one ethnic or religious group.

<dialogue class=""><p><p> things, that struck you as the strangest things you'd ever seen? Because you'd come</p><p> from a different world. You'd come from -- I mean, Savannah is certainly different</p><p> than New York City, but that's the world of the United States, and you come to</p><p> this one, and you've mentioned that it's like being in pre-history, but what was the</p><p> strangest thing that you saw?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The strangest thing to me in Zarasai on my first experience was the lack of</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> automobiles. There was not a single automobile. In fact, when one would be coming</p><p> in from Kovno, that we had heard about, all the kids would gather to run after the</p><p> car. And we used to stand behind the car to smell the gasoline from the exhaust,</p><p> because it was such an unusual smell. And that struck me. The other thing was that</p><p> you could find food on trees everywhere. All you had to do was walk in a certain</p><p> area where the apple tree was hanging over the street, and get a stick and hit it, and</p><p> get an apple and eat it, or a pear, or a bunch of cherries.

What was he --</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He -- he interceded on behalf of Jewish people who needed to go to court about</p><p> s-some -- some matter. It -- it wasn't things like divorce, or -- or suing a storekeeper.</p><p> What it was, I think, is these people received a notice that there was a-- some kind</p><p> of violation.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, you know, this is one of the reasons why earlier, when we were talking</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> about relations between Jews and non-Jews, and whatever your personal experience</p><p> might have been in Zarasai, I wanted to get a sense of how you viewed whatever</p><p> was going on there, in the context of other places, because if -- if the message is that</p><p> this was just as normal, you had a normal kind of life there, as there could be in any</p><p> other place, that means that -- that means a very spooky thing. That means that you</p><p> put the right kind of forces together, and these things can happen anywhere. They</p><p> didn't ha -- genocide didn't happen everywhere. It happened in particular places,</p><p> within a hor -- historical context, when there was a final solution.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But it's the ingredients in the cauldron.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. I think self-preservation is a consuming motivation, because you either --</p><p> the thinking among certain people who are very scared of everything, if you don't</p><p> join them, you become the victims. You -- your choice is to join the bad guys, or die</p><p> as the good guy.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oftentimes, that is how people saw things.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I just can't picture being with a large armed Jewish group, out to have</p><p> sport by killing Gypsies, or some other unfavored -- black people, you know. I --I</p><p> just can't picture even entertaining such a notion, it's -- it's -- it's so preposterous.</p><p> And yet, there are people who get down to where they say to themselves, if-- if I</p><p> don't join that gang, the gang is gonna kill me, so | better join the gang. That's how</p><p> gangs recruit people, they threaten them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And I think it would be very easy to threaten a non-educated farmer in</p><p> Lithuania and tell him, if you don't get rid of the Jews in the next farm, we're</p><p> gonna burn your farm down, you know.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Thank God it's not me they're after, you know. It takes a lot of courage to stand</p><p> up with the persecuted and say, you want to do things to them, you do them to me,</p><p> too.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- you can pick a victim anywhere you look. But no, we're all part of the same</p><p> race, we're human beings and we need to treat each other that way. Of course, I'm</p><p> only, you know, sounding off about something that's -- everyone knows is a basic</p><p> truism. But it bears repeating. I mean, I'm not ashamed that I repeat myself with</p><p> these kinds of things. Yes, we're all in it together. It's one world, we're all brothers,</p><p> we're all eating -- eating and drinking and -- and trying to preserve things for our</p><p> children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren and the millions of others who</p><p> are yet to come. And hopefully, by example, we can -- by doing something about it,</p><p> by at least talking about things, showing how bad things are not to be -- that</p><p> shouldn't be repeated, perhaps someday it'll happen, that people will no longer hate</p><p> each other.</p></p></dialogue>

And so we're either gonna</p><p> have to get along together, or perish together, eventually. I mean, I know a lot of</p><p> people say I won't live long enough to see the horrors of -- 0-0-of -- of global</p><p> warming. And in my case that's certainly true, I-- I mean, I don't have to worry</p><p> about it happening in the next 25 years, because I'm not going to be here in 25</p><p> years. But my great-grandchildren, whom I love dearly, will be here in 25 years,</p><p> and I want them to have a future, as I want everybody's children and grandchildren</p><p> and great-grandchildren to have.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay, so we started talking about a few things off camera, that I really asked if</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> we would be able to repeat on camera. So this is going to be an accretion to the</p><p> interview with Mr. Al Jaffee on May 21", by the U.S. Holocaust Museum, and we</p><p> were talking about -- about legacies in some ways, so if you could -- if you could</p><p> give me a sense of what is it that you got from having lived in Zarasai that you</p><p> couldn't have here, and what is it that you got from here that you couldn't have</p><p> there?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, what an interesting question. I can quickly tell you what I brought from here</p><p> to Zarasai, and how -- how it helped me integrate into s -- z -- the children's society</p><p> of Zarasai. First of all, most of the little guys that I met in Zarasai had never seen a</p><p> train, a plane. They have seen maybe one or two automobiles in their lifetime so far:</p><p> they were six or seven years old. But there's -- there's so much that never arrived in</p><p> Zarasai for them. And I would regale them with stories about subway trains that</p><p> arrive every five minutes and 2,000 people shove their way in, and go to work.</p></p></dialogue>

And -- but they -- you know, their mouths would</p><p> hang open, and they would ask questions: how fast does this train go, and is it above</p><p> the ground? And I said, well, some of them are above ground; they're known as the</p><p> elevated tracks, and some are subways, they go underground. And there's a new</p><p> train every 10 - 15 minutes. And the kids would say to me, how many trains are</p><p> there? And I would say oh, there are -- they go around the whole city, and it's just a</p><p> continuous train tr -- bunch of trains every 10 - 15 minutes. And I would tell them</p><p> about trips I had taken in buses and cars and with my father. And air -- airplanes that</p><p> we watched take off and land. And they -- they were staggered with -- with curiosity.</p><p> And -- but then, I learned a lot from them.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The -- I learned a lot of how you -- in Zarasai you didn't have Woolworth's and</p><p> other stores that you could go in and buy whatever device you needed. If you</p><p> needed a device, you either made it, or you went without. And the way to find out</p><p> how to make it was to consult the local people. My friend Karowlka(ph) taught me</p><p> a lot of things; how to -- how -- how to -- I'Il give you an example of something -- to</p><p> go fishing was a -- a very interesting occ -- pri-- you know, business for us, and --</p><p> because the town was surrounded by lakes. But you need a fishing pole. Well, that's</p><p> very easy. You go to the local woods, and you find a sapling that's just the right</p><p> length and the right size, and you cut it down, and that's your fishing pole. Now you</p><p> need fishing line. Well, you can't use just anything. But there are white horses, and</p><p> white horses have long, white tails, and you just pull out a few strands here and</p><p> there, and you braid them, and it turns into the -- a-and then you -- you have like a --</p><p> maybe a two or three foot length, and you get about six or seven of those, and now</p><p> you have a terrific fishing line. The -- the bobber is simple, a goose quill and a cork,</p><p> and you put a hole in the cork and you put the goose quill through it, and then you The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

So we went</p><p> fishing all the time with these things, and we caught the fish, we fried the fish and</p><p> we ate the fish and we had a wonderful time. But we also -- you could buy sleds in</p><p> the wintertime, but my brother Harry and I loved to play -- play with wood, and we</p><p> would make our own sleds, they were simple things, but -- but we di-- we didn't</p><p> bother wi -- sl-sleds were really so cheap that we were able to get a few pennies to</p><p> buy sleds.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You made your own ice skates?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We made our own ice skates because all it took was le-leather straps, a piece of</p><p> wood, and then you go to the local blacksmith and he puts a little strip of iron</p><p> underneath as -- as a runner. And you put the straps -- nail the straps to the piece of</p><p> wood, and you put it on your feet. It worked. I mean, we went ice skating with these</p><p> things and had a wonderful time. So, we learned how -- we learned how to swim, we</p><p> learned how to ice skate, we learned how -- how to catch fish. In the wintertime we</p><p> got -- we got sp -- poles that were similar to our fishing poles, only heavier, and we</p><p> put a --a spear at the end of it, and you could spear fish through holes made in the</p><p> ice. So -- but all these things were local lore, and you ask people, and they showed</p><p> you how to do it, and then you did it, and -- also, there were no street lights.

So we</p><p> never went hungry, because the whole town had nothing but apple trees and pear</p><p> trees and plum trees, and -- depending on what time of the season, we could always</p><p> get something to eat that way.
