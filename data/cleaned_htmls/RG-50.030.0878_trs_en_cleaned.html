So</p><p> he sent word out to New York that he would be prepared to move a Jewish couple</p><p> down to Savannah and get them lodging, if the -- the man in the family would take</p><p> over the running of the pawn shop. And he interviewed my father, and he felt my</p><p> father was qualified, and my father had recently been married to my mother, who</p><p> came over from Lithuania to -- I think she was encouraged to come over to meet</p><p> my father, but I wasn't there, so I don't know anything about that. Anyway, they</p><p> did get married and go -- and went down to Savannah, and s-so that's where I was</p><p> born, and my three younger siblings were born there, too. Eventually the pawn shop</p><p> turned into a large department store, and my father became the manager of the</p><p> department store.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p> newspapers that he would read?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, there was a local paper -- papers, but I -- I don't remember the -- the names</p><p> of the papers. My only interest in those papers were the Sunday funnies, and the</p><p> daily funnies as well. My brother Harry and I were crazy about the cartoons,</p><p> because we were bo-both had art talent.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Tell me a little bit about -- now let's get to -- to the part where -- where you</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> -- you leave. I mean, what are the conditions of the first time that you leave, how did</p><p> it happen? It sounds like from what you've told me so far, the picture that's been</p><p> painted, it kind of comes out of the blue. Why would she want to leave?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The reason my mother wanted to leave, as far as I can understand it, was really</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> very simple one. She had a father in Zarasai. She had a sister, Liefa(ph) in</p><p> Zarasai, who was married to Moysai(ph) and -- and they had a son, Danke(ph),</p><p> Daniel, and -- and she had friends that she had left behind. So she convinced my</p><p> father that she would just like to go for a visit. Now of course, I wasn't old enough</p><p> to know -- to be privy to their conversation, did she say to him, I want to go for a</p><p> month, or two weeks. There must have been some kind of time limit discussed.</p><p> Well, all I know is, the time was dragged on and on and on.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When did you leave, by the way, what year was it, do you know?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: 1926.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you were four years old -- five years old.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The first time I -- I saw New York. And ostensibly, we were in New York,</p><p> where the ship would be, and we stayed with relatives. And it was exciting for me,</p><p> but also terrifying, because my mother took all of us -- well, there were four of us.</p><p> The youngest, David, must have been around six months old, I mean, he was very --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: A baby.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- he was a baby.

Well, I couldn't wait to get out of there, and then</p><p> we wound up at some Muma's(ph) place, an aunt. And -- and that also was kind of</p><p> crazy, because these were not mansions. They were lit -- tiny little apartments in --</p><p> in poor neighborhoods, and all the people squeezed into one big room, you know.</p></p></dialogue>

And he would explain it to -- he was very bright, and he would explain it to</p><p> me, and little by little I picked it up, and before long -- you know, kids can learn</p><p> things very quickly through experience rather than by rote.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, my father sent money regularly. As a matter of fact, she was constantly</p><p> telling us to write to our father that we are desperate for money, that we have no</p><p> food. And later my father told me, I was sending money -- he had postal receipts</p><p> that he showed me, about that high. He was sending money all the time. But she</p><p> was also giving money away. She believed in the Talmudic, or Torah thing about</p><p> Tzedakah, which is giving to the poor. And whoever -- who-whoever she found out</p><p> about through the synagogue or people she knew, that so and so was desperately out</p><p> of money and couldn't survive, she would give them a chunk of money. So I--I</p><p> didn't object to that really, except, you know, we all have the feeling of, your first</p><p> duty is at home.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p> did you go to?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My mother sent us to a cheder, which I hated and I stopped going to it, because I</p><p> was not interested in the religious part of it.

<dialogue class=""><p> was -- what were the instruction like, what were the teachers like?

But I enjoyed</p><p> having the tutor because my mother hired a--a very bright young man who not only</p><p> went through the Bible and made it -- made the Bible stories interesting, like Noah's</p><p> ark and stuff like that, but he also dealt with science, and explained science and</p><p> geography.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, it --I can't say it was anti-Semitism. Maybe from the neighborhood that I</p><p> lived in. You know, people of similar interests tend to congregate. It -- people of</p><p> color, of course, were segregated by color. But very -- I--I--I remember when I mo</p><p> -- came back from Lithuania and moved -- moved in -- my father and I shared a r --</p><p> a room, and rented a room in the Bronx. And the building I lived in, I made friends</p><p> with a couple of Jewish kids, and they warned me not to go on certain streets, where</p><p> the Italians lived, and on another street where the Irish lived. And it wasn't that</p><p> there were -- they were -- none of these streets had a hundred percent Jews, a</p><p> hundred percent Irish, a hundred percent Italian, but they were predominantly of</p><p> one ethnic or religious group. And if you -- if I walked to school on the wrong</p><p> street, I'd be sure to get beaten up. I was chased, and I found out. So then, after</p><p> being chased, my friend Hilton said, never go on that street. They'll catch you,</p><p> they" ll -- they'll take your shoes, they'll take everything away from you.

We s -- we stayed pretty much in the Jewish areas. Now, that's not to say</p><p> that there weren't some Gentiles living in Jewish areas, and some Jews living in</p><p> Gentile areas. There are people who find acceptance because they integrate and</p><p> they're not threatening, and they -- they just don't develop friendships, they don't</p><p> eat at each other's houses and thing -- they don't have coffee klatches, but they</p><p> leave each other alone.

<dialogue class=""><p><p> things, that struck you as the strangest things you'd ever seen? Because you'd come</p><p> from a different world.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The strangest thing to me in Zarasai on my first experience was the lack of</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> automobiles. There was not a single automobile.

And we used to stand behind the car to smell the gasoline from the exhaust,</p><p> because it was such an unusual smell. And that struck me. The other thing was that</p><p> you could find food on trees everywhere. All you had to do was walk in a certain</p><p> area where the apple tree was hanging over the street, and get a stick and hit it, and</p><p> get an apple and eat it, or a pear, or a bunch of cherries.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, I think about it periodically. It's -- it's unfinished -- it's unfinished,</p><p> important in -- life story. But you know, our defenses rise up. You -- in order to</p><p> survive, you can't dwell on -- on horror of the past, or a-any -- anything. You just</p><p> have to move on.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, you know, it sounds to me like you lost your mother more than one time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> You lost her in a very personal way, as a family, as a mother, and then you lost her</p><p> because there was the Holocaust.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. [had heard that, like in all the countries of Europe, and that includes Italy</p><p> and Spain and Bulgaria; and you just name them all: Hungary, Romania, they all</p><p> had local Nazi sympathizers. And so the -- the story I heard was, once the Germans</p><p> came in, even in a small group, and empowered the local se -- sympathizers, they</p><p> had people joining their group, local bigots, anti-Semites, or what have you,</p><p> opportunists, and they just did what the Germans wanted them to do.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It did happen.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p> or Zarasai in particular.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In sizi-- yes, I heard about Zarasai.

And then they were all rounded up and taken</p><p> to the woods that I loved, where I used to get my fishing poles, and pick</p><p> strawberries, the little ones.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: They're delicious.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They're wonderful, the little, tiny things. And we used to get baskets full of</p><p> them. And well la -- you know, it was like Huckleberry Finn, I'm te -- I'm telling</p><p> you, Tom Sawyer. And we lived the good life when -- you know, when we were</p><p> able to go to these things. So th-the story is that they cut off the exit from town on</p><p> the main road, and then rounded them up and took them to the woods and killed</p><p> them. And this di-- not only happened in Lithuania, it happened in Poland, it</p><p> happened in Hungary, Romania, Yugoslavia, every -- you know, everywhere. It's</p><p> a strange kind of opportunism to curry favor by killing people, but that's what</p><p> people did.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: There's some things that we try to find answers for, and sometimes we find</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, because we just don't expect human beings to behave in an inhuman way,</p><p> and -- but they do, oth -- if they didn't, we wouldn't have any more wars.</p><p>The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, you know, this is one of the reasons why earlier, when we were talking</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> about relations between Jews and non-Jews, and whatever your personal experience</p><p> might have been in Zarasai, I wanted to get a sense of how you viewed whatever</p><p> was going on there, in the context of other places, because if -- if the message is that</p><p> this was just as normal, you had a normal kind of life there, as there could be in any</p><p> other place, that means that -- that means a very spooky thing. That means that you</p><p> put the right kind of forces together, and these things can happen anywhere. They</p><p> didn't ha -- genocide didn't happen everywhere. It happened in particular places,</p><p> within a hor -- historical context, when there was a final solution.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But it's the ingredients in the cauldron.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. I think self-preservation is a consuming motivation, because you either --</p><p> the thinking among certain people who are very scared of everything, if you don't</p><p> join them, you become the victims. You -- your choice is to join the bad guys, or die</p><p> as the good guy.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I still think that there is --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I just can't picture being with a large armed Jewish group, out to have</p><p> sport by killing Gypsies, or some other unfavored -- black people, you know. I --I</p><p> just can't picture even entertaining such a notion, it's -- it's -- it's so preposterous.</p><p> And yet, there are people who get down to where they say to themselves, if-- if I</p><p> don't join that gang, the gang is gonna kill me, so | better join the gang. That's how</p><p> gangs recruit people, they threaten them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And I think it would be very easy to threaten a non-educated farmer in</p><p> Lithuania and tell him, if you don't get rid of the Jews in the next farm, we're</p><p> gonna burn your farm down, you know.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Thank God it's not me they're after, you know. It takes a lot of courage to stand</p><p> up with the persecuted and say, you want to do things to them, you do them to me,</p><p> too.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- you can pick a victim anywhere you look.

Of course, I'm</p><p> only, you know, sounding off about something that's -- everyone knows is a basic</p><p> truism. But it bears repeating. I mean, I'm not ashamed that I repeat myself with</p><p> these kinds of things. Yes, we're all in it together.

<dialogue class=""><p> we would be able to repeat on camera. So this is going to be an accretion to the</p><p> interview with Mr. Al Jaffee on May 21", by the U.S. Holocaust Museum, and we</p><p> were talking about -- about legacies in some ways, so if you could -- if you could</p><p> give me a sense of what is it that you got from having lived in Zarasai that you</p><p> couldn't have here, and what is it that you got from here that you couldn't have</p><p> there?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, what an interesting question. I can quickly tell you what I brought from here</p><p> to Zarasai, and how -- how it helped me integrate into s -- z -- the children's society</p><p> of Zarasai. First of all, most of the little guys that I met in Zarasai had never seen a</p><p> train, a plane. They have seen maybe one or two automobiles in their lifetime so far:</p><p> they were six or seven years old. But there's -- there's so much that never arrived in</p><p> Zarasai for them. And I would regale them with stories about subway trains that</p><p> arrive every five minutes and 2,000 people shove their way in, and go to work.</p></p></dialogue>

And I said, well, some of them are above ground; they're known as the</p><p> elevated tracks, and some are subways, they go underground. And there's a new</p><p> train every 10 - 15 minutes.

And I would say oh, there are -- they go around the whole city, and it's just a</p><p> continuous train tr -- bunch of trains every 10 - 15 minutes. And I would tell them</p><p> about trips I had taken in buses and cars and with my father. And air -- airplanes that</p><p> we watched take off and land.

If you</p><p> needed a device, you either made it, or you went without. And the way to find out</p><p> how to make it was to consult the local people.

But you need a fishing pole. Well, that's</p><p> very easy. You go to the local woods, and you find a sapling that's just the right</p><p> length and the right size, and you cut it down, and that's your fishing pole. Now you</p><p> need fishing line. Well, you can't use just anything. But there are white horses, and</p><p> white horses have long, white tails, and you just pull out a few strands here and</p><p> there, and you braid them, and it turns into the -- a-and then you -- you have like a --</p><p> maybe a two or three foot length, and you get about six or seven of those, and now</p><p> you have a terrific fishing line.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You made your own ice skates?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We made our own ice skates because all it took was le-leather straps, a piece of</p><p> wood, and then you go to the local blacksmith and he puts a little strip of iron</p><p> underneath as -- as a runner. And you put the straps -- nail the straps to the piece of</p><p> wood, and you put it on your feet. It worked. I mean, we went ice skating with these</p><p> things and had a wonderful time. So, we learned how -- we learned how to swim, we</p><p> learned how to ice skate, we learned how -- how to catch fish.
