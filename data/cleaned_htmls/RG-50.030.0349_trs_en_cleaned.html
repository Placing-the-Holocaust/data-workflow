<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell me a little bit about your family -- your family and your life before the war.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: My father was born in Romania in 1894 and he left Romania in 1910. And on his way to America he stopped in Paris and stayed there. And after World War I -- he was in the French Foreign Legion during World War I -- he went back to Romania, married my mother, took her to Paris. And so I was born in Paris, my sister was born in Paris. And before the war, life was -- the life of Jewish immigrants in France -- tolerated. I wouldn't say affluent, but well-to-do. Until the recession. And we didn't have major problems in terms of intolerance and suspicion of being a foreigner until really the mid -- late 30's. Very, very shortly before the war. Very shortly. And that came about, of course, with in Germany. And a -- the beginning of, or maybe the renewal <span class="page-break" number="0"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. No. No. Just like so many Jewish families before the war, religion was not -- all our friends -- religion was not an important -- well, we -- young people would be -- yes -- respect it, but we would get gifts at Christmas. And we had bread for Pesach. We had matzo and bread at the same time on the table. We ate pork.</p><p> So we were very . And all our friends were the same. But we -- culturally, we were very, <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> people, who were all first cousin of the Czar, of course, you know. So it was colorful, it was colorful. That was, you know, until -- untilthe sof "35- "36. That was the turning point.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can we just ask you another question? You had mentioned Jewish cultural and political activities. Where you or your family involved in them? Were you Zionists?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. No. No. No. We -- we -- just like all the Jewish family we had the blue piggy bank of the where we would put money in it and somebody from the would come once a month and <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> And we lost track of him -- but -- and so they told us what was going on. They told us. I don't remember being in contact with German Jews, but Austrian Jews, yes. Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was -- what was your reaction to this? This information you were getting?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Uh, well, we -- I know my parents were very, very upset. Very, very upset. And we were looking at Hitler as -- as a danger. But at the same time, being in France, you know, the traditional enemy of Germany, the strong French Army. We felt very secure. Well, if they move, we're going to leave them and Hitler is going to go back to Bohemia, or wherever he came from. That was the feeling in France. Very few people were aware of what happened. Very few.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you weren't particularly threatened?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We -- we -- we were not -- no -- not by the French, no. No. No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But by the Germans?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Germany was -- was a danger for -- for the world. People were talking about re-armament of Germany and so forth, but at the same time, we -- we -- as I say, you know, we were feeling that we had the Maginot line protecting us, that the French Army was so strong, that we had the best weapons, and so forth. And all that propaganda of the French government, trying to -- not trying -- but -- I believe they believed that, themselves, you know. They believed that, yes, the Maginot line was very strong, that the French engineers were building the best tanks, and building the best airplane, and the French Army was invincible.</p><p>The navy was the second in the world, and so forth. So -- and -- yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When did you learn differently?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: At the defeat of France, 1940.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What happened?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, when the French Army collapsed and all of a sudden German soldiers were invading France, that's -- that's when we felt the impact of defeat. And the danger of an enemy of France and the Jews at the same time. So -- so we were threatened on two aspects. So it was really a feeling of total despair and fear all of a sudden.</p><p>This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

A different reality. And we had to adjust to that different reality.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember when the Germans occupied Paris?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, we left Paris the 10th of June in 1940. We were among the last to leave Paris. Everybody was leaving. And -- well, we were just outside of Paris in that place where we spent the first two years of the war. And the --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Can you describe to me the German occupation of Paris? The initial -- the first days.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was not there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was not there. No, I can describe the German occupation of Brittany -- the first days. Where -- it was about the 15th or 16th of June and we had reached that small place in Brittany. Peaceful, beautiful medieval town with old, walled medieval town and it was beautiful, beautiful summer -- oh, spring. And it was the first time that we really were out so -- that far from Paris in a couple of years or so. And it was very nice.</p><p>Very, very nice. Beautiful landscape and the smell of country. And so we used to walk in the evening around that -- that small city.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What's the name of the city?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>A . And in the distance we could see -- on the road in the distance -- moving side cars -- <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> road -- they were looking absolutely -- they were awful. They were raw, military power. And of course, I understood that years later, when I was myself in the Army, the people who are sent like that are the best. They are the people who can analyze a situation and take action and so forth. So they passed by us, and I remember we were walking by the barracks of the French Gendarmes and it was a hot evening and they had like a balcony at the barracks there with the sien and the <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- was that because you all felt it was safer because the Germans had already arrived?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, it was -- was -- was also because the battlefront was getting close to us. And the day that we left -- we were living outside Paris and it was like a development, we -- I mean, little cottages, and a garden. It was our second home, actually. And we could hear the gun all night long -- guns -- big guns. Big guns, artillery. Which were close to us. And German planes flying all over and so forth. And then in the morning when we got up, at the end of the streets -- of the street there, a company, or a platoon of French infantry. And they were colonial troops. They were Senegalese.</p><p>They were in foxholes with -- looked like a battle was going to take place right there. So we fled.</p><p>We fled. And our neighbor -- next-door neighbor -- was from that place and she say, Okay, we'll take -- her son was fighting -- and she's saying, Okay, let's go to my sister's in Brittany. So we took the train. The trains were still working. You know, it's crazy -- stuff is absolutely crazy. So the trains were working, we got to Paris. We had to change railroad station -- we went from to . <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not -- no, no. They entered Paris, I believe, June the 15th. We were -- actually, we didn't have to leave that area but we didn't know that at the time, see. Those soldiers who -- Paris was an open city. Was declared an open city. So the defense around Paris was canceled by the French military people or -- I don't know, maybe they just fled, you know. But one of the last major battles of Paris took place maybe ten kilometers from where we were. In the forest -- it's a dense -- at the time, it was a dense forest. Part of that big forest going from all the way to and <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> don't recall exactly, but they might have a box on that form, or one way to ask if you were Jewish or not. But I'm not quite sure. But anyway, to get on that train, you needed a pass from the Germans.</p><p>And we got there, we got into Paris. And that's when the impact also -- we left Paris and and Paris a month earlier was Paris -- you know, the buses, and the cars, and the taxis and no German. And all of a sudden, there were very few buses, no taxis -- now taxis were just for the Germans. There were very few taxis which were reserved simply for the Germans. And Germans everywhere, in all kinds of uniforms. All kinds. And they had taken thes cafe and that wasa--_--__ and this and that, and restaurant . And they had posters with propaganda and warnings. It was a sad picture. A very sad picture. And so many -- so many business were -- were still closed down.</p><p>People had not returned. So we arrived there and the Metro was working -- Metro was working. So we took the Metro. Went to the other station, took the train and went back home. That was July, 1940. And life was -- life was as usual, at least temporarily. Until -- I'm trying to remember if it was September of that year that -- that was the German who asked -- the census of the Jews. But the census was done by the French. And my father had to go to . was the <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0 general population. We had absolutely no discrimination at that time, either from the Germans or the French. Absolutely none. None. Then in 1942, that's when things started to change drastically.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: All of this time between fall of 1940 and "42, your life was relatively normal?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Absolutely.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In Paris?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Outside of Paris. The</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay. You -- okay, I'm sorry, because I didn't under -- I don't think you told me that you had goneto.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, that was at the beginning of the war, in 1939. We were afraid of Paris being bombarded, so -- and the French government asked people who had family in the provinces or a secondary home outside of Paris to leave -- most of the big cities. They asked most of the big cities, but essentially Paris. They did the same in England, by the way, at the beginning of the war. And they sent the children all over the place and some of them were sent to England also -- to the United States -- English children -- and Canada. So -- so we had that second home, and we moved there. We moved there. At first my father was still keeping his business in Paris. And the business was not good anymore. So -- and he was known locally, so he found a -- he found enough to do locally.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did you have to identify yourselves as Jews? Did you have to wear a star? Did you --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No. Not from 1940, until 1942.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you still had good relations with your neighbors or Christian friends at school?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Absolutely. Absolutely. Absolutely. It was -- life was -- was very normal. Very normal. Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. So you were saying that this went on until sometime in 1942?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I'm trying to remember if -- I believe in 1941 they arrested -- they started to arrest Jews in Paris.</p><p>I believe that was when they put them in the there. I believe that was July, "41. <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 1 A. "42? Okay. Okay. So that was the turning point. When -- when -- July, "42, when -- yes, yes, that's July, "42. Because my sister was spending the night in Paris with some friends of ours during that night when they came to arrest people. And they -- the friends were living almost at the top of the building and they could hear the police in the middle of the night, climbing the stairs, knocking on the doors, and so forth. So their next-door neighbor, who was Christian, got them in their apartment. And that's why -- that's how my sister was able to escape that night. So -- so shortly after that -- no, before that -- shortly before that --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Let me interrupt you. Because I think for the record, when you say the Velodrome, I don't think that somebody watching this tape might know what you're talking about. I mean, I know what you're talking about --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- but somebody else may not.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Okay. ___ was a indoor stadium in Paris, built around the turn of the century, essentially for bicycle races. That's where they have the six days of Paris. Like the six days of -- I don't remember where, but it was very popular at the turn of the century. And it went on for maybe 50 or 60 years.</p><p>And people would go there for six days. They would bring food and so forth and they would watch those -- those people would race around like squirrels for six days. And so that stadium was big enough to accommodate -- not accommodate -- not accommodate -- but to sit maybe two, three thousand people. And when the French police arrested the Jews in Paris for the first time on a large scale after the agreements between the French government and the Vichy government and the Germans, they had not made provisions to house such a large population. So they decided to park them in that stadium, which was called . And -- because it was the winter one -- it was <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 2 believe it helped later on, to a certain extent, to open the eyes of French people and try to help the Jews in the future. Or at least to avoid being involved. And they really saw that, and the Catholic charities also were involved. And so it became a big controversy among the French people. They didn't realize that discrimination could be that bad. And some were pleased, of course. Saying "Well, the Jews deserved that." But I don't believe they were a majority. I don't believe that. So that's the___------.~Which means the winter -- how do you say -- velodrome -- bicycle track.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: As opposed to summer.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And once people were taken there -- once the Jews were rounded -- of Paris were rounded up and taken there --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So -- so then the French government decided that they would use a place called.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>And was a huge public housing project which was not complete in 1941 or "42. So they transferred the Jewish population from__--stto_--~XAnd______ became, really, the first -- the first stop to Auschwitz in the history of the persecution of the Jews in occupied France. And we knew people who were there. Some -- some people were released from . But the <span class="page-break" number="11"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 3</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You said that this was a real turning point in people's perception -- in non-Jewish people's perception. Up until then, were they fairly respectful of the occupation and of the Vichy government?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. No. Not -- not in the occupied zone. In the occupied zone, the feelings were either, well, we are defeated, we have to survive, we have to -- we have to just, you know, go with the crowd.</p><p>Or there were others who were saying, well, we are going to build a new Europe, a new world. And we have to -- we have to get rid of the Jews and the Free Mason and Communism -- Communism, that was the Bolsheviks. And then there were the people who were either openly against the Germans and Vichy or secretly against the Germans and Vichy. And the French -- the French, basically, are -- they hate the Germans just as much as the Germans hate the French. It's a tragedy of history that two nations which are so different have a -- are neighbors. And even to this day, France and Germany, yes, they are big friends, but, no. No. They are very, very different. And the feelings -- the feelings of the French are still anti-German.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you began to say in "42 with this massive round-up in Paris, things started changing for you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>You were living in . <span class="page-break" number="12"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 4 what was going on. | -- | -- I had the feeling -- and I knew -- I didn't know exactly, but the Royal Air Force would drop leaflets over France, which was called the . And it was like a little newsletter, printed on very, very thin paper, but strong paper. And they would drop that by the thousands. And they had that warning for the Jews, talking about the group, and the Jews who were gassed in trucks. And that was, I believe that was in early April of that year that I got that -- one night we heard the planes above our head, and the next morning we had those flyers in our garden. And we were not supposed to pick them up. We were supposed to call the German immediately. But -- so we read that, and I became very, very, very tense. But the propaganda from Jewish people was that, don't listen. That's not true. How can the Germans, such a civilized nation, do things like that? No. They just want to send the Jews in camps to work. Why elderly people and children work in camp, though. So -- so -- so -- my -- my parents were trying to -- to believe that, see, because, it was -- where could we go? We had no place -- we didn't know. So the pressure on my father was such -- and on friends also was such -- that he got in touch with people who were working in the diamond business. And the diamond business, they were very chummy with the Germans. The Germans were dealing in diamonds, and gold, and so forth. And the only people they could deal with were the Jewish people who were in that business. And so -- I don't know all the details because I was not curious at the time -- but my father got in touch with an organization through that -- one of the diamond dealer -- where we would cross from occupied France into non-occupied France on a regular train. And one person, I believe he was German, had those pass. those -- those made in our name. And so the day that we left, which was <span class="page-break" number="12"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 5</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You said you were staying at a neighbor's house.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes, we were staying at neighbor house. The same neighbor who took us to her sister in Brittany. And -- and I was going to school in Paris at the time. I decided that Paris was the safest.</p><p>Because nobody knew me in Paris. I would take the train early in the morning, it was dark, and that was like a -- not exactly boarding school, but I took one meal there and I would come at night and when I was in that school I was safe. It was called __----_--.:_ It was a very old college which Loyola attended in the 1500's. It was a private school, they didn't care, they didn't ask any questions and I was not wearing my -- the star. And I never wanted to wear the star, I took a chance, but I never -- didn't wear it. So I was going to that school and was trying to blend with the rest of the people.</p><p>And no question asked, absolutely nothing. It was -- the other people and, you know. And so -- but when I was going back home, the pressure was there. So anyway, my father got that -- into that organization and the day that we were leaving, that's the day they came to arrest us. But they didn't have enough people to arrest us, so what they were doing, they sent a cop and asking us to go to the precinct with all our papers and so forth for business -- for personal business -- and we knew what it was. And so -- and so the railroad station was about a mile from our place and we were -- we knew the train was taking us to Toulouse. Our neighbor next door had a niece who was living very close to the Spanish border in that small village and that was a village called . Okay.</p><p>O: Well, I was asking you, before you fled for the , how normal your life really was. I <span class="page-break" number="13"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 6</p><p> TAPE NUMBER 2</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, okay. So the first -- the first year of the Occupation, at first, we were -- we didn't know what was going on. So we didn't want to make any moves, we just didn't know. So I -- I attended a local schoolin__ there.</p><p>And the second year -- that was 1941, "42 -- since life was -- was more normal, I went back to a school -- not in Paris, but in , which is about 32, 35 kilometers outside of Paris, where I <span class="page-break" number="14"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 7 just the day to day, and okay, tomorrow -- and tomorrow -- we'll see tomorrow. But then when -- when the round-up started really to affect us, when friends or members of families were arrested, when the restrictions on what we could do started really to show that it's not that benign. Things are going to be very drastic. That's when -- that's when we -- we decided to take action. So some people went into the Resistance, some people tried to go into hiding, some people went to their nation of origin, trying to like -- like some of the Romanian went to the Romanian embassy and were trying to go back to Romania because -- we -- we were receiving letters from Romania. They were censored, but still they were -- they were normal letters. And they were -- we could guess from what they were telling us that life was very normal, and they were saying "Why don't you come here? Why do you stay there, you know, far away from us?" So -- but the Romanian and other nation didn't want the Jews there, see. So you could feel that the trap was -- was really -- was really closing down on you and the game was to find a hole in that trap. And everybody had a different story or a different people trying to help. And so the goal was to go into Vichy France -- unoccupied France. But at least we are not with the Germans. So -- so there were all kind of ways to get there -- illegally, I mean. And -- but they were dangerous. All of them were dangerous. And -- and some unscrupulous people were making good money by -- by telling people "I will take you over the border," and robbing them or selling them to the Germans and so forth. So -- or killing them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You knew this at the time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Yes. We knew that because we heard of families who were -- who tried to get over and we never heard of them again or -- or -- we knew they had been arrested. And SO -- SO you were supposed to go to that farm, and at the end of the field it was Vichy France and they hada waiting for you with a bicycle or stuff like that. Some -- some were legitimate, <span class="page-break" number="15"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 8 that checkpoint, whoever was the guide would give us our pass, the German would come, and they were legitimate pass in our name, and they couldn't see that they were -- they were forged. And they would stamp them and then two hours later we would be out of Occupied France. It was costly.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did -- were there other people who were travelling with you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was a large group. And I was never curious about that, but my Mother told me that after the war, she heard on the radio a -- French radio -- a program about that group. And essentially, why it was so costly, it's because what they were doing, they were a Jewish organization who was taking the children of people who had been rounded up and their children had been -- not arrested -- hidden. And they were taking them to farms and so forth in unoccupied France. And they were always with adults and they -- the adults were like their parents, and so forth. And they would do that, I believe, once a week, or once every two weeks, I don't remember exactly. But my mother told me -- but I never had the curiosity to go to the and find out. No. After -- after that -- <span class="page-break" number="16"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 9 mother saved. And so we had -- she had sugar, and she had oil, and she had coffee, and she had all kind of stuff like that. And we carried that on the train. And we spent -- we went to dinner -- to friends of ours. The wife of a friend of ours who was a prisoner of war, so she -- she was safe because of that. And then we went to___------_and took the train for Toulouse. And we were -- we -- we -- the compartments were booked in advance, not by us, but by that organization, so we -- when we got there we got our seat assignment in the train. And -- no, we got in the station -- railroad station -- there are Germans at patrol, they had French police patrolling. But they were not checking anybody. Absolutely not. During -- at least that time. Maybe some other time they would round up people or what but nobody asked us anything. We went on the train, nobody said "Do you have a pass?" or what. Absolutely not. The train -- okay. What they wanted is "Did you pay your fare to go to Toulouse?" That's what they wanted to know. So we went there.</p></p></dialogue>

And a friend of mine told me that if you dip a wooden match with a cotton tip -- like a Q-tip -- if you dip that in bleach and you go very carefully over the red, it disappear. So I took a chance and I went very carefully over -- did that -- took one of those long, wooden matches that we still had in France at the time, with the cotton, bleach, and it disappeared. So the only -- the only way they could have found that I was Jewish was if I would be arrested in circumstances where they would check on my identify. But mine was a legitimate one. You could see that it was not forged. And I was taking a chance because had they checked on me, asked that precinct there ins "What about him?" and they would have looked in their and said "Oh, .

And from both ends of the train they had German soldiers with -- officer and so forth -- checking those there. And they were talking loudly among themselves. And was very organized. And the German Army is very militaristic and traditional. And I found out that in their rules and regulation when you have a check-point, you have to ask, I believe, a major and another officer and an NCO and then you have to have a private holding a -- one of those lamps -- oil lamp. So they were -- I can see -- still see that tall German officer who was, I believe, a major or something, who must have been a hero of World War I.

And so we went to pick up my parents and we took the luggage and she said "Let me prepare lunch for you." And then she say "Well, we have to have a scenario because there is a lot of family, so you are going to be the cousin from Brittany." So we became the cousin from Brittany. And we knew the family so well and -- but they say -- "But how come we didn't see you at the wedding?" and this and that or -- "Well, we were not there." Or, you know, things during the family. So -- so then when the Germans came, a few days later, my parents had to be in hiding because she felt that it was suspicious to have the whole family. So we stayed -- my sister and I were supposed to stay with her. And my sister was still an age to go to school. But nobody was saying anything about she has to go to school. So we -- we were there and my parents were hiding and when people were coming in the house, they were moving the house and you could hear that. And finally, little by little, people started to find out, because we told them and my parents were telling them. So we told a close friend of hers -- her husband was the guide who took us over the mountain and was also the guide for Arnold, I found out. And then another friend of her was the mayor of a small city and he was getting memos from the police about the different operation. And he would tell us "Oh, they are preparing an operation against the Jews in Toulouse," and this and that. And -- and finally she went to Paris, and she had a sister whose husband was a prisoner of war. Her sister was absolutely beautiful. She was one of the most beautiful women that you can see.

So -- so it had two or three streets at the most. So one street was the main road, so to speak. No. It's a narrow road going from one small village to the other. It was the way to Spain anyway. And the other one was like a very narrow street -- I don't even know if it was paved or not -- leading to -- not even -- they didn't even have any shops there. Just farms and so forth. And they had like a general store which was just across the house where we were in hiding. And the house was close by the road. I should have taken a picture of that with me, but it doesn't matter. So -- and right across the street, they had that general store. And they were selling, you know, the tobacco, and it was like a -- the baker would come and leave bread there and so forth. And they would sell liquor, and wine, and it was like a big place, so -- when the Germans draw that line and they had patrol post every mile or so, that was the headquarter there. Right across the street from us. And the people who were the owner of that -- of that general store, their son was in the Waffen SS -- French. And they were suspicious that something was not right with us. But they knew the husband of that lady extremely well. He was a respected World War I veteran, he was the chief of the veteran organization, and so forth.

And so he had a group of four French who were -- well, two French and two Gypsies -- the Gypsies also were starting to be rounded up -- who were -- they were coming -- going from one place to the next in hiding. At night they would walk in the fields. And they would stop in a farm or they would stop in a church. A lot of local priests, country priests, were also involved in helping out people like that. It didn't matter if they were -- if people were Jews or -- a lot of also were involved with pilots, who were shot down. And so they had -- they had like a chain, you see. And those organizations were very strong. Very, very strong. They had to be very -- very -- how can I say that -- they had to choose who they were passing because they could be betrayed very easily, and many of them were betrayed.</p><p> O: Were there other refugees living in this 2 <span class="page-break" number="21"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 5</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not very much.

And my father almost died there in the mountain, of exhaustion. Because we walked 12 hours in the snow. Yes. Well, that saved us because the Germans had a -- had a -- like a small -- not chalet, but kind of portable, little -- little hut in the mountain. And the weather was so bad that -- before that -- that they had abandoned it. So we had to walk there in front of that hut and nobody was there, but the Germans could see us from the valley because we saw, before we left, we saw people walking that same mountain and -- and was covered with snow on one side.

I met a lot of characters there. That's when I met my first -- the first Indian Jew from India. I didn't know that they had Jews in India at the time -- and was a pilot and I met also a pilot of the Royal Air Force and a German crew who came -- they wanted to erase what Germany had done during the war. They came and they had their log book from World War II showing their missions and how good they were. And of course they were turned down. They were crushed.

Not at all. But Jew has to know which is his place or her place in French society.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh, yes, of course. Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Yes, because since -- since the end of the war -- see the French population before the war was about 300,000 Jews. Most of those Jews were of falling origin and first generation. And, so they were essentially -- they were not -- not merchants. All -- all -- if they were merchants they were people who were people who were working in the market place. You know, they -- they -- they were -- they were really -- their -- their social -- the -- the -- economically and -- and -- and socially the Jews that we knew were, I wouldn't say "poor," but they were really at the bottom. They were at the bottom. And after the war we had a big influx of Jews from -- from eastern Europe from North Africa and -- and the second generation or third generation of -- of the Jews born to Russian immigrants or Polish immigrants because the school system is so open went to higher education and all of a sudden they are engineers or . They are higher ranking members of that corporation, of the other <span class="page-break" number="32"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 9</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, what -- what motivated me to leave was the feeling that I didn't want to be on -- on the continent where that continent is essentially a enormous burden place for -- for -- for -- for the Jews and the Jewish culture. Over -- over the centuries they have totally destroyed our -- our -- our culture. And I -- I felt that coming to the United State it's totally different because the United States -- all the culture excepted all the cultures, blend. It's the only place in the world that I know where you go to a church which on -- on -- on -- on -- on Saturday it's a synagogue and you have several around here. It's the only place in the world where you go to a buffet for a Sunday brunch and they serve bagels and Matzo. I saw that in Pittsburgh. On Sunday I went down, Sunday brunch, bagels and lox and so forth and Matzo. And everybody knows what Matzo is. In France or England or a place -- any place like that it was unheard and heard. it's the only place that I know where on Christmas the Jews are working for the Christians, so they can stay home and celebrate. It's -- it's -- and it's the only place that I know where anti-Semitism was maybe of fervent as in France 50 years ago. And I remember World War II and I remember talking to Jewish -- Jewish Gls and what they were -- what -- what they were putting up with was absolutely similar to what we were putting up with. I saw them when I was in England before the end of the war the Jewish -- Jewish -- they had, you know, Jewish -- like a restaurant and so forth. Jewish and we were comparing notes <span class="page-break" number="32"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, if -- if -- if you -- if you mean the religion by going to synagogue, the ritually and so forth, no. No. No. No, but -- but the sense of Judaism I always had and -- and -- and -- and I make a separation, in my mind at least, because I was raised in a nontraditional -- I wouldn't say "not religious," no. My parents were religious, but they didn't follow the ritual. They -- they -- they didn't eat kosher. They didn't do this. They didn't do that. But -- but the sense that -- that -- the deep sense of -- of Judaism, we have. I feel that's -- that's much more important than -- than -- than, you know, repeating a prayer just because it's a prayer. So that's -- that's what I'm trying to -- to -- to -- to follow everyday.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What sort of long term impact do you think that all of these experiences during the war still have on you today?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That -- there is such thing as fate. That things don't happen just like coincidence. That there is fate. There is -- there is -- like gears working together and I know if -- if that didn't -- that was not the case for us I don't know how we would have been able to survive. It's a very strange feeling and that, in spite of fate, fate is not blind. You have to help yourself also. That's the most important step. That -- that -- you are responsible for what happened to you if you don't know how to read the signs around you and that you have to do. You cannot expect somebody else to do for you and I believe that's very Jewish.</p></p></dialogue>
