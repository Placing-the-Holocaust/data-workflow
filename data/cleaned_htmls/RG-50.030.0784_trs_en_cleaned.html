Those countries tr -- took advantage of Poland's production, they -- they milked Poland to death, taking advantage of everything. So, from 1920 to 1939, it wasn't even 20 years that Poland was a free country, taking care of its own. So we didn't -- we were not prepared for any kind of war.

And in the -- you were sometimes so cold that you couldn't even breathe in the cold air, because it was -- when you -- if you didn't have anything in front of your mouth, you could feel like knives, okay, cutting into your lungs. So you always had to have something in you -- in front of your face.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And your mother would work in this sort of situation?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, she did.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Here's a part I don't understand. I understand that she goes to a spring to get water in the summertime, to haul it back up, but in the winter there's all this snow outside.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, di-- di-- you had to shovel -- you have to shovel the snow wherever you could.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Would it be hot in summer?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I wouldn't say hot, but it was nice and warm, and it's -- the beauty of nature up there at that time, everything explodes. Everything grows so fast, I never seen anything grow that fast in that humid, warm air. And as a matter of fact, if it wasn't for nature, I don't know if we would have survived. As soon as it got warm, some -- a different kind of mushrooms would appear in the forest. And children -- and I was among them, we would spend at least half a day, every other day, picking mushrooms. And later on, all kinds of berries: blackberries, raspberry -- wild raspberries. And like I said before, if it wasn't for nature, I don't know if we would have survived. The problem was, we could not preserve any of it for wintertime, so we had to consume it right there. Sometime we would bring a bucketful of mushrooms, cook it and eat it for next couple meals. And that was my job, picking mushrooms, picking berries.</p></p></dialogue>

It was all run by -- by Russians, of course. And about 20 some kilometers farther, there were a couple of Russian villages, which at time, we were given permission -- we were given the pass, that we could go to those villages and trade, barter for some of the clothes that we brought with us from Poland for some food.</p></p></dialogue>

And she was a--a think when we got there, she was a hundred percent communist. She would t -- always tell how much she hated us, and for all different reasons that she would give.</p><p>But be -- by the time we were leaving camp, she was our best friend.
