It was not on the map of Europe. It was divided into three parts. Parts of Russia, parts of Germany, parts of Austria. Those countries tr -- took advantage of Poland's production, they -- they milked Poland to death, taking advantage of everything. So, from 1920 to 1939, it wasn't even 20 years that Poland was a free country, taking care of its own. So we didn't -- we were not prepared for any kind of war.

On top of it, within a couple weeks of arresting my father, Russians authorities came, lived on the edge of the town -- and like I said, we had a big house, we had a big barn, they wanted our property, because they wanted to -- for Russian people to take to live in there. My mother insisted that we will move if they give us a house to move in. And that's why we did -- we were not very surprised when on the 10" of February, 1940, again a Russian officer with a -- some soldiers, at night -- they always done all those arresting and deporting at night.

And middle of the night, we -- my grandmother and my brother and my sister, were put on this sled, horse-drawn sled and my mother, my older sister and me, we walked. We walked, and we were taken to the government building, not far from railroad station, and the building was pretty soon being filled up with a family li -- just like ours. All the people from Nowogredek, most of them women and children, because most of the men were either in jail, or -- or gone somewhere.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It-- it wasn -- part of it was beautiful, not just pretty, it was beautiful. The nature can be that way, but it -- they -- also can be cruel, because of the cold, because of the terrain and whatever.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So your -- the -- the -- settlement that you go to is Rzhavka(ph), yeah?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So it's a rather small place --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It's not a cabin, it's a big building.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, big buildings, okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Big building, well, I would say the length of my -- this, my house, and there be anywhere 30 to 40 people in each building.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So it was like a barracks?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was a barrack, yes. And in -- each side had a couple windows in it, and a big stove, and brick stove for heat, and for you -- there was some cooking you could cook up there, but it was a big stove.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So di-- were -- was everybody responsible for their own food, their own cooking at this place?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, there was -- we didn't have t -- anything to cook, first of all.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So we were rely -- we had to rely on what was in the camp. There was a bakery, and there was a, what they called restaurant, where, if you had money, and you had a coupon, you could buy some soup, and of course, you could buy your allowance  <span class="page-break" number="69"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Adam Szymel (r) January 25, 2015 of bread. Everybody, every person, child and old people were assigned 200 grams of bread, black bread, which amounted sometime to a couple of slices. We were assigned that much a day, and we could buy it. That -- no more, no less, but that was what we could buy.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, in other words, you weren't given food.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, we had to buy it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And in the beginning, how did you buy it, if you had no money?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, we had some money with us.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We brought some money because at that time in -- in Nowogredek, the -- the currency already was Russian dru -- ruble.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay, let me go back for that, I didn't think of this before. Your family had been well-to-do, and when the Soviets took over, then they nationalized and took away your businesses. But wer -- were you given any compensation?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, no, I don't know, but my mother would get paid --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I see.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- for her work.</p></p></dialogue>

We, among other things we had a beautiful horse. And the young man that worked for us, and he still lived with us when Russians came in, told my mother that he heard, among men, that they were goin -- the Russians were going to take our horse away.</p><p>But he suggested that he -- he even had the person that was willing to buy our horse, somebody connected to the Russians, that he would buy our horse. And my mother sold that horse, and she got quite a bit of money for it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And she took that one you left.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And sh -- and it turned out, that was the money that saved us in Russia.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: That's an interesting point. I wanted to -- to get a sense of when you had --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes, we --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- when you took clothes and no food, then you were in a -- in --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- yeah, I-- I-- w-we never seen the money, my mother never showed it to us. But I know that for a fact, that she sold the horse, and I didn't know how much she got.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>Of course, I got to know it later, when we were outside Russia.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm. So when you first got there, she had a way of being able to buy food for you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, it was -- you know, whatever was assigned to us. And of course, she got -- she was one of the first that she got a job. Her job was to bring water from the river,  <span class="page-break" number="71"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Adam Szymel * January 25, 2015 that was farther on, not wer -- next to our camp, there was a area about a couple kilometers from there, where there was a spring. And she would bring clear water.</p><p>Sh -- what she would have to do is fill the wooden barrels, which were on this wood --on this horse-drawn sled. She would have to go to the -- chop the ice, fill ti-- with the bucket, walk up and fill up the barrels, and then take it to the bakery, take the water there. Again, dip the water out of the barrels and take it to the barrels inside the bakery. She would do that all day long. It wou -- believe me, I helped her sometime, it was a back blake -- breaking job. And especially, she used to wear a sack in front of her as a apron. From splashing water and freezing, she sounded like she was a-- she was armor, th-the -- the ice so --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: It would freeze, huh?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- freeze, it would freeze. She -- but she never gave up, she worked, because she had six mouths to feed.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, yeah. Your grandmother too.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, that's right. Well, all of us, were si-six of us.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So, she worked very hard.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was your sister put to work?</p></p></dialogue>

At least she didn't have to work in -- because the -- all the other -- and the other industry was logging.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And eventually my mother worked there too. What the de -- women would do, when the men felled the trees, the women would chop the branches, and clear the snow so the -- the horse-drawn drivers would haul the logs up to main drag, and then big, huge sleds, pulled by the tractors, would dr-draw -- would draw those logs to the river, which again in the spring would be floated to the destination whate -- whatever it was.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I want to go back to one point, just to make it clear, and it's about the food. That is, you were able to buy food for yourselves if you had the money, but not as much as you wanted to.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Only one bre -- specially the bread, that was assigned to you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So in other words, it was rationed, but it wasn't handed out.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Exactly.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It was rationed in the sense that you could only get a certain portion.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: That's right.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="73"></span>  77 Interview with Adam Szymel January 25, 2015</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And you had to pay for it.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. And that was with all food?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Exactly.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: The -- the only thing is, all the time we were there, we never had any -- even the smallest amount of sugar. The -- n-no butter, no meat. I nev --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So what did you have, what did you eat?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Bread.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Moi--- mainly bread. Sometime later, in -- when we were already a couple years in Russia, in there -- well, maybe a year, they allowed f-- us to receive parcels from Poland. And sometime -- my grandmother, sometime some friends -- as a matter of fact, we received a package of food from one of the Jews of Nowogredek that owed my father some money. And he -- he looked into it and found our address where we were at, and send us lifesaving food that we're -- I'm still grateful for it. So, like I said before, there were Jews, and there were Jews.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Just like there are Poles and there are Poles.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="74"></span> Interview with Adam Szymel " January 25, 2015</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Thank you for that. Thank you for sharing that. Oh, do you remember what it was that was in that package?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think it -- most of it was pork belly, which is, to us, was -- God, it was --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: There's a lot you can do with pork belly.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Exactly. Especially when you're starving, a little bit of fat --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- is -- it's a treasure.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. So, did anyone get sick here?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Lot of people. Within a, I would say six months of being in that camp, we started losing some infants, some babies. There was no -- women didn't have enough milk to feed the babies, there was no milk to be had. The babies were starving, they were dying. Pretty soon, about a kilometer behind our camp, on a little hill, started appear wood crosses. And after children, little children, the older people started dying.</p><p>Within a year, we must have lost oh, at least 50 people, older people. Our camp consisted of people from two different parts of Poland. Half of us were from Nowogredek, and half were from the southern part of where -- what was -- what is now Ukraine, close to the Lwew. So there were people from two -- two different parts of Poland.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In -- how large was the camp, population-wise.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, that's a lot.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Quite a few. There were, as far as Russians, there was one man, commander -- commandant, we called him commandant. And there was one KGB man, and one bakers with his family. And there was one Russian 1-in th-- a woman, which wer -- she was in charge of the restaurant.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's an important position.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Very important. The rest of it was Polish people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And -- how -- what was their manner towards you, how did they behave towards you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, of course, the -- the commandant wasn't bad man, but the -- but the KGB, he was typical communist. To him, the only thing that mattered was his party, his nation, and he tried to convince us that we should be grateful that we wound up in Russia. Within about six months, they opened a school, wi-with one teacher, Russian, of course. And everybody, all the children, until 16 years, they had to go to school. And of course, we didn't mind subjects like math and are -- physics, chemistry, or whatever. But of course they also tried to convince us again of the advantages of communist system, which didn't work with us at all.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So how did it -- did children just stay silent when this sort of --  <span class="page-break" number="76"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Adam Szymel .deg January 25, 2015</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, we -- we learn how to go along with them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Just to get a ga -- got along them. They -- I--I was already twel -- like I said, I was 12 years old, and what happened to me once, sometime we would sit on the bench, couple of our boys, and we sing our Polish national songs. And they through -- we were trying to get our teacher mad. And one day he called me in and he told me if I keep it up, nothing may happen to me, but my mother wi-- may wind up in -- in jail. So of course, we stopped doing that, too.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: What kind of interaction was there with the KGB men? Like what -- what was his -- what was his function? How did he -- how did he -- what was his role in your life? Did he come and just talk to people, or did he --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, he wanted -- he wanted to make sure we were afraid of him.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So how did he ensure that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, his manner, first of all, his manner. He would march into to the room, told the kids, sit down. You know, his voice, his manner, and h-he would really rough kind of a talk, let us know that he was in a cha -- in charge, he was the boss.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was there informing going on?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Very -- if there was, it must have been very little, because we were -- pe-people were very, very well in touch with another. If there was, I never heard of any.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="77"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Adam Szymel ia January 25, 2015</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay. So it wasn't the same sort of situation as even back home, where people started being afraid of what they would say in -- in public.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, in the camp -- in the camp, wa-wa-wa -- it was w-w-wa -- solidarity was a main thing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And, where did these officials live? How did they live?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They had their own quarters. There was special barrack. In this special barrack they -- the baker has his couple rooms in there, next to the bakery, and so the -- the woman that's in charge of restaurant, and the KGB and -- and the commander was -- they had th-their own -- their own building.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you said the commandant was not such a bad guy.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, he -- he -- he was authority, but he didn't over -- didn't abuse it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He -- maybe he felt sorry for us, of anything.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. And so it was mostly what he didn't do, rather than what he did.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Exactly, exactly.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm. So, you -- it took half a year for you to be in school after you arrived, so what did you do in that half year?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Absolutely nothing. In the winter, there wasn't much you could do really, because eventually there were either four or five feet of  <span class="page-break" number="78"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Adam Szymel * January 25, 2015 snow sometime. And in the -- you were sometimes so cold that you couldn't even breathe in the cold air, because it was -- when you -- if you didn't have anything in front of your mouth, you could feel like knives, okay, cutting into your lungs. So you always had to have something in you -- in front of your face.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And your mother would work in this sort of situation?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, she did. Unless it got to be about -- below 40 degrees, then nobody worked.</p><p>But if it was warmer than that, then everybody had to go work, and men w-worked falling trees, and women doing the rest of it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Here's a part I don't understand. I understand that she goes to a spring to get water in the summertime, to haul it back up, but in the winter there's all this snow outside.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, di-- di-- you had to shovel -- you have to shovel the snow wherever you could. Sometime it was like a tunnel between the -- on the each side there be about five feet of snow, and you just go. And the roads, with the passing of the sleds, eventually, you know, it was a track that you could go by.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And of course, the snow lasted about Ma-May -- May sometime, middle of May, before the snows would start to melt.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's a long time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="79"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Adam Szymel * January 25, 2015</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's a long time. By June, it wer -- snow was gone and then summer right away would start.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Would it be hot in summer?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I wouldn't say hot, but it was nice and warm, and it's -- the beauty of nature up there at that time, everything explodes. Everything grows so fast, I never seen anything grow that fast in that humid, warm air. And as a matter of fact, if it wasn't for nature, I don't know if we would have survived. As soon as it got warm, some -- a different kind of mushrooms would appear in the forest. And children -- and I was among them, we would spend at least half a day, every other day, picking mushrooms. And later on, all kinds of berries: blackberries, raspberry -- wild raspberries. And like I said before, if it wasn't for nature, I don't know if we would have survived. The problem was, we could not preserve any of it for wintertime, so we had to consume it right there. Sometime we would bring a bucketful of mushrooms, cook it and eat it for next couple meals. And that was my job, picking mushrooms, picking berries.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Had you done that at home?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Mushrooms, yes, and berries of course, too. But I do -- I done it for different reasons.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: For pleasure.</p></p></dialogue>

Here, it was to survive.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. And that was the summertime.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Summer --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So the -- so there was no -- like a fence around this settlement. You were allowed to go into --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We were allowed, but there were hundreds and hundreds of kilometers of nothing but virgin forest. And we were not in touch with any -- eight kilometer from our camp was the -- what Russians call was baza, which is like a center, gog -- government's center, where they control all the activities in the neighborhood, for -- where were -- they just decided where the logging would be. It was all run by -- by Russians, of course. And about 20 some kilometers farther, there were a couple of Russian villages, which at time, we were given permission -- we were given the pass, that we could go to those villages and trade, barter for some of the clothes that we brought with us from Poland for some food.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And did you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yes, I would go with my mother and carry a sack, maybe oh, 20 -- 20 some pounds of flour, or some -- some wa -- whatever else we could. That helped, of course, sur -- to survive.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But other than that, you didn't have any contact with any local people.</p></p></dialogue>

She was about 18 years old. She was a mail girl, she used to bring our mail from the baza to our camp, and she would carry that, pass it on to every barrack. And she was a--a think when we got there, she was a hundred percent communist. She would t -- always tell how much she hated us, and for all different reasons that she would give.</p><p>But be -- by the time we were leaving camp, she was our best friend.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- plant. It just happened, this is a story in itself. Second summer, my mother and I, we went to the village, which is located about 28 kilometers, to trade, I think it was my father's jacket or something, for some 60 or 80 pounds of potatoes. The problem was that we'd had no means of bringing those potatoes to the camp. So we told the Russians people to keep it for us, and we will come back for it in the winter.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="93"></span> ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion</p><p> Interview with Adam Szymel " January 25, 2015</p><p> It just again happened that my mother was sick.

We had a family get together, and decided that we have t -- my brother, who was that time just eight years old -- no, I'm sorry, he was practically nine already. No, he was eight years old. And I was practically 13 -- no, I was 13 years old. So, that were two of us, right in the middle of winter, we have to go and get those potatoes.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: |, previous summer, I work -- I made a sled, I built a s -- myself a sled. We were gonna use that sled to bring those potatoes.

I still remember the smell of the sweat, bodies, and the cigars, or smo -- I mean, s -- pipes and smoking. We slept all on the grou -- on the floor.

So we put our bag of potatoes on the sled, covered it with the blanket and some straw. My son -- my  <span class="page-break" number="95"></span>  Interview with Adam Szymel " January 25, 2015 brother would sit on it, and the -- the sled was full of about five feet high with hay for the horses that would be fed on the -- in our camp. And the two women climbed on the top of that sled hay, and I would lead it. We were about the last ones of the whole caravan of those sleds. E-Everything was fine, until we got to about the middle of the distance to our camp. There was a steep hill, downwards went the road, and on the bottom there was a stream, which of course was frozen solid now.</p><p>And there the pass -- the road turned left. Well, we were coming down th-the sleds that went ahead of us, cleaned the road pretty well, so when we were coming, it was pretty slick going.

Now, it was due south wi -- by this time the German armies were already approaching Moscow, so there was no way we could go straight south. A lot of people were hesitating, didn't want to leave the camp because after all, there was some security here, and if we leave camp, who -- then what? My mother was a different -- of different opinion. She says she won't stay here any more, we have to leave. And sure enough, we -- my sister went to a -- the village, which was about 20 some mi -- kilometers to, from -- from our camp, and next thing we know, she came back couple days later with the horse-drawn sled, with the farmer, and that we can leave the camp --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: With him?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- and he will take us to the -- that village, and from there there was only few kilometers to the railroad station -- railroad that was being built.

Again, my mother bribed some of the people over there with some tobacco. And they told us that we can load in, into the -- get into one of the freight cars that was bringing supplies, railroad supplies, and we traveled about three days. They closed the doors completely because they didn't want anybody know what we -- we were in the car.</p><p>It was freezing.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The worst -- the worst was when somebody got lost from the train, we never -- we never found them.

What would happen, we would get to the station, and people, some people from each car would run to the center of the town to see if they could buy, steal or whatever some food. And sometime when they were there, the train would go -- would start going, and leave them behind. And like I said, most of the time, when train would leave those people, we never seen them again.</p></p></dialogue>

There was enough water for drinking, never mind washing or -- or -- our clothes or washing yourself. Can you imagine the stink? Forty people in the car. We were in one of the towns, I don't remember the name now, big town. And all of a sudden, all through the train went the news that on a different siding, there's a train just like ours, and in that train, there's a priest that's gonna say a mass. Believe me, everybody, whoever could stand on their feet,  <span class="page-break" number="104"></span>  108 Interview with Adam Szymel January 25, 2015 we run to that siding, and sure enough, there was in one of the cars, the gate -- door was open, there was a table, and a young priest was saying a mass. He was in a shreds of clothes just like we were. Dirty, filthy, but you could tell he was a God's man. We were kneeling on the snow, we were praying. We were singing Polish songs. At the end of it we usually sing a song which says, God, let us -- give us -- give us a chance to get to freedom, get to pola -- get back to Poland, to our cri-- our country.</p></p></dialogue>
