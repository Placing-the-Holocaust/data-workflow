<body><dialogue class=""><p>GERTA BLACHMAN WILCHFORT July 3, 1989</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Would you tell me your name please and when you were born?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: My full name today is Gerta Wilchfort. I was born on the 24th of April in 1923 in Breslau. Breslau is in today and... <span class="page-break" number="0"></span> clothes and a uh certain distance and we had to jump from a ten meter board and had to run and all these things. And when you passed it I got a little, I got a certificate signed by Hitler that I passed that thing, so it wasn't you know, and the Catholic school, the the uh principal was a lady and she was very much for us and helped us overcome these things.</p><p>But after a couple of years or so she called me into the office or called my parents and said they are no longer able to keep us in the Catholic school. I either have to leave the school altogether or go to a Jewish school. So luckily we had in Breslau a very good Jewish gymnasium. We had actually two Jewish schools and this gymnasium was accredited like any other school like here the Jewish Hebrew Academy that is accredited now. And II knew a little bit of Hebrew but I was always very ambitious so I, I had, I took tutoring to get better in Hebrew so I could be up to par with the other kids who had started there. We had a lot of Hebrew, a lot of but all the other subjects I started where my English we had a very good English teacher and he was a stickler for uh grammatic and we learned very well the irregular verbs and all those things so we had a very good schooling there. That was only two years I think you know but it was very intensive and very good. And uh I was a member of the Zionist youth movement there</p><p> which, I don't know and uh we had meetings and we had outings but I <span class="page-break" number="1"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Fif... I was born in "23 so fifteen, fifteen, sixteen. And us that was clear across Germany near Munich. From Breslau to Munich was quite a ... and uh I went back in September and in early November uh they had this uh in Paris on this on this ambassador <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> was to go to Shanghai and uh my parents didn't want to go to Shanghai. So they managed, we had a cousin in Cuba and after many weeks of communications, we, she sent us a so called visa to go to Cuba and my parents purchased us seat (ph) uh the the cabin space on the Havana (ph) American line, on the St. Louis, and we were supposed to leave on I think was the 13th of May. Now to be on the personal side, on the 24th of April I had my sixteenth birthday. And my parents thought well you know, I had such terrible youth, at least she wants to make me a little party and I had a friend and he said uh can I bring another friend of mine. And my mother said yes, and I had some very good girl friends that uh my parents are friends with their parents from way back from World War | already, and so we had a little party, and he brought this boy. And he had come from so and that's how I met him. That was my future husband. (PAUSE) So a couple of days later these friends, these, they were two sisters and their parents left for Shanghai. And uh this young man Marcos (ph) said we'll go together to the station to say goodbye to them, and I met him again and he gave me, had given me a book so I went up and I met his mother. I went up to his apartment and I went and met his mother for the only time. And he told me that uh he wants to leave but his parents are quite old already and his father got quite beaten in this smaller town in during the Kristallnacht and he won't be able to go anywhere. So his mother wrote, he was also an only child, his mother will bring him to to the Belgian border and he will try to <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> and be killed there. But my other grandparents couldn't do that because they, first of all they were quite religious and they wouldn't commit suicide and uh they lived for each other. They thought they're going to help each other and maybe but and but they both died. I never heard from them. They never came out after the war. But my Grandmother Blachman, my , she was quite a lady and she always had her hair done so she had <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> tomorrow. So we stayed another night. It was very hot and very sticky and I think we slept that night up on the on deck because it was already unbearably hot and you know, coming from Europe and we are not used to this climate and uh next day, the next day there were all kinds of little boats came from Havana with family. There were lots of families that were uh split up. There were some men that had come out of some German concentration camps that had gone out first and the women and the children had come later when there weren't any places on boats or they had small business to attend to or some reason lots of families were split up. This one family, Matulski (ph), and that uh we befriended on the boat this lady was alone on this boat with three children and her husband was in Cuba already. And the cousin that sent us the uh our visa was of course in Cuba and she came and so a lot of people, relatives and friends came and hired little boats and there's a picture of that in that in the book if you want...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, let's see your pictures. Let's see yours.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My pictures. OK. This is a picture of me with uh with this friend that I was talking about.</p><p>(OK) And this is a picture on the way to Havana where there was a party on boat uh on board. We had parties at night and this was . . . I think these, this picture is of my parents from Breslau yet, from, from before we left. My father was a very good looking man.</p><p>(Yes indeed) Yes. So I think it was interesting to see this, this picture of this of these little boats that this was the St. Louis its... itself the dining room was a beautiful dining room and came down the spiral staircase. I felt very glamorous.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: We can get, we'll get other pictures.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh here's the little picture. Here's the picture where the where the relatives came. You see it? And they sent up pineapples and they sent up all kinds of things and there was yelling up and down the you know and we were standing very close on the on the railing and it was you know hard to find the people that there was almost a thousand people on the boat, on the ship. So anyhow it became clearer and clearer that we're not going to land. I mean you don't want to hear this. . .</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, do. Talk about that. Yes I do.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I mean the, the background of it was...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, the background we don't need but your how did it become clear to you that you weren't going to land? How did you know?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because of the time element. You know, we were in Cuba almost a week. We were sitting there in the harbor and we just gave up hope you know that the negotiations will come to an end anduh...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did Captain Shroeder (ph) come and talk to you at all? <span class="page-break" number="2"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, there wasa____ Committee. There were lots of uh prominent people on board, you know Jewish lawyers and uh teachers and people like that. They formed a Committee and they were the in, the in between the people, the passengers and the uh captain and they sent telegrams to Roosevelt and to all over the world and they tried to get you know to get us going but didn't. So I think also the people that came in these little boats uh let us know that it looked pretty bad in Havana itself. And there was some few people, I think twelve people, that had, that were not refugees so to speak, that had regular visas and uh they got off the boat so we knew you know more or less we knew at the end that we're not going to stay. So one good day we just pulled out you know the anc... pulled up the anchor and we left and this is the picture here of this cousin she's standing there. Havana, June "39. She standing at the and crying and in the back you see the St. Louis <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> the list, the passenger list and they divided the passengers to wherever they wanted. Of course England was already then the preferred country because we knew it was away from Europe you know a little bit and that we had a feeling that would have been the safest, but not everybody could go to England. But my friend, this friend went to England and I never heard from him again. I don't know what happened to him. But we went uh to Belgium. Maybe my mother told them that she had a brother there. I don't know how we came to Belgium, but I ran back to the cabin and my parents were already packing again and uh we debarked in Antwerp. We got off, one of the first ones and then the Paris Match came, the uh newspaper people came and took pictures. Do you want me to show you? (Sure) And uh we were all standing up on, on deck and waiting a man saved his dog, he had to have his dog, and my parents happened to be here they're here. This is my mother and my father. They were standing there, but I was not there. I had been running around. So this was in the Paris Match, and uh you know, was a big story, newspaper story at the time in Europe that this first boat and the people coming. So they put us on a train right away to Brussels and we stayed a couple of nights in a hotel and we were free.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You had papers?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, they made us sign papers that we were not to work and that we were accepted as refugees but that as soon as the situation will allow us to leave the country, we will leave, we will leave. And we signed to that my parents, we signed to that. And forgot all about it but when the war was over, you know, we had to uh report every six months to the police and they presented us with this signature and with this promise. They hadn't forgotten it. It was just filed away through the war and uh that was one reason why we left again. They didn't pressure us actually but every six months we were presented with this again. (Oh, I see.) After the war. (After the war.) Yes. But we had signed that, we signed anything we didn't even read we were so glad that we were on uh soil and that we were not in Germany and that somebody was going to take care of us more or less. So here we were in Brussels and after, to go back to my private story again, I we walked down the boulevard and I stayed and I looked in the windows and I come and there's the young man and he didn't say anything and I didn't say anything. And I came home to mother and I said, you know, I think I saw Marcos, this young man that came to <span class="page-break" number="3"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, we had a very limited budget from the United Jewish Appeal to say the least. And my parents, all we could afford they brought us, this lady brought us to find so called apartments. Well, we were, we had then one big room and a kitchen and the bathroom on the floor that was used by the people on this floor and the people on the other floor and it was not a bathroom either. It was just a toilet and a sink. And we had to have the water from there. There was no running water in this so-called apartment. So my parents let in this one woman on this couch that had to be made up every night and I slept on a cot, the cot in the kitchen, so my mother was very anxious for me to get out of this environment and even though we were not supposed to work, she found me a little job as a children's maid in a very nice high rise apartment where I had my own room and had normal conditions. And I had charge of a little boy that was four years old, three or four years old. And it was away from them but you know, it was better for me. And uh so by uh I was there the whole winter, the whole winter until the 10th of May. I woke up and I heard the noises and there were bombs coming. And I was way up in the you know, in the little room on the top of the tilted roof so I was pretty high up and I heard the I heard the bombs. I went back to my, to the people in this apartment and I said what's happening, what's happening. The Germans attacked Belgium. So the husband was also German-born. They were Jewish. She came from Luxembourg but he was also German- born. But they, you know we were just there a few months and we lived there. We didn't know much what was going on but he knew somebody told him maybe from the police or something that they're going to arrest all the German men. The German Jews or non-Jews but because of the first column of spies. They were afraid of spies so they had orders to arrest all German men and he went to bed. He said he's sick. And he said go and call your parents and tell your father to do the same. And I don't remember anymore that they didn't have a phone I just see myself running through the streets to a for a drugstore for a telephone which was quite far and calling my parents and telling them the same, to do the same. And they wouldn't believe me. They said ah stories are . .. you know. We weren't use to doing things like that. Everything had to be on the up and up. So he didn't do it and two days later they made arrangements. They got into a taxi and they sent me home and...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Who got...who they?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: This this couple with the little boy. (OK) You know she came from Luxembourg and they went to Luxembourg, or they went away. I mean they saved themselves. I saw them again after the war. They passed, they spent the war in ville. I don't know exactly how they got there but they left everything standing there and they got into a car. I think they had their own car. And they said we can't take you. You go home to your parents. So I see, I remembered going home I think even by taxi because I think by that time the trolley cars weren't even running anymore. And I come home and my mother is there and they had already taken my father. So I never saw my father anymore. They had taken him in the uh to the to you know, where the soldiers live. (A garrison?) A garrison, yes, and they had all these people, all these men assembled there and my friend <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> 0 walking. He didn't have a toothbrush. He didn't have a shirt. He didn't have anything.</p><p>They took him off the street. My father they let pack at least a little, you know. They took him off the street and he was with my father and all the other Germans in the garrison.</p><p>Anduh...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did you and your mother handle that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, we tried, you know we packed up things and we packed up things and we took it there. We couldn't get in and then they said, the next day they said they going to be transported to south of France and the train leaves on so and so, so we went early in the morning and we saw them marching through the streets. We saw them going to the train. And that was it. So I really wanted they said they're going to take them to south of France away from the war. Well the war accelerated but communication was so bad we didn't know in Brussels that they had attacked line and they to take France. <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> 1 the ocean. You know, never seen the beach like that on the ocean and it was in evening and I really remember that that was such an incredible sight, and you know, the peacefulness and in the midst of all this uh turmoil and war and running and then there was the ocean, untouched and beach and the sunset and this is something I have never forgotten in all these years. So we tried. We found a place to stay. I was almost a woman.</p><p>I was you know and the two ladies and the two children and uh they said the French border is closed. No body can go across the border. But we couldn't go back either. We couldn't go back and we couldn't go forward, so we stayed in this little hotel room and waited. Then one day they said, tomorrow they're going to open the border. You can go.</p><p>So from there to the border was still a ways to walk, but we walked. That was the only, the only way to go. There was no transportation and there were no buses or anything so if you can picture this, there were hundreds, maybe thousands of people walking to the border and they thought across the border will be safe. It's France. So here comes the famous story of my mother's silver fox. We come to the, to the border and you know, we didn't have much luggage. We didn't have anything, you know, but she wanted the silver fox and she had it like just a stole like so when we came to the border and we showed our German papers, he said, oh no, you can't go through here with German papers. You go back. You can't, we won't let you in. So as the and then the people were pushing from the back and there was a young boy with a bicycle and somehow that wonderful silver fox got tangled up in the uh in the wheels of that bicycle and my mother ran after him.</p><p> 5 . , and you know things have sometimes <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> 2 maybe not even a night when the Germans came there too. And they wanted to make the headquarters there, so the headquarters then we had to leave regardless of who we were, but they didn't want any civilians there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But they didn't stop you because you were Jewish?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, no. They didn't even know that we were Jewish. They didn't know. But uh they had, she had a little house on the premises for the uh servants before, and she said you go and stay there. So we stayed there, and, but there was nothing to eat and we were five people and there was nothing to eat. The little girl went to, into the stable and the chicken coops and she got some eggs but you know it was so much, so my mother said I don't think, they, they are very delirious now with their victory. They walked all over Europe you know. They're not going to do anything horrible and besides I don't want to hide that I'm Jewish. I think we should go and tell them, the Germans. You know, they were officers in this headquarters for the whole region. And so she went and she didn't actually say Jewish. She said we are German refugees she just said and let them figure out what they want to figure out. And we asked, we are two children, three children and we have nothing to eat. Later on maybe you can do something. And they were very polite and very nice and they sent us bread and they sent us all kinds, you know whatever they had rations. And so we stayed there a few days and uh then there were some soldiers that uh</p><p> TECHNICAL CONVERSATION and uh there was one from Hamburg who was actually a Communist you know from <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> 3</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: OK. Thank you. Let's let them change tapes.</p><p>End of Tape #1 <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> 4 Tape #2</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: OK. Let's pick up you are leaving the chateau. You've been there for a week now, and you are leaving with this wheelbarrow and a bicycle? OK.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The five of us.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The five of you. What happened?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, we made it into the next town and there were signs all over for the refugees, you know, we can go to the next, to the school. And we stayed at the school. They have cots or I don't remember any more. But we stayed in the school for a few days and uh they fed us there more or less and we never, there was already an organization in place to take care of more or less of the refugees, but uh then we figured we have to do something on our own so I went to the headquarters again and we were already emboldened by this first experience, so we went, I went to the headquarters there and I asked for transportation back to Brussels.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: OK. Now which headquarters are you talking about?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The Germans. (The Germans?) Oh yes, was all Germans. And uh they put us on the uh, they said yes, go down to the plaza. There were lots of trucks and of these trucks are going to , to to a town near, in Belgium already but near Brussels and they will take you. So, cause you know, sixteen year old girl they all wanted to have in, during the war, they wanted me to sit in front with one and the other, my mother and the other and the Matulskis were in the back of another truck, but we were all together. I wouldn't leave them. You know, I said we have five people and we go together. So we got into</p><p> and uh we stayed overnight with a with a Belgium family. They put us up but we didn't, we were really you know as Germans. They hated the Germans and we <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> 5 dressmaking, you know. To order. People came and brought their fabrics and so I really learned it there, learned a lot from them to do to do fine sewing and to do fittings and to do that's really where I got my first apprenticeship so to speak, with those two ladies.</p><p>And uh my mother was able to make a little bit money and we didn't need very much and we finally got our uh the lift, this this box with things from Germany we got them out and uh out of the uh out of the they had been in the warehouse all the time (in storage?) In storage, yes...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was in the box? What did you have?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: There was a very ingenious way of packing. They had made to order boxes like like uh closets and you know, on the one side were some clothes and then there were shelves on the shelves and then, they were sometimes as big as a small room but it was all one great box. So I don't remember any more exactly but I think my mother had uh uh table service that she was able, that we were able to sell and some crystal. No silver. No silver. No gold. That had to be brought to Hitler you know we had to, they allowed us two uh table settings silver a person, one for milk and one for supposedly. And uh, but <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> 6 about us, they you know, that _ I'm not going to register. And this other lady, this Mrs. Matulski, said no, we have we have to, they're going to send us to work you know.</p><p>We cannot do against it. Too dangerous. And she did register, but we never did. So time wore on and it got a little bit worse and worse. All of a sudden it started with people catching people on the streets or deportations. And they, on the street they took anybody that had this, you know. They went on trolley cars. They went in the front and in the back of trolley cars, the SS, and nobody could escape and they went through all the people and we had, we had identification papers, Jews. But from the lists that been registered they went from house to house and you know, they had the addresses. They had the people. It was very easy. They went and picked them up. So they sent them letters that they have to report, and it said for work only for labor. But my mother got around and they started to get rumors to rumors already that specially girls that they put girls in whore houses, that they used the Jewish girls for the soldiers and that's all she had to hear. So she wasn't going to let us down. We weren't going to go to any forced labor and we didn't. But then one day this lady got the letter. She has to report then and then for labor. It always said for labor. So uh she came, the boy came running to us. Mrs.</p><p>Blochman, my mother wants go to labor camp and please help us. I don't want to go and so my mother went over there and she said start packing. They lived with a family that had a grocery store downstairs and she had sent the girl away in the country with, to the family of these people they became pretty well friendly with them. And you and will go away like here is punctual and you can go under <span class="page-break" number="11"></span> 7 the meantime in France had started the deportations already. And the people like my father and, they were in this French camp. had come and the <span class="page-break" number="11"></span> 8 they, but we got through that. So we got the little hotel room and we stayed overnight and then when they, I think next morning, we went for breakfast into like a cafe, you know, this little French town, and we were all sitting around and here comes, in a round, ina round table with the children, and here comes the SS, comes in and looks because we weren't the only ones. I mean that the way to Switzerland and we weren't the only ones going to Switzerland. And they were trying uh to catch as many as possible but they didn't want to make uh very big thing out of it so they just went, came into the cafe and looked and looked and our hearts stood still. It was like you know, like you're frozen in time. You know, we don't and then he looked at each other and he said no, I don't think there are any here. And they left you know. And you die a little bit at a time. So that was really the closest we came with the Germans. And then this young man told us uh we're coming very close to the Swiss border now and they are even more vigilant and more uh you know, so he won't go. He doesn't want to jeopardize the this underground. You know, they don't want him to, and we are on our own now. But we should look in this village there on the French uh Swiss border, we should look around and ask for a guy named Gerard (ph) and Gerard will take us over the border. He knows we are coming and he will take us over. Well, we got off the train didn't go to this village. We got off before and we were afraid to go all on the same bus so we sent this lady with the smaller children on the bus and mother and I were walking. And we were walking on the highway with our little attache case and two women it looked kind of in in city clothes after all, and we looked a little bit conspicuous I guess. So the French gendarme stopped us. And he really questioned us. Questioned our papers and he heard as a Frenchman more than the Germans that our French wasn't up to par and we said well, we are from</p><p> and we always spoke German but well, it was a long story and but finally my mother said, look, uh you hate the Germans don't you. And he said yes, I hate the Germans. I said more than you hate the Jews. Yes. So, she said, what do you want from us. Let us take our chances. You know, she didn't tell we're Jews, we're not Jews. So he says OK. I'll, he let us go. So we went to this village. We came to this village and we couldn't locate Gerard. And wherever we asked for Gerard they just froze. The people froze up. So we stayed one night and there was a lot of German soldiers in this village and we were very scared. So we said, well, we have to get out of here because here they will catch us. So here we started walking again, and we walked up the highway and we came up to a little country inn. So we got in there and we asked for two rooms for the two families and there we were. And I think that people knew who we were. You know in German we have a saying when you die and you don't leave any money for the funeral, he says we're going to smell him out. You know, it's going to smell. They're going to have to bury us with a . So we're going to sit here until we smell, till <span class="page-break" number="12"></span> 9 They gave us uh old aprons like this farm women are wearing and they hid, they put us on the hay wagon and the, the children, they were hiding in the hay and they gave us milk cans. You know there were milk canson _ like we were farmers" women that were going on the, coming home from uh milking cows or something. And they hiding our little bit of luggage under the hay and they took us back; the highway that was the way was back to the village. Oh, I forgot to tell, I went back one day with this young man, with this with this boy, to the village to ask again for Gerard, and I found out that he had been arrested. That's why everybody was so afraid to even mention his name. So we went back, they had to go back to this village in order to get to the border. And the letter carrier, they went around the dinner hour when the German border patrol was having dinner and they knew exactly by observation what time, but still, to make sure, the letter carrier on his bicycle went right in front of us, ahead of us to make sure that we don't run into any patrols or anything. So he went ahead and we came on that hay wagon and they brought us to the farm right on the border and we got out and we got, each got a glass of milk yet and that was the farm was like a hundred years ago and | can still see it and they said well, that's as far as we can go. You go down here in the back of us is like a ravine and there's a little brook. We go over the brook but there is barbed wire. You have to go through this barbed wire or over or under or whatever, and on the other side is Switzerland. Good luck. So that little girl had a pacifier and we, we went down this ravine and we went over the brook and we went up the other side and that little girl lost her pacifier and started screaming bloody murder, but we still made it and we came over the border and uh but the Swiss border guard had heard her all the way across and he came and he helped us and you know, and we were kind of happy, but my mother said let's go, let's go little bit further in. They can still send us back, and you know, we'll celebrate later. So we got but he was good. In the meantime in the beginning of the deportations, the Swiss didn't let anybody in. And they turned back a lot of people. But in the meantime, we came a little bit later already, the public opinion had forced them to take them in, especially women and children and we had no man with us, so he wasn't going to turn us back anyhow. So he took us, I don't think to another hotel by the way. He took us to a little, to, to a town where there was a bigger uh police headquarters and uh we stayed overnight and we had he stayed with us and he even watched us when we went to the bathroom. He stood in front of the bathroom. I mean he didn't let us get out of sight and uh my mother said by the way, we're not free. They watch us. They treat us nicely but we're not going to stay. So we tried to call our relatives in Zurich but we couldn't uh commu.., there was no communication. I don't remember any more. We couldn't tell them that we were in Switzerland. So uh we told them of course right way that these papers are false, and we gave them our right papers, our right names. We had no papers to the effect but we gave them our right names and and everything and they were OK. I <span class="page-break" number="12"></span> 0 to the I don't remember anymore but they uh we spoke enough French to know that the prison is a prison is a prison, but it was a different word it was different they said a different word that we didn't understand. Well, we understood pretty soon, pretty quick.</p><p>We came to this prison that must have been five hundred years old. The keys were this big. They had you know, thick walls and thick and they, right away they separated this lady from her family. They took the son. He was only ten or twelve years old. They took him to stay with other men and she and her daughter went in one room and mother and I were in another in another cell, and uh as a matter of fact the first cell had only one bed and we didn't know how, so we slept like this, like sardines. We had funny things that happening too you know. like I said the key was so big and the key hole was that big too, so I was laying in bed like this and all of a sudden I said mother, somebody is looking at me, somebody is looking at me. She said who's going to look. So anyhow there was a prisoner outside that had it wasn't you know a penitentiary or anything. It was an old jail where people was kept and all of a sudden I see, there comes a knife with a pad of butter through this key hole. And this was apparently in __ or something that could order his own food in there and he had wonderful breakfast and he wanted us to have a pad of butter. Oh, we had all kinds of . . . then we heard singing. . . Hebrew songs, Jewish songs, singing. And there was another group of refugees. They wanted us to know that they are there. You know, they couldn't communicate with us any different way, so we heard this singing and so when the regular prisoners were, they had time out in the morning to make their beds and to empty their sinks (ph) and so you know they kept us in the cells, but when they were, when the regular prisoners were in their cells during the day, then they kept us, we could go out in the hallways. And they were great big hallways with and we met with the other refugees and you know, it wasn't so bad. And we, we got food and we uh the basement they had bathtubs. We could even take a bath. And not everyday but you know, they were very nice. But the food of course wasn't too great so my mother was always afraid that I was going to starve you know, the regular Jewish mother. So one day she said to this, to the , can't I get anything else for my <span class="page-break" number="13"></span> 1 food until at night and we got the whole meal at night and it was OK. But then mother and I we were the only ones left and it got colder already and we didn't have any clothes so there was one family in had a beautiful department store, wealthy Swiss Jews and they always came visiting and see, to see what they can do for the refugees and uh when you know it got colder then uh mother said to them we really don't have any clothes and you know Switzerland is, gets cold pretty soon. Oh, they said, there's no problem.</p><p>And he asked the prison warden, you know, can these people come to my store and pick out clothes, and he said yes. So was a very strange situation. They opened the gates and mother and I we walked out and we went to the store, and the lady invited us up for tea.</p><p>We had beautiful tea in the salon with cake and you know, like real people and he took us around in the store, and he said pick out what you need you know, was for winter and it became a habit. We went every day we went out walking and five o'clock we went back to the prison. You know, there was no place else to go. Was home. But of course not for very long. Then I got sick and we got to the Salvation Army and we stayed at the Salvation Army a little bit and then in the meantime this Mrs. Matulski and her two children came the same way we came and she was a very nervous person so she took some sleeping pills and she slept through the border. She was, and the boy was already you know children have to grow up pretty quick. He gave the policemen the the patrol their papers and she slept. So they thought if this lady sleep so well she can't be very nervous. So they made it too. And they were already in a camp uh like they called</p><p> lager it was the beginning where people got processed. And she wrote to Mother we are here and it's very nice. We even have curtains on the window. We have and it's not so bad and why don't you try coming here. So while we were at the Salvation Army, we went to this to the police to the you know, and my mother said we have friends at this camp. We wouldn't mind going there. So he said Mrs. Blachman, I don't think <span class="page-break" number="14"></span> 2 an school in France at uh one night they was going to be deported and the policemen came to the director of that____ school and said, send your oldest ones, the ones that you think can make it on their own, out tonight because tomorrow morning the SS is coming to take all the kids. So he was seventeen, eighteen, in the meantime and the director gave them whatever they could and money or whatever little, and he had made it to Switzerland. Like over five or six weeks he walked, in hotels and he walked at night and slept in daytime and he spoke beautiful French. He was very talented with languages.</p><p>Spoke a perfect French. He worked for a time in the French youth group and they had trouble with them and I don't know how he made it to Geneva coming from south of France. He made it in to Geneva and in Geneva he got on the train. He was never caught.</p><p>He was never__ and he traveled to Zurich to his uncle and he presented he had an uncle or a relative in Zurich and he presented himself there. And uh the uncle said I am very happy but you can't stay with me for the rest of... you have to go to the police and present yourself, you know, tell them. So they sent him to a different camp but not back you know. So he wrote to my relatives we had given each other the addresses so in case you know there were, and here he is also in Switzerland. And uh so the next spring by coincidence he got into what called . That was also nearby but maybe two hours by foot from my camp to his camp. And uh at that time we weren't allowed to go much yet but he sent, some other young man came and told me about him and maybe we could use telephone or something, I don't know. But anyhow we got together and that's really when our courtship started and we walked and walked to get to each other you know. It was down to and up through the fields and there were beautiful cherry orchards in the summer and the things were... Each had to walk an hour to meet and then we started walking because there was no place to go. I mean we couldn't you know was a very strange courtship but... Sometimes we met in the little town in the winter and we sat in the tearoom and had uh coffee or tea or called cafe in Switzerland. Was this <span class="page-break" number="15"></span> 3 stuck it out. He came back one weekend to see me and then finally my papers came through and I came to Bern too and we were together. I mean he stayed, he had to live there under very bad conditions and very dirty conditions. You know, but <span class="page-break" number="15"></span> 4</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, bring us to the close of the war. Tell us what happened.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, by then the war was almost over. As a matter of fact on the on the, I have a newspaper uh Bern, from Bern, where the headline is Hitler is dead, on the thirtieth, I think it was the thirtieth of April, 1945, and then the, and the civil column was of our marriage announcement. It's in the same paper, and was a big headline you know. And so uh, well sure there was uh the the landing in in France you know, when the Americans landed in France and we were listening to the radio, but we were powerless. We couldn't participate. We could only listen and hope and pray that the war will end. Then slowly came the news out about the concentration camps, but it came only at the very end that we heard about the liberation of the camps and what went on there. We had no, we didn't know anything about that. So we had no more, you know, we didn't hear from my father anymore and as a matter of fact long afterwards somebody told us, I don't know if this is the truth or not, that he was put into one of those famous uh railway cars and that they died in there, that he never made it to the camp. I don't know whether this is reliable truth or not, but that's what we heard from people who said they knew him. And my mother's brother didn't come back. He was in Drancy. He was sent back. And my grandparents and my husband's parents and actually only Mother and I made it through you know, through Switzerland. So we went, when the Red Cross sent us back to Brussels after a few months, about six or seven months after the end of the war, and my son was born there three years, two years, three years later, and we actually all wanted to go to Ecuador. I have an uncle in, my husband had an uncle in Ecuador and after that didn't materialize it was always a delay and all things so my step-father, my mother had remarried in the meantime, and my, the brother of my step father had a farm in , New Jersey and he said if you'd like to come, you know, and we started working then we had to, started at the blouse factory after I had been working in Switzerland for blouses and I had uh taken some private lessons from the uh lady who did the models and who did the patterns. I went at night to her place and learned that too, because the sewing alone wasn't enough, so I did this and my step father helped cut and my mother started selling and we had a beautiful little business going. But like I said they presented us with the signature then that we were, we had promised to leave and our status was semi-legal. I mean they prolonged, every six months they prolonged our papers you know. But we weren't citizens and then my son was born and he, they made him , not an <span class="page-break" number="16"></span> 5 wonderful wives and children and they are full American and you know, like born here and this was the right decision I think.</p></p></dialogue>
