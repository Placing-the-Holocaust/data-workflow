One day as I was working there and somebody rang the bell and I opened the bell and I saw two so-called Hungarian Nazis who were worse sometimes than the Germans were. I thought well that's it. They will take me. But they came and they took my boss because he was in the religious. They did not like very religious people either. They took him to a concentration camp and I, the secretary, Jewish secretary whom they didn't know, stayed there. So that was a rather almost humorous aspect of that case. So I stayed there for a couple of months without him. When things got to be very dangerous, then I knew the safe number of that lawyer. That was right before things got very serious already. Then I opened up the safe and took out his -- the lawyer's daughter's papers, knowing if I have to run away, I will run away with this papers which I did. Which I used, but that happened later on.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you want to tell me how?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, that -- first of all, I have to tell you that we were -- my father and mother were Polish origin. In 1941, when the Germans were not occupying Hungary yet, they came out -- they give the order to the Hungarians to deport all the non-Hungarian citizens. My father in spite of that, that he was as a Hungarian officer in the Hungarian army and he had the Iron Cross and all that things, when the order came out to deport -- you know there was a time in Hungary and when all the non-Hungarian were deported from Hungary and from Budapest. Unfortunately, we were among them and unfortunately we were among them the very first thing when that deportation started, when we didn't know yet what's going on. They came to our house and they said, pack your bag, we will take you to your own country. You will work there and you will survive after the war. That was in June, 1941. They came to our house and they said well pack your bag and go. How do you pack your bag when you live there a lifetime? So we cried and my mother cried and I cried and my fiance was there. So the guy, he was new on the job and he had a certain human caring and sympathy to us said, you know what, I will take your father so I'm sure you stay here. You have one day to pack your bag and do whatever you want.</p><p>That's what he did. In that one day, I had a choice and some people, some relatives told me, you are young, go and hide before they take you. But my father wrote a letter that the family has to stay together. Please come and whatever will be, we will survive it together. So we packed our bag and we went outside. We lived in a house, four floors. All the tenants were looking and saying goodbye to us. Some of them cheering, some of them jeering. That's how we were deported to Poland at that time. I say deported to Poland which is again easy to say but how we were and what happened and how we went there and how we walked or whatever happened. In between a lot of Hungarian, so-called Polish-Hungarian origin got killed in Kamieniec Padolski. That was a famous town where they -- you heard about Kamieniec Podolski.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So then most of them who got killed there 40,000, they were all Hungarian origin. But knowing my parents knew Polish, they all hired a private buggy and we had relatives in Kolomjya. We stayed -- we hid back from the transport because we knew that the transport is going to Kamieniec Padolski. A lot of other people escaped too but we went with that buggy to Kolomyja and that's where we stayed in Kolomjya, that was that time, yes, more or less normal life because the ghetto was not easy. But of course, after a year being in the ghetto and losing people -- it was over 20,000 people in Kolomyja -- by the time I escaped as a smuggler, there was only a couple of hundred left. That's when it was that I said goodbye to my parents and of</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

I started on the road going back to Hungary which was a bad road to talk about a lot.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you ever talk to anyone about the ghetto though, before ---?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The ghetto, we lived, it was a whole year. Before the ghetto, we lived in Kolomyja yet. When the ghetto came, of course, like everybody else, we had to move in the ghetto. We also had the -- they said on the tape that three, four families lived in the ghetto. Well, where we went, it was rather five, six families living in the ghetto.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In one room place?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In a one room place, right. Then, of course, some of them got killed during the time, so it got less and less. That's when I decided after a year being in Kolomyja and about half a year in the ghetto, it's time to go</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was there anything while you were there that struck you and made a -- that stands out in your mind?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Every day struck me because I was a young person who was rather careful living and all suddenly you are tossed in this situation. We went to work in the morning because my father being a military person and the Germans also gave him a job as a supervisor. The other Jews didn't like him because he was a supervisor. They didn't like nobody who supervised over other Jews. So we worked there for a time. As a matter of fact, I worked in a kitchen preparing dinner for German officers. My job was -- with three other girls -- peeling potatoes. At that time, hunger was already a big aspect of ghetto life because you know that people just died of hunger. So what we did, we got permission for the peels to take home. We had the peels for whatever meals we made.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You cooked them?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We cooked the peels, right. But in order to have something on the peels, we peeled the potatoes in the kitchen thick. Then we went home and we peeled the pieces.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We made it so that the peels were thick but then the Germans came to it and they said that whoever will peel like that thick, will have a punishment. So we couldn't do that. From then on, we had to eat the peels and not peel the peels. The other one what I remember from the ghetto, when we went out to work. Through work, we got to know some other workers. This was German families who moved into Jewish houses. They renovated and redecorated a little; we worked on it, to keep it clean until their wife and children came. We saw the mementoes of a life, you know Jewish life, sometimes we came into a house where we saw the pots and pans yet as they carried them out. We just had to close our eyes and see what happened there. We had to clean up and make it ready for the German officers. I was working there once washing the floors with a pail, you know a big pail of water. Because you're asking me to tell you memories from the ghetto.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So the German --. Until that time, you know, I knew that I was in danger and everything but I didn't have any personal contact with any physical punishment. Cleaning the floor and almost finished it, he came in and he took the pail and he kicked the pail and he said this is not clean enough, clean it again. So that was my first encounter with a German officer. As it happened to be, the German officer's wife came back. She acted rather humanely to the Jewish girls. It happened to be that, I don't know whether I should mention it, but everything -- but she had some tendencies for liking girls. The question was whether to use this situation to your advantage or not to use it to your advantage. But sometimes, it came to a point, you told me an incident before about bread. Sometimes you came to a point when the only thing on your mind was, you are twenty years old and somewhere along in the sky when you looked up, there is a life yet for people. Let's do whatever is possible but let's survive. It happens to be that that woman helped me a lot to get easier job, to get more food until her husband came to the picture.</p><p>Then I lost my job. Then we had to go to a factory where he worked, some kind of, if I remember correctly, I think something with an ironwork or something. The first day when I went there, we were rather abused that time there. Then I decided that this is a good place maybe to run away or something or make connections and that's what I heard the first time, that there is somewhere a small that it is possible to --. I stayed in that factory and I <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection will be that I have to go, then I have to decide which of my children will have it. That was the ghetto and I went away. I went back to Budapest where that time even so that Hitler was far and advancing all over; it was still not the ghetto. Only a couple of months later ---.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What year was this?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was there a whole year in the ghetto. From 1941 to 1942. I have tell you one incident there because that is an -- I try not to go into little details but --.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No, it's okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But this detail was so remarkable that I have to mention it. After about 25 or 26 days -- the 20" day they caught us. I think -- did I mention it or didn't I mention it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We were -- oh, I told you that before. We were walking at night to reach Hungary from Poland.</p><p>I mean it was a long road but I cannot go into every aspect of it. But in any case, we were walking at night and sleeping at daytime. That was just about the last day before we saw already, the Hungarian border when somebody probably who noticed us, told it to the German guards. They came up this -- we were ten of us who were escaping from the ghetto -- they came up, the German guards and they shot everybody on sight. I ran away that time and it was laying there a big tree eaten up from the moss. You know, hollow inside. There is a lot of fate was in my life what I have to strongly believe that there must be something, somebody, somewhere who prepared that tree for me there, where I went in that tree, in that hollow tree.</p><p>Was laying and I was laying; I was in the tree. I just heard the shooting and the crying and saying no, no; until everything got quiet. I walked out from the tree and what I saw only dead people. I started to walk because I think that time; from that day on I was not quite right. I think I was singing or something. I said, I'm going back to mamma and how wonderful it is. I stumbled, by accident, over the smuggler who was also escaping, but not only that he was getting -- he was getting shot and escaping and I found him but everybody had a little knapsack, you know, little knapsack where we had things. He, in a big hurry, instead of taking his knapsack, took my knapsack, took my knapsack and I am the one who survived. So this little incident what I sometimes wonder how that worked out. So I found him but he was injured and he said he cannot do nothing. He gave me his pocketknife and in his tie, he was --. The trouble as they shot, they shot at my back and it went into his tie, near the genital areas. He gave me that little knife and he said that I have to take that bullet out which I did. He was there for the night and then he said, write me that letter that you are here so that I can get my money. I won't get too much in any case because from the ten of you, you are the only one survived. So that's what the paper what I showed you that I wrote him and that was from the woods. This was the Hungarian woods in Korosmezo.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Could you spell that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Korosmezo. Here I write it down. Kirsh -- this is a border town. Korosmezo. This is a border town. From there, when I am in Korosmezo, I am already in Hungary. So he said that, he covered me over with leaves and he said I don't feel good. So he left me with my knapsack what I had a little sweater on. It was cold in the woods already. He said -- he gave me an onion, by the way, which was very good. He went away and he said he will come for me. He</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection will whistle a certain way so I know because that was, even so it was in the woods, but people could still go there. He said when you hear that whistle, then tell that this is you. So he went away and he left me there four and a half -- four days and one night. I was in the woods by myself so I was really -- can you imagine that, a twenty- year old girl in the woods, you know, rain or not rain or anything. There was one incident that something moved, I probably moved and the peasant came there who was taking lambs to eat, to raise or whatever you call it. He heard and he comes straight -- he came straight where I am. I was just huddling there covered with certain leaves there and I heard the steps closer and closer. The only thing what he did, he peed and peed on me. I was just standing there and that was one of the incidents. Then people asked me what did you eat for four days? You have to eat for four days, which is not necessarily so. But I had that one onion and then blueberries grew that time in the --. When I felt safe enough in the night. I went around me and I ate some blueberries. But the fourth night, I dreamed about my fiance in Hungary at that time. It was a beautiful wedding and everything. When I got up and I was in the situation, you know, whatever I was in there; I looked up, I said this is sh . Ican't. There was a limit what I could endure. And I said, I just don't care anymore, nothing, when I heard the whistle. So little coincidences and he did come. I told him where were you? I couldn't talk so good to him because he didn't talk Hungarian and I didn't talk so good Polish. But he said, he was sick. I mean, I believe it, I'm not such a good surgeon. He came for me the fifth day and he took me to a place where I had to walk up on the top. Because I was -- even so I was in Hungary -- I think my husband explained it. When they catch you there, then they immediately send you back to Germany. So everybody was afraid to give -- to hide you. So I was up there in the -- in some kind of an attic waiting for further instruction to go deeper into Hungary. The deeper you got into Hungary, the safer you were that the Germans -- that they won't give you over to the Germans. This was in 1942. As I was walking down the steps because he told me to come down now we are ready, we have a car and we will go to the next town which is Mag . As I walked down, I <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection and we went by. To this day, number one, I don't forget the incident. Number two, I don't believe in supernatural, I cannot quite believe it but there is a tiny little doubt in my mind whether this was not some kind of an angel set down. Because why would -- I mean it is a coincidence to be mentioned.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, yes, indeed. You had mentioned earlier when we were talking that you had some type of an encounter with Wallenberg?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, that was -- that came later. Because when -- then I came back to Hungary. In Hungary as I said at that time was, I was from 1941 to 1942 in the ghetto. At that time Germany still didn't occupy Hungary. It wasn't ghetto yet. It was my aunt there and she asked me what it was like and what she didn't believe. I ate potato peels and stuff like that. But as we closed into the year, more and more Germans came to Hungary until finally on the main street of Hungary, the Germans marched in and that was the end. Hungary was occupied by Germany. You know Horthy, Horthy was the ---. So he went away with his white horse and stuff like that. He tried, as a matter of fact, to save the Jews but he was too weak to do anything in that respect. Then the Germans came in and then, of course, the Germans took over like they took over the other countries. Then came the ghetto. Knowing what the ghetto is because | had a little bit of experience before, so I said I am not going to go in the ghetto. As I said, I worked with a lawyer and I had this papers from this lawyer's daughter what I stole from the safe. I said I'm not and my aunt said, well come with us and everything. She said, by the way, that time she said, now I know what you told me, what went on in the ghetto. I can believe it now more. As the year went by, she believed me unfortunately more and more. She was a very lovely lady, very nice aunt what I had. They all went to ghetto and I went with the Catholic papers, you know where the Balaton is?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's a lake, Balaton Lake. I was working with my friend, with a Hungarian friend of mine as a maid and a nurse. One week I was the maid and she was the nurse. One week I was the nurse and she was the maid. We worked there a month with my papers what I had and she had other papers. Catholic, we went to church and I learned to pray and all stuff with the children. One day a policeman comes to our house and checks our papers. He checked her paper, he checked my paper and said okay, we will check it out and we'll come for you in the morning.. I knew that they will check out my papers, this was an aristocrat what I worked. He had a von you know, that lawyer's. So I knew that they will know it at the staff that I am not the daughter from that aristocratic man. So I said to my friend, Monica, I said, you know what. They will know that we have papers, let's run away. We went out to the railroad in the night. I had four children there. Parents were somewhere else so I tucked them in and I hoped nothing ill happen to the children. We went through the window and we went to the railroad station. At the railroad station we met the same guy who came that day for us, for our papers. That was the end of our freedom. They caught both of us and that's how we went from camp to camp to camp to camp.. I was that time, that was in 1943, so two years ---.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: These were all Hungarian workers?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: These were all Hungarian workers only that one which was the Austrian <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection can tell you that I had many, many incidents.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Which one or two stands out?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The one with Wallenberg, the one what stands out. We were in -- that was I think, it was at Sarvar, you see my memory is failing me too. What Wallenberg did, he had a truck. He had a list of names. He went to this camps because from this camps, because like for instance at the Sarvar where we were, there was the camp where the war was full-written, goodbye, goodbye because from Sarvar they went to the German concentration camps. This was a collective camp -- where they collected people when they had enough. Because they didn't take just a hundred people, they didn't take. When there were more, then they took them away. So this was a camp where from on, there was only one way. So Wallenberg with his truck, and his men went to this camps with a list. At that time, they still acknowledged Wallenberg's authority. So he came to the camp and we were all standing there and the German guard -- not the German, the Hungarian guard came with him. He said, this list what I'm reading, all stand forward.</p><p>Because this is under the Swiss protection. He had that list. 1 was in that Swiss house. That's how he knew me by name. I think I mentioned it to you that I was there. So he comes near me and I remember his face and everything. They called him the Angel of the Jews because he saved so many Jews. He stand before me and he says are you Margit so- and- so. I was a little, I guess I was stupid because I didn't want to say nothing because I went after the rules. I am not that. The girl next kicked me and said so why don't you say that this is you -- that you are Margit so- and -so. I said yes, yes, I am Margit so-and-so. He said well, why don't you step forward, he tells me, Wallenberg. What does it take so long to recognize your name? I stepped forward and he took us in the bus. They took us back to Budapest. That was one encounter what I had with Wallenberg in person. I went back to Budapest and now I didn't have again papers. The other things what I had from my father. You know, they wore this gold watches.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Pocket watches.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was a chain and --. I had that chain. I had that gold chain. I sewed it in -- not my girdle, I didn't wear a girdle -- but what holds the stockings, how do you call that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The . garter belt.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Garter belt. I sewed that up the garter belt around it and for that garter belt, I bought the papers what I still have home. This is the papers what I showed you. With that papers, I left in one of the Christian -- I never went to the ghetto. I went to the house. Budapest was very, very hard bombed. Of course, between the bombing and the Germans coming to the -- where we went in the basement, how do you call that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The bomb shelter?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The bomb shelters, we were. Between that and that. I sometimes walked on the streets. The bombs were falling, the dead people were around me but I felt safer there than in the bomb shelter because the more it bombed, the more and more Germans came -- they had nothing better to do. The more and more came to the shelter and took out people and took them out to the Danube. The Danube was floating with thousands of people. As a matter of fact , I will tell you, remind me if I forget it, because I have to tell you a very important incident after the war, after the , remind me from that. So, now what did I tell you before? <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The Danube was --.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yes. So January 18, we were liberated by the Russians and January 16, they still came, the Germans looking for Jews. One of them when they came in and I was there in the shelter. I couldn't walk any more on the street because it was just really 100 % because the bombs were falling like anything. There I made an acquaintance -- you see -- I must also tell you one other aspect what I don't like to go into that -- it maybe sometimes embarrassing. But I said after the ghetto, that I came back. I said I have to survive. Standing or laying but I will survive. Was no morality left in me. Even so I was brought up in a house where, if I wasn't home by eight o'clock my father was walking before the house, you know. There was one guy who said well, I think, I am almost sure that he knew I was Jewish. But he somehow got a liking to me and he said that if I'm nice, he will be nice. I said, I will be as nice as you want me to be. When the guy came to check the -- because they checked the papers, who is Jewish, who is not Jewish.</p><p>There was another family there, a woman and her husband and a son. A nice, fat, beautiful looking Jewish boy. She was with papers and I was with papers. Somehow one Jew recognized the other one. Somehow be feeling or by look or by eyes. There was some kind of rapport that one Jew knew what the other Jew. But one aspect of this which is maybe nobody told you, or maybe they did; there was one aspect to it, when one Jew was caught, then they had the tendency unfortunately, if I was caught, then you should be caught too. I don't go into psychological reasoning but maybe there is a reasoning what there is an answer to it. When the German guy, when that Nazi came to check the papers, this other boy was standing beside me.</p><p>(End of Side A)</p><p> Oh, yes. In any case, as I said they came this Nazis, the Hungarian Nazis what they call this the Millerkaras, that was the Hungarian name. They were sometimes more brutal and more perverse than the Germans, if you can be more.</p></p></dialogue>

I was a prostitute according to my papers, that kind of papers I had. I certainly acted sometimes accordingly. That's another story. In any case, they went away and they took them out and they shot them. Now I have to interject here now, a scene. This people whom they shot before the house, she had a brother. After the war, when we were still in that house, the brother came to pick up whatever they had. Then they said, I heard that there was somebody here, some shiksa here, who took away my dead brother's room. They shot before the house, the . I want to confront that woman. I was still, because at that <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection you save mine? How can I save you?, I said. You know how you can save it. So he knew who I was. Because he wouldn't ask me that question then whether I can save your life or not.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>When the Russians came in, when they were already looking for Hungarian soldiers, or non- Jews, you know, he came to me and he said, help me to get out of here. I helped you, you help me. And I did help him to escape. Whether I did it right or wrong, but I did it and he did escape. I don't know what happened to him. Well, in any case, then the Russians came in and then of course, it started. I don't know whether you know about the aspects of how the Russians behaved. It was soup kitchens again and it was again standing in the line. It was all the ruins and I had nobody. I just walked on the streets, you know. Sawing people coming out of the ghetto. Everybody says, oh Yaneka, 5 5 , and I went <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> it, take it. If you went out empty handed, they send you back to take something. So I'm living there in that house where above it was a department store. In this department store, I thought I will go looting too. Why not, the other people go, but I didn't. I didn't prepare myself with the proper thing. I didn't have a bag, I didn't have a knife, I didn't have the scissors so I was not quite made for this looting business. There was big giant men there carting materials and everything. I was just there. If they make me , I was some 85 or 90 pounds, if they gave me a push, I would just fall down. They said if you want to live, you better go away. I want to loot so I went down where the food was. There in the food, people went also and took the silverware and whatever it is. Finally, one guy lifted me up and put me on a bag of flour. He said you stay here if you want to be alive. Because they were strong people and I was just a -- the wind could blow me away that time. I was still there, people took everything and I stood there with -- on the bag of flour until everything was looted out. I stood there with the bag of flour. Of course,, I couldn't take the bag of flour and that was full with pickles and jams and everything. On me, but I still was sitting on a bag of flour. What did I do? I had one and only dress and I took the flour and I put it in my -- here like this, in there. I went all the way walked that way to my landlady and I said, here we have flour, we make bread from it. Which we took out the glass and we did make bread from it. But after a while, it was got to -- I lived that time, I went away from my aunt and I lived in a friend's of mine, the same friend who was together with me in the camp.
