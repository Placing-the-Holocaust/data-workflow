Thank you very, very much Mrs. Baitch for agreeing to meet with us today, to share your story, your experiences, and with that, to allow others to know about what those were, and how that fit into the large mosaic and picture of the tragic time of the Holocaust.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: We're going to start at the very beginning. I'd like to find out as much as I can about your prewar life. I know that in some cases, with some people, that can present some challenges. The reason why we try to go in as much detail as we can, is that we want to get a sense of the world that you were born into, the forces that shaped you -- the first initial ones, and get a picture of what this world was, before it was lost. So, my very first question is, could you tell me the date of your birth?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: |-- the image that -- that I think of when I think of my childhood, is one of secrecy, shushing, rumors, and sadness, and fear.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's -- that's the kind of overall feel that I have from my small years.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How sad.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That -- yes. Well, I didn't -- I didn't know any different.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Of course.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: But I--I tried to make sense of it, but --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But you know that a small child's life is based on a feeling --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes, and that's --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- you know, is based on emotion.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- that's -- that's what I remember.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's what stays.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And that's the one that's the most popular in this country, so --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Can you -- do you have any memory of your father as, you know, doing something? Do you have memory of him working, do you have memory of him at home?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: 1 th--Idon't have a memory of my father in a grocery store.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So let's step back a little bit. Can you tell me that -- one of the questions I usually ask is, how did your parents support the family, that is, and you kind of answered it now. So what was your father's business? What did he do?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They had a small grocery.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was it a neighborhood grocery store?</p></p></dialogue>

My mother's letters had an address that she wrote letters to me from. But, in later years, we went to that address in Vienna, and it did not seem like the same pla -- I --I did not relate to it in any way.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It might have been that she had to move.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. Yes, I learned that, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah. So --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And I don't know what the address was on my records, because I had no -- my records were private with the agency.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So I never found out much information about where I lived, and so forth.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So again, in your mind's eye, you -- do you have any image of a particular room from your childhood, a bedroom, a living room, a kitchen?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I don't.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay. Do --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: My--- my most vivid memory is of my mother and me going to the streets for a parade. And it was an immense parade, and all the Nazi banners were -- and bunting, were all over the place. And I remember the sound of the boots of the <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion Interview with Herta Baitch " May 10", 2016 soldiers, and loud music, and a lot of sieg heils. And I didn't know anything about what was going on, and my mother just held -- I remember her squeezing my hand, and I said, what is this? And she said, it's going to be very bad. That is the only vivid memory that I have.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Wow.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I remember the pounding on the pavement, on the street, and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: What can you tell me about your mother? Is she someone who is more in your memory than your father?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, yes, but not as much as I would -- I would think. Not as much as I would think I-- I would remember of my mother. She did embroidery, and she worked in the store. And I think I was taken care of by another woman when she went to the store. I don't remember the store. I don't -- I don't know whether I'm protecting myself, or -- I have no memories of hugging my mother, kissing my mother. I don't have those memories.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Or of the reverse, of her kissing you and hugging you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes, yes, I-- I don't -- I don't have those memories. I don't have any memories of my schooling, of friends. That's -- that's been a blank. That's bi -- the whole -- that -- until I came to the United States, and even for about a week or so, until I went into my first foster home, that has all been a blank. <span class="page-break" number="11"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Herta Baitch 6 May 10", 2016</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And to this day?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And to this day, I don't have a memory of being in my mother's arms, and there is one memory that I do remember. We were sitting in a chair at the end of Shabbat, and waiting for the stars to come out. That is a memory. That's a -- that -- that is a good memory. And, we were waiting for the stars to come out, and my mother said that there's a moment just after Shabbat ends, and the stars come out, something like that, she said, you can see God.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And I remember being in a chair with her. That -- that -- that's about the closest memory that I have. Even leaving, I -- I remember that she told me I was coming to the United States, and that another Jewish mother would take care of me, and -- and that I had to be very healthy. And these -- these are the things that I -- I remember being in a shul. I think it was a shul, and people were crying, and she made me leave. My father was holding a Torah, and I just assume now that that must have been a Yizkor service, because people were crying, and she wanted me to leave.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: For those people, and myself included, who don't know what a Yizkor service is, could you tell us?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: It's usually on Yom Kippur, and it's a -- it's a part of the service that remem -- where you remember your parents, and you say a memorial prayer for -- for those <span class="page-break" number="12"></span> ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion Interview with Herta Baitch 6 May 10", 2016 who've -- you've left behind.

I don't remember singing with my father, but I-- I know I did. I know I did, but I don't remember it. The chair, sitting in the chair, watching the stars, the me -- the shul, and the parade.

<dialogue class=""><p>Q2: The museum recently acquired the research collection of Leonard and Edith Ehrlich, two survivors from Vienna, who spend a good 40 years researching the history of the Jewish community Vienna during the Holocaust. And having emigrated to the United States, they spent many years interviewing survivors from Vienna who were in the United States. And those survivors, and these interviews were done in the 1970s, so the survivors whom they interviewed were often individuals who had a role within the administration of the Jewish community Vienna. The research collection includes dozens of these audio cassette tapes, <span class="page-break" number="48"></span> ontactrefieannedjustanmiang er hither btemelortabnattfiexaliaton Interview with Herta Baitch * May 10", 2016 which the museum only recently digitized, and we still have not gone through all of the cassette tapes, but we started to do so just only recently, and we came across one interview that was conducted in December 27", 1974, in New York, in the office of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, and it is an interview with Margaret Feiler, the name who -- who you will recognize. She is the only adult chaperone who was on your transport. And the interview is, all in all, it's about three hours long, and -- and she recounts everything that she did for the Jewish community. And at one point in the interview, she starts to mention an American committee for children, which arranged for originally 30 children to be brought to the United States, and then in the end, eight or nine children ended up being on the transport.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh my God.</p><p>Q2: And that is the ex -- the excerpt that we would like to play for you now. It's about nine minutes long. [technical problem] [The following is from the 1974 interview with Margaret Feiler. For the full audio recording, see Oral history interview with Margaret Feiler, RG-50.862.0001, United States Holocaust Memorial Museum collection] "M: ...for a group of children, I think it was 30-odd children. There must be something on file on this. Probably not on this file, but she has the file. Children <span class="page-break" number="49"></span> ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion Interview with Herta Baitch a May 10", 2016 whose fathers had died in some concentration camp, either Buchenwald or Dachau, and whose mother had a quota which didn't come up; Hungarian or Romanian or Polish. Such children -- they made a group of such children, of 30-odd children, and they arranged for foster parents, here in the United States. The community intended to send, I think it was two social workers, who also wanted to emigrate, who had the affidavits, sent them with the children to the United States.</p><p>They all required for visa around August -- September. And of the children, only nine got visas, for reasons which we never knew. And none of the two social workers got visa. And nobody else got visa, not in September. Not in August, not in September, I don't know how far back, but not in August, not in September, and not before I got my visa. Now, I started talking to anybo -- I [indecipherable] when I got the visa, they asked me whether I would take those nine children, and that's what I did. And that's how JDC even paid for my fare, because I was the escort. They paid for those nine children's fare, and my own, and we came here. I went via Berlin, where I picked up the 10" child, that also wasn't [indecipherable] and I brought them to the United States, via Lisbon. It was the first transport via Lisbon, through occupied France [indecipherable]. Now, to come back to the visa, I asked the people who had gone to the consulate, two social workers, and everybody else to whom I could talk, because most of them came to the community in order to <span class="page-break" number="50"></span> ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion Interview with Herta Baitch ~ May 10", 2016 communicate to their relatives here that they couldn't come because they didn't get the vi -- the visa. I asked them, what were you asked, because they were asked questions. And there was one thing that they all had in common, all of them. There must have been 20 people. They had been asked how they had voted in the last election, in the last free election that Austria had, which was some time in spring -- I don't know when it was. The last thing -- I asked that question, how -- I: Is that before or -- before -- M: Before Hitler.</p><p>I: 1934?</p><p>M: Right.</p><p>I: There was not election -- M: No, no, no, no, no, we had elections to -- I: Was there election between "34 and "38?</p><p>M: Oh yes, yes, there was. Was [indecipherable] But they have asked them --I can't re --I can't really tell you what year it was, because I know only the question. But they asked, how did you vote during the last three elections? And all of them, every one of them had said, either a social democrat or a Christian socialist. Well, there was no other party. Very few said Christian socialist, but I know that the very few who had said that, and one had said social democrat. None of them had gotten a <span class="page-break" number="51"></span> ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion Interview with Herta Baitch degdeg May 10", 2016 visa. And the other questions, I didn't find any other question that could be [indecipherable]. So I started thinking. And I was asked the same question. Well, I didn't know what [indecipherable], but there was a so-called democratic [indecipherable] which I think [indecipherable] in all of -- of Vienna. Well, it was a hopeless affair. It was somebody who really --I can't --I can't think why anybody would spend money on something like that, but it was idealism. Now don't ask me whether I quor -- voted for that, because I won't admit anything. But when I was asked, that's what I said. And all I can tell you is that I got the visa.</p><p>I: [inaudible] M: That's -- that was my [indecipherable]. So anyway, I got the visa, and when I came for the examination, you know, you had a medical examination, this is the second point for the American consulate [indecipherable] whatever you want to say, they asked me two questions. One said -- one question was, what is your true hair color -- implying that it was dyed, which it never was, and the second was, in what month are you [indecipherable] I: It was what?</p><p>M: In what month are you [indecipherable]. These were the two questions. So --I mean, you can imagine the atmosphere, this was the atmosphere. So anyway, I got the visa in October, I got the -- I left on November 30", I brought the children out. <span class="page-break" number="52"></span> ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion Interview with Herta Baitch deg May 10", 2016 There are some --I don't think it's here on file, and I don't think I have it. I had written a column for that newspaper that the community [indecipherable] was called in those days, and I wrote about how I brought back the children, and it was very interesting for the people [inaudible]. So that was the story of, in those days, of the immigration. Now, of course, this is what I know myself: Now one other thing.</p><p>Murmelstein had over [indecipherable] was very anxious [indecipherable] but he also [indecipherable]. And so the only hope was that a job offer would come from the United States. And he was afraid -- first of all, he didn't want to stay.</p><p>[indecipherable] to stay, but I was so optimistic, he didn't want to stay. Number two, he was afraid that the more he knew, and the more he was involved with the Gestapo, they may, in the end, not let him go, not let him even survive. He was always afraid for his life. He said he's getting deeper and deeper into this, and he is not going to survive. So when I went to the United States, I promised [indecipherable] when I come here, that I would see Rabbi Young, and that I would talk to Rabbi Young, and ask him to get him a job offer as a rabbi.</p><p>I: Who is Rabbi Young?</p><p>M: Rabbi Young is -- has a-- a community, a -- a-- a synagogue on the west side. I can get you details from [indecipherable]. He is of German extraction. He's not a refugee, but he is -- when you talk to him, you can hear he is German. That the first <span class="page-break" number="53"></span> ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion Interview with Herta Baitch " May 10", 2016 thing I did --I--I don't know whether it was the first week or the second week. But you see, as [indecipherable] in New Rochelle in jan -- the end of January. So it must -- all this was the end -- the last few days in December, the first two days in January. Before I did anything, I went to Rabbi Young. I was admitted to his study, and I started to talk, and he cut me short and he said, not a word about Murmelstein. Don't mention the name to me. I know all about him. I said, now, wait a minute. I've been working with him. Don't tell me, I know all about it. There is not a thing I'm going to do, he should be happy his name isn't mentioned in the United States. And he practically threw me out, I mean it's -- he -- he -- he was polite enough to say goodbye, but you know [indecipherable]. So I wrote it. I wrote to Murmelstein about it, and this what I want to tell you, because you see, I don't know how Murmelstein behaved in Theresienstadt. I can imagine that all sorts of things happened. It could be, because the atmosphere in Theresienstadt was quite different from the atmosphere in Vienna, and I don't know what people do to survive [indecipherable]. All sorts of things can have happened. But I do know what happened when I was still in Vienna, and I know that there was nothing that he did [indecipherable] because I was [indecipherable] all night. I went home to have a shower, you know, that was it. And nevertheless, that rumor had reached already the United States, at that time.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And was Rabbi Murmelstein the head of the Viennese Jewish community? Was</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: As far as I know. There was a meeting of the Jewish community, and I-- I'm only telling you this because Stella told me.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That he -- they have to get the children out, if they can.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He was involved in that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I see. I see. How did it-- when you first heard that we had her voice on tape --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: [--I---I mean, she is such a -- on the trip, according to Stella -- I hate, you know, I have to keep mentioning her name -- she mentioned Margaret Feiler as such a very uncaring woman, who was really not with us very much. It seemed that the children were by themselves, and that the 15 -- two 15 year olds sort of took upon themselves to take care of -- of us, while we were en route.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm. It's interesting that -- first of all, it's interesting, and it's not surprising that people have different memories of a same event. Or, as in you have said over <span class="page-break" number="56"></span> ontactrefieannedjustanmiang er hither btemelortabnattfiexaliaton Interview with Herta Baitch * May 10", 2016 and over again in your case, you don't have a memory of it. And that -- that how Margaret Feiler, 35 years after she brings these children over, is remembering in her own mind what are the things that were salient for her, as she's telling the Ehrlichs about how she leaves Vienna, how she answers a question that has nothing to do with anything, you know, that is -- deals with who did you vote for in the last free elections, you know. And why that would be significant.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Is that what they asked people, to get a visa?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: That's what she is saying, that the social workers --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, my mother was not an Austrian citizen, so this -- this would have been a moot point.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. I --I don't know, but it could be that she was referring to the people who were supposed to accompany the children.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, maybe so. Now, did she say there was more than one?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It made -- it sounded like that, that others were supposed to come with more children, but that they answered in the wrong way, and didn't get a visa. She is leaving it -- this is her supposition.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How long were you with the Baer(ph) family?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The associated -- the organization that took care of me, sent me to summer camp, Camp Louise in Baltimore. They thought this would be good for me. I remember being very lonely at camp, and I missed the family. I missed the family very, very much, and I really didn't have a good time. And when I came home -- I don't remember how I got back and forth, but when I came home, Mrs. Baer(ph) and Mr. <span class="page-break" number="62"></span> ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion Interview with Herta Baitch *" May 10", 2016 Baer(ph) were standing at the door waiting for me, and when I went into the house, my suitcase was there.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: This suitcase was all packed up. And he told me that I was going to another foster home. What happened was that Mrs. Baer(ph), unbeknownst to anybody, had another baby. She was pregnant, and she was rotund, and nobody knew that she was pregnant, not even her husband or her family. I think she left a note in a milk bottle, or something like that. But she went to Sinai Hospital, to have a baby.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh my.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So that was her fourth child. And the -- Mrs. Beazer(ph) and the agency did not think it was appropriate for me to stay in this home with the new baby, and that it was too much for Mrs. Baer(ph).</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It was quite a loss for you, though.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: It was very sudden, very sudden. And -- and I -- thank you -- I went to a-- my second foster home.

And there was nobody there, except for the girl that upstaged me.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So they asked me to tell the story to the -- to the family. And I--I keep in touch with the two girls.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Wow.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And evidently, they were -- I was their first foster child. And after I left -- I guess, after some time, the agency -- the associated, used her as an interim home for short periods of time for children that were in -- families were in trouble, or something like that, until they were able to place them elsewhere. So, as I understand it, she had about a hundred foster children --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Wow. <span class="page-break" number="64"></span> ontactrefieannedjustanmiang er hither btemelortabnattfiexaliaton Interview with Herta Baitch degdeg May 10", 2016</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- after me --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Wow.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- through the years, according to the girls.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And everybody laughed, you know, the one laughed about it, and -- but it was that kind of a thing. I didn't feel like an orphan.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You know. What about the next family, who were they?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: The next family lived in a more affluent part of the city, and there were lawns and gardens and single houses. And Mrs. Baer(ph) took me over there, and I met my foster mother, she was in the garden, pulling weeds or something. And, you know, I met her, and then my new foster sister, Beverly --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Another Beverly?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- another Beverly -- came out, and I really felt like, for the first time, I looked like a refugee. I still had my high top shoes, and the clothes m-my mother sent with me. None of that had been replaced, and I had my braids. And they really looked at me as if I was from outer space. She didn't know what to make of me. First of all, she was not very prepared for -- for me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Another child? <span class="page-break" number="66"></span> ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion Interview with Herta Baitch " May 10", 2016</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: She was not prepared. It must have been a very fast -- I got the impression that it was a very fast exchange. And Beverly was two and a half years older than me. But she didn't look like a 11 or 12 year old. She -- I was, by that time, eight and a half.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>She must have been about 11 and a half. She looked like a woman. She was completely developed, and she looked much older than her years. And she was not pleased. She was not pleased that somebody was coming into the house, and certainly not me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was she a sibling -- she -- was she the only child?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: She was an only child, but she had been adopted by the Freilanders(ph) from the associated Jewish charities when she was six months old.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So, I guess the -- the organization knew about her, and I guess that they thought that it would be a good thing for Beverly to have a sister. I-- I-- I don't know, and I never found out what motivated them to step forth. So, the next door neighbor came down, Mrs. Fine(ph), my -- and -- and her daughter Phyllis. And they thought I was adorable. But I didn't get that impression from Beverly. And for the first time, I felt like a stranger. It was a bad time for me, very bad time. Everybody seemed to think I was so cute, but I didn't feel that way at home.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: What about your foster parents? <span class="page-break" number="67"></span> ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion Interview with Herta Baitch " May 10", 2016</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Mary, shortly after I came into the home, Mary li-- Mary got ill, and she suffered from high blood pressure, and headaches, and she was not a well person.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>Harry, my foster father, had a grocery store, it was a -- a nice size grocery store, and Beverly and I helped out in the grocery store. He was very soft spoken.

We ha -- slept in a single bed, because the bed hadn't been delivered yet -- a second bed hadn't delivered yet. So I really, really stepped on her. I really came in -- I can't imagine how she felt.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Sure it changed. I don't think that -- we were so different. We were so different.</p><p>Yeah, well, so-somehow we had to make peace with each other, cause we shared a room all those years. I -- I-- I-- looking back I can't even envision how -- how we managed, but we did. M-- Aunt Mary, that I call --I called them Aunt Mary and Uncle Harry, she took me to get my braids cut, because she couldn't handle my -- my long hair. And I mean, I looked, after a while, with new shoes and new clothes, I looked like anybody, and I did not have an accent, and I spoke perfect English, better than I do now. And so Beverly and I sort of made a -- a peace.

She never -- I -- I had a feeling that she knew the situation at home, but maybe -- maybe there was no place else to put me, or maybe it was just out of the question to move me again. I don't know. She never asked me how things were at home. I think she knew that Mary was sick.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Maybe it's something that she knew from the other children that she took care of, that I was -- I felt very much alone.

She was making a small living for herself. She felt very, very much relieved.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I felt very, very much alone, and whenever I went someplace, whether it was shopping with Mary, or anything, Mary seemed to know everybody, and everyone said to me, what a lucky girl you are. And I always wanted to cry every time I heard that. I knew it was -- I knew it was right. I knew they were right, but I -- I felt so--I hated that. I hated people telling me how lucky I was. And that was hard for me. I grew up feeling very much alone. I didn't know anybody else who was -- was -- had my history, and I didn't know any other children that came -- came over like I did.</p><p>So I--I grew up feeling very much alone.</p></p></dialogue>
