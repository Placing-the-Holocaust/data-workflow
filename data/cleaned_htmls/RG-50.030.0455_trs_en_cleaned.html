<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now today, I'm speaking with Juergen Simonson in a town called Ibthorpe in England. The date is the 28th of March, 1998. And Mr. Simonson is a minister and I'm going to let him talk about what got him to this country, where he lived, where he was born and I will start now. Mist -- in this country, you're called mister, even thought you're ordained, is that right?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. That's correct, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Would you be kind enough to give your name in there and tell me where you were born and where you lived as a young child and how you got to this country.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My name is J-Juergen Simonson. I come from Germany. My father was a judge in Germany.</p><p>His parents had been Jewish and then converted to the Christian faith in the last century. But, under Nazi laws we're regarded as Jews and so was my father, who was married to an Aryan, and so I was considered a mishling -- a 50 percent Jew or Aryan, whichever way you take it. We were in a small town in east Germany, where my father was working as a judge and then when Hitler came in, in "33 -- he was dismissed as judge in 1935 and lived in -- in this small town called Forst, until 1938. But because life was more difficult for somebody with a Jewish background in a small place, where everybody knew you, they were beginning to look for a move to a bigger place, where they might be more anonymous.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you have memories of that period?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yes, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What are your memories of that period?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="0"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My memories are that I went to this -- to this school in small town as second grade school and my main and most painful memory is that -- well, I noticed that for some time, my school friends distanced themselves from me. I used to walk with them to school and then there came a time when they said they wouldn't want to walk with me any more.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you were how old?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I was then -- 1938 -- 14 years old. Born in 1924. And one day, after break, I went back to my classroom and there on the notice board, written with chalk, it said, ""The -- the Juda mus game." The Jew must be out. Which of course was awful sh-shock to me. So -- my class teacher was very embarrassed about it. I left immediately. My parents had gone to Dresden -- because my father's sister lived in Dresden -- to look for somewhere to live, just at that very moment. And I was being looked after by a niece. And in the afternoon, I went to the acting headmaster to see what I should do and was told that he was resting, he could not see me. I mean -- this, sort of -- so typical, this lacking the courage of their convictions, didn't want to be involved. So after the weekend, my parents came back, they'd found a flat and within, I think 24 hours, I was on the train to Dresden. Never looked back again. And --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You felt you'd be safe in Dresden?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In Dresden, m-more. And, in fact, my father found a very good school for me, where I was admitted by the headmaster, who knew my background, but was prepared to take me on. And, until "42, I went to that school, had very good school friends and even managed to do my -- take my matric in 1942. I'll come back to that in a moment. I just want to mention that two years ago I was back in East Germany, with a Christian group, we were -- we were visiting some churches right on the Polish border. And I suddenly realized I was only about 50 miles from Forst, where I was brought up and where I had this [indecipherable].</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How do you spell that name?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: F-o-1-s-t.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Just as it sounds, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes. And decide to go by train back to Forst. It was a harrowing experience, because the town had been just on the Polish border, had been overrun by the Russians and really looked like a very neglected eastern town. It had been quite a thriving factory place, so -- in -- before "33, in the early days of Hitler. And went round the place to identify my school and one or two other places. Went back to the station, had a few minutes to spare. Went back, waited at the station for a moment. Walked down station roat and remembered that one of my school friends used to live there and he -- his father had a agricultural place, shop. And I was totally amazed that the place was still there, with the same name, Lishgut. So I walked in, the daughter-in-law was in the shop and said, "Yes, my father-in-law is here, I'll go call him." And he was out in the yard, I went out and said, "Hello, could I speak --". He didn't recognize me after 50 years. And I mentioned my name. And he looked at me, took my hand and before he said anything else, said, "I'm so very sorry for what we did to you. And it's been always on my mind." And we --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did you think he meant what he said?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- and we embraced each other and I said to -- quote, "That was a long time ago, let's forget about it." And we only had 15 minutes before my train was due, to catch up on 50 years. And then of course we kept in touch by letter afterwards. And w -- he said, "I'm so glad that we've met again." But it was an extraordinary experience. And he died a week ago.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Is that right? Did you keep up with him?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So -- yes, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, after that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: So I was so glad that --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: That you'd gone.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- I went to Forst --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- and that we met again by pure chance, really.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Luck, luck.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [indecipherable]. And there a sort of reconciliation took place, anyway.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: He probably didn't know what had happened to you, either.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. No idea.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So he must have been so glad to see --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No. Didn't know that I was in England or anywhere.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. Amazing, that's amazing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So then, as I say, I took my matric -- matric in "42. Because of my Jewish background, fortunately I was n-not allowed to be called up to the armed forces. All my school friends were.</p><p>Most of them perished, many on the eastern front. And quite a few were in Stalingrad. And in the end, there were only four of them left and we still meet, every other year, in Germany.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really, really.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So [had to do some kind of forced labor -- first in armaments factory in Dresden, on the shop floor and then in the offices.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And where were your parents now, this time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yes now, my father knew that his life was really in danger, but was very difficult to get out. You had to be sponsored by somebody abroad. And as it happened, years before, he had met a young, English student, in Forst, who was staying with a family of friends in Forst. And my  <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> </p><p> father had written to him. He'd, in the meantime, become a British diplomat and was out in the Far East, but came on leave in "38, saw this letter and wrote back to say that yes, he was prepared to sponsor him. And so in March, "39, he left us. With 10 shillings, that was all he was allowed to take. And really no -- no job in sight. I mean, as a judge, he really had no chance to find a job in England.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How many siblings did you have?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I was the only one. [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You were the only child? So when you say he left us, he left your mother and you?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My mother and me, that's right, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And, do you remember your reaction?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, of course was a terribly sad moment for all three of us, to be separated and not to know what was going to happen. Now, I think I will first tell you about my father, perhaps, at this point, because in the sequence of events, that comes next. He came to England, was met by this wonderful man, Dudley Cheek, who has since died, who later became an ambassador, British ambassador. And stayed first with -- he had some distant relatives in London and then stayed with other people, but of course had no prospect of an opening for a job. He had become an active Christian towards the end of his time in Germany. He used to go -- there was an Anglican church in London, in -- in Dresden, which he used to attend. And there was, in London, an organization called the British German Christian Fellowship, with which Bishop Bell was associated. He was the --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: The British German Christian Fellowship?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: All right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Of which he, I think, was the chairman.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And father was introduced to him and there were -- in his typical way, sort of pulled out all of the stops and eventually, in September "39, father was given a case at congregational theological college in Cambridge. Cherchant College in Cambridge. As a student again. He'd been a judge and started again from scratch --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- there, as a -- as a student.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Theological student. And in the meantime, he had also arranged for us to follow him. Again, some kind people had offered accommodation and there was even a place for me at a school near Cambridge. And we wer-were supposed to follow in September "39. September "39 of course was too late. We literally missed the boat.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Goodness.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: By about a week before that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What -- what did you do?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So we went on living in Dresden. My mother was eventually declared a widow, because my father was no longer regarded as being alive or -- for all intents and purposes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you -- she was not Jewish?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, she wasn't, no.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So therefore, she would have been allowed privileges.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But you would not have been allowed them, because you were --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes, but I was partly protected by my mother. I've just been going through it all again, because I'm now writing quite a few notes about the Holocaust in Germany, because the Holocaust was not only in Auschwitz and all the other places. Have you come across -- do you know German, or --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: No, I don't speak German.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: There is a -- there are some diaries by a German professor called -- it -- I'll look it up later -- who t -- who was a -- again, a Jew married to an Aryan lady and what they endured in Dresden.</p><p>Th-They -- it was from Dresden, of all places, this diary.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really? Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And he writes every day, secretly, his diary is about this period. And what they endured is just unbelievable. In the end, out of 5,000 Jews in Dresden, 60 were still alive at the end of the war.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: 5,000 Jews in Dresden, 60 alive at the end of the war.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: All the others were deported.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: All the others were deported.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Ta-Taken away.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Let me stop here. I just want to --. What was your -- what was your main fear? You hadn't made it, you didn't know whether you'd renite -- reu -- reunited with your father. What -- what were the signs around you that -- that were most frightening?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That one really had no idea what the future was going to bring. That one really lived from day to day. We lived a relatively normal life, because of my -- thanks to my mother being Aryan.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And how did she protect you? You were -- you yourself were half-Jewish, how did she protect you? Did she not discuss what you were, or did you -- did people know or what? I mean, it sounded like it was very evident.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, fortunately, as a -- | mean Jews from "41 on, had to wear the yellow star.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: The yellow star, so --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I didn't have to wear that, so --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But how did you get away with that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because, I -- as a half-Jew or half-Aryan, I didn't have to, it was only full Jews. This wh- whole crazy legislation of 100 percent and 75 percent and 50 percent. I was 50 percent and so I could not be treated like a normal human being, but on the other hand, I was not treated as a Jew.</p><p>I was sort of in-between.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What -- what did that mean for you, in terms of having friends who were Aryan, who were not Jewish.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They -- I mean, looking back on it now, I am absolutely amazed, because I mean, obviously I was, to a certain extent, probably being watched. But they -- they stayed low and treated me as -- just like a -- very good friends and so I owe a great deal to them. Then, of course, the critical time came in "44, when things were pretty desperate, sort of, in the west and in the east. And at this point, mishlings were also being called up, but not into the armed forces, but into the Tut Organization. The Tut Organization was a -- run by one of Hitler's ministers, to be engaged in emergency work, for instance, the building of the Atlantic wall and the repair of bombed railway stations, lines and all that sort of thing, in east and west. So we were not soldiers, but we were sort of -- in fact, we were regarded as second class citizens. We didn't wear a uniform, we just wore an armband which said, Tut Organization. And we were made -- made up of people with my background, political prisoners and also minor criminals. A queer mixture of people. And when was it? April "44, I said good-bye to my mother, I did not know what was going to happen to her in Dresden. Obviously we had no real contact with my father in England. I didn't know</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> </p><p> where I was going to land up, they didn't tell us, we were just loaded onto a train in Dresden and eventually we realized that we were on our way to France. And we're then sort of detailed to work on railway sites that had been bombed, to repair them -- very often, with time bombs going out -- going off at place-places. And that went on til September -- from April "44 to September "44, Mainly in the Paris area. Again, we were subject to quite a few air raids, but survived. And then there were four -- one, two, three, four of us -- five of us, I'm sorry -- who realized that one day this train would be dur -- and this was all during the allies invasion. The allies were sort of advancing, we were slowly being withdrawn and we knew that one day we would return to Germany and then of course, what was going to happen then? Especially towards the end of the war. We had no idea. So we had determined that if there was the slightest opportunity, we would jump off the train and try to find the French Resistance movement.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Could you say that a little louder, I'm sorry.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Jump off the plane?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We jumped off the train.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Train.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We would jump off the train and try and find the French Resistance Movement.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And eventually in Se -- one day in September "44, we got that opportunity as the train was being pulled back towards Germany. One evening, the five of us jumped off, disappeared in the undergrowth and found some refuge with some French farmers. And we gather that only a day or two later, the whole train was destroyed by British or American fighters. So, we were --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Why do you think the French farmers would have given you refuge, given --</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Because we were all part of the French Resistance. And we -- we had said that we -- we'd run away and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah. And they believed you?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They believed us, but day or two later, we were being arrested by the official French forces, because they thought we were German spies.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's what I was thinking.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And they didn't quite know what to do with us. We weren't soldiers. We claimed we were of Jewish origin. And so, at that time there was sort of complete chaos in France. There were refugees from various countries which had been caught up by the Germans and also run away.</p><p>And we were all taken down to the south of France to be repatriated to our various countries, but of course, they couldn't repatriate us. So we were eventually -- the Jews didn't want us, because we weren't proper Jews. So we -- there was an organization called Free Germany, which was really a -- a Communist organization, we landed up there. And we were indoctrinated to learn about Stalin and Marx and Lenin and all the rest of it. And that was not a very pleasant time and food was very short in France -- in the south of France at the time and there was no heating, terrible winter. But, eventually, I got a job with the American army. And also, about December, I mean post communications were [indecipherable] almost non-existent, but I wrote to the Bishop of Chichester -- Chichester, because that's all I knew, in very halting English, "Sir, I'm Juergen Simonson, I think you know my father. I would like to go to England and be reunited with him." And eventually he got the letter. I got a cable from him to say, "Letter received. I will put you in touch with my -- your father and I'm trying everything with the British Home Office, to get you a visa to England." That was still very difficult for a German.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Why did you pick Bishop Bell? What did you know that made you think --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because we had the occasional -- there was a Red Cross letter, that you could write every six months, with 25 or 50 words, which really said very little. In addition to that, we were extremely fortunate that we had friends in Switzerland and we could write to them and they in turn could write to my father and vice versa. So, very occasionally, we had some news through them and they had mentioned this link with the Bishop of Chichester.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And -- and Bishop Bell by this time, had -- he'd been working in the 30's -- am I correct -- with the German church, trying to --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- initially get them to speak out against Hitler.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's right, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And then once the war started, of course, their tone changed. I suppose they felt it had to, and he was much more persona non grata --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh, yes, yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- at this juncture.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And of course, he had met Dietrich Vonhuffer.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In Stockholm and I think in "42.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did he ever talk to you about Vonhuffer? [telephone ringing]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Would you like to just switch it off, please?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: [just --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- say that he didn't -- he didn't talk to you about Vonhuffer.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He didn't talk to me about Dietrich Vonhuffer. But --</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you -- he got you and [indecipherable] your father.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So he did manage to get this visa for me, and -- which took some time, but in June "45, I came over and really when I arrived at Newhaven, I felt like the Pope, I wanted to touch British so- soil. For the first time, I really felt safe again after -- what?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: All those years.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Over 10 -- 11 -- 12 -- 12 years. And met my father at Victoria and then sometime later I was introduced to George Bell. I wish I could describe --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Where was your mother? Excuse me, I'm sorry.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: She was still in England.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I'm sorry.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah, that's --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: No, you mean in Germany.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I-In Germany, that's right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was it like seeing your father after all that time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He didn't recognize me. Because he'd left me when I was a boy of 14. I was a young man of 21. We -- we'd been separated for seven years. From -- over six years, from March "39 to June "45. It was incredible. And he, in the meantime had become -- been ordained and become an Anglican priest.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="11"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, because on the one hand, I seem to remember, when I was still a boy, father was forcibly retired, we lived in Forst. There was a church outside Forst where a member of the Confessional Church --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- ministered, who later became a bishop in the German church.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: After the war.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: After the war, yes. So our links were very much with the Confessional Church. And they were really a great encouragement to us, because they were really the only organization in Germany that was left, which offered some kind of resistance to Hitler. And of course, many of their pastors were arrested and taken to concentration camps.</p></p></dialogue>

And also, of course he -- he joined the Anglican church.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And that --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Well, where had the Anglican church been in Germany during all this? Where --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, I mean they were just colonial churches, which catered for the English people --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: The English -- the English speaking people in Germany.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: That's right, that's --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: The English were there.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, there were not -- in other words, there were no Anglican churches in Germany that were German?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, of course, I mean they just did their job of looking after the -- their English nationals.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, that's right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And the Anglican church in [indecipherable] must have come to an end, probably.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, yeah. So that was -- that was your tradition. Now, you met George Bell later, is that right?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I met him later, quite a number of times.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What do you remember about him?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: The most -- I wish I could describe him. The only thing I can describe about him -- that he had the most translucent blue eyes that ve ever seen. You really saw through him -- through the eyes, into his soul. A very fine face. A man who'd obviously stood up and been rejected himself, as you probably know. I mean he -- you probably wouldn't --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Well, I don't know -- perhaps you could tell us. I know that the bishop -- Bishop Hedlum, I believe was the Bishop of Gloucester, is that right?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, that's right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I know that Hedlum had written to the Archbishop about Bell and thinking Bell should keep quiet, because he was so vociferous against --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> <span class="page-break" number="14"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- what Hitler was doing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But I don't know, other than Hedlum, I had a feeling that perhaps Bell was very supported by the British church an-and -- wh-what what was your -- you tell me what you know. I don't know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It's more that he spoke up very strongly in the House of Lords, against the bombing of German cities.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And so he was considered a pacifist --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And so --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- or was he just considered a person who should not have --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Who should not have -- have spoken up --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- took a -- took a position that --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And Churchill obviously didn't take kindly to him. I mean, there's no doubt, I think, nowadays that when Lang retired, that Bell --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Archbishop Lang, we're talking about --.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- would have -- would have -- yes, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- the Archbishop of Canterbury. Yes. And that year was what?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I think it would have -- most probably "42 --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Two.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- that Bell would have become Archbishop of Canterbury, because he was the outstanding ecumenical figure of his time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="15"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In his place, Temple was made archbishop -- who also made an outstanding archbishop. I mean both of them are -- were outstanding figures. Sorry -- no, I've got it wrong. It's the other way around. Temple was made archbishop in "42.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes, that's right, that's right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: But sadly died in "44, which was a great tragedy. From -- I can't remember now what his illness was. And --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So he didn't live to the end of the war?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. And in his place, Bell should have been made archbishop.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, I see. Bell shouldn't have succeeded Lang.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: He should have succeeded Temple.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Temple, that's right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And -- and who did succeed Temple, do you remember?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, it would have been Fisher, I think.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Is that right?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So Bell --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Remained Bishop of Chichester and played a very important role in the ecumenical scene.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: In what way? Do you know [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, he was -- he was one of the -- became one of the chairman of the Royal Council of Churches. And was re -- lauseal sponsor for the first assembly of the Royal Council of Churches  <span class="page-break" number="16"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> in Amsterdam in 1948, when, for the first time, all the churches were able to come together again. He also made visits to Germany and welcomed German church leaders to England and sort of reestablished the contact between the --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: With the German church.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: With the German church.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Which must have been difficult, because he had been so close to them at one time --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Mm, that's right, yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- and then -- there's a -- a letter in Andrew Chandler's book about -- I believe it's Bell writing to Carl Bart and expressing such surprise that Neimuller, from prison, had offered to command another U-boat. Do you remember that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And -- and he writes to Bart and says, "How could Neimuller have even remotely suggested that he would fight in a war for people with whom he differed on every level?"</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: know, that's right. Mm, that's right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And Bart wrote back to Bell and said, "Neimuller is too much of a German --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- and too much of a Lutheran."</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, that's an interesting statement.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's right, yes, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How would you interpret Bart's comment back to Bell?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: That's -- Neimuller was -- I suppose, deep down his heart, a patriot, and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Mm-hm. And that -- that -- that superseded the moral sense of what was happening?</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="17"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Must have done. That's right. And also, of course, there was a terrible -- I mean this is -- was one of the reasons and I read this again now -- terrible fear in Germany that the Russians, the Bolshevists as they were called, would overrun Germany. And they would rather be under Hitler, a -- a --a German Nazi, then under a Russian Bolshevists.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, of course, this is the argument that the church used all the time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Hm. That's right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And the church of -- of -- I mean, both Protestant and Roman Catholic. Certainly that was much of what I think generated the lack of support from Pius the -- the 12th.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Hm. That's right, oh yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was that -- that fear.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yes, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And -- and because there were some people who were Jewish who were Communists, that was, of course, something that was always ascribed to the Jews, that --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah, that's all true, yes. Oh, that's right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- that so often as a -- and then created some antagonism there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was your -- were -- when you met Bell, in later years, did he ever talk about his difficulties in the 30's?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, di-didn't talk to me, because I was a -- a junior. I really met him partly because I was -- at that time -- looking for a job.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's all right. I want to know where we are. I want to -- I'm going to stop this right -- excuse me, tell me -- finish by what you were saying. You were looking for a?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And so was seeking his advice.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. Let me just.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- silence and then we're just discussing more general things, less the exact events, chronological events than some thoughts and opinions, then we'll get back to some chronological events perhaps, too. I was just asking Mr. Simonson, who's the Reverend Mr. Simonson, how he felt about the Goldhagen book and how that jibes with his own memories of Germany and -- and -- and what were you saying? It was a bit of revelation to you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: It was really quite a shock to me, because in the wer -- I mean, he comes to the conclusion that really the whole German people are responsible for what happened and I'm just reflecting on this and putting some of these thoughts on paper. And really, other -- I find very difficult, because some of my school friends have been very loyal to me and have stood by me. But they were, of course, involved in the war. And --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: This is your mother's family, though, too. I mean, this is your background, also.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yes, that's right, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you -- did you sense that growing up? Was your mother's family ever voicing anything that was that -- were they upset with your mother for marrying someone Jewish?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Strangely not, because I think they very much respected my father. And -- I mean they must have been in -- in a great conflict. | wonder what went on in their minds about this.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did your mother ever talk about it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not really, no, no. In fact they said very little after the war. I don't think they -- they could talk about it, was too difficult a subject.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But --</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="20"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, were there -- let me phrase it differently, then. When you were in Dresden, you had people who stood by you, who were kind to you, who were good to you. Were there those who were like the people in the forest, also?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Not so much in Dresden, because we moved in a fairly small circle and they were all people who stood by us. So we -- which to some extent sheltered and protected. But you always -- of course you always lived in fear, that -- I mean tha -- this is the awful thing that comes through in these diaries by Klemperer, that every day they lived in fear that the Gestapo would knock on the door and call and either beat them or take them away. So one had this sort of --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did you ever see that?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, the only thing I do remember was in the -- after the Kristallnacht --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: 1938, November.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: 1938, when Jews were driven through the main street, the Praggerstrasser in Dresden, on their way to the station to be taken to the concentration camps.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you actually saw people hoarded?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I saw it, yes. And also I -- on the morning after the -- the synagogue was burned down --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: In Dresden?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I cycled past the synagogue and saw the -- just the sort of remains of it, like.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you wonder about whether you might have been caught up in that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Not so much about myself, but I knew that my father would have been caught up in it and I w -- but --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But you must have had Jewish friends in Dresden, did you not? Or did you not?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Very -- well, very few. No, most of my friends were -- you see, we really -- my father was a Christian, was brought up as a Christian.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="21"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So was I.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And we had very few links with the -- the Jewish community. I mean I'm absolutely shocked now, to read these diaries of a man who lived not very far away from me and I knew nothing of what went on in those circles. And all these hundreds of people who were deported. The only thing that I do know, which sort of affects us more immediately, was that affe -- concerns my grandparents. My -- my father's father had been one of the senior judges of the central court in Leipzig in the central German court in Leipzig. And so they lived in Leipzig, fairly comfortably, because he had a fairly senior post. Then, eventually, again, I only discovered this the other day, they moved from Leipzig to Dresden -- to Berlin, because Leipzig was declared Judenfrie -- free of Jews. So they had to be -- clear out. And they had to move into rented accommodation in Berlin, which was allocated to them. And mercifully, my grandfather died there in "42. Now, with them lived my aunt, my father's sister, who was single, who'd always lived at home. And several times before "39, I think my father had also tried to bring her out to England. And she hesitated, because she couldn't bring herself to leave her parents. And so she was left behind.</p><p>And in -- I've only just had all the f-file from Berlin, my aunt -- eventually they just lived in two rooms in Berlin. My aunt went to the t -- some office to collect her rations for the month, for Jews. They were treated as Jews, they had to wear the yellow star, of course. And was told that -- to get herself ready to be deported the following day. And my grandmother who was then 83 or 84, could not -- could not bear the thought of being left behind, so she decided to go with her daughter to Theresienstadt. Does that name mean anything?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Of course.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="22"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Which of course was for the more privileged Jews.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And -- I mean she would have been deported anyway, later on. And what I found in these papers -- this were -- this was all about the disposal of their property and their possessions, because everything went -- went back automatically to the state.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And what particular branch of the state would have taken that? The Department of Treasury, Commerce, do you know?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Finance.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Department of Finance.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: But, through the auspices of the Gestapo. I mean th-that was really --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So Himmler's --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes. And so, in March "43, they went to Theresienstadt and I think my grandmother must have died fairly soon after that. And I've written now -- it's extraordinary that all this has taken so long. I've written now to Theresien -- to -- no, to -- to an agency in Prague. They can't trace my grandmother at all. They've given me another address, which I haven't tried yet. Whether there's still any -- I mean -- whether anyone knows where she was cremated --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And your father wouldn't have known any of this --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, no, no, no --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- because he was in England.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not til after the war. And then my aunt was later on deported. Moved on to Auschwitz and probably gassed immediately.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you don't know what happened when they -- either of them were killed?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no, no.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="23"></span> </p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So you went --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Su --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- when did you find this out? In "45?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, we -- no, what happened was that my other aunt in Dresden, my father's sister, wa-was also married to an Aryan and she was allowed to send monthly food parcels to my grandmother in Theresienstadt. And I -- again -- only discovered this now, that all they were allowed to write back by way of n -- acknowledgment, was a printed card which said, "Parcel received, we are well." They were not allowed to add any other information. And once that information -- that acknowledgment stopped, we knew that they had gone.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So probably after a few months, the -- these -- she must have died and my aunt was then moved on to Auschwitz. The awful thing was that in one of these papers from Berlin, I found that the official document says they were -- my grandmother and my aunt were aukershoben, which simply means -- it's -- it's a word that you use for cattle transports. They were just shoved  <span class="page-break" number="24"></span> </p><p> away. I mean that's how people treated them. That's how they were looked at. Not as human beings.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When did your father find out?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, immediately after the war.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right after the war he found out what happened to his mother and his sister?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It's unbelievable, isn't it? What -- what a -- a funny sense it must have given you, of having been able to survive, when your own family was dying. It's a hard thing to deal with too, isn't it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: That's right, yes, yes. And again I've only just sort of realized that had my father not found this diplomat as a sponsor, he probably wouldn't have been able to go. He would have had the yellow star and what happened to all the other Jews, he would have been deported eventually.</p><p>And we would have all moved into -- after some time, all the Jews were moved into Jewish quarters, where the Gestapo could kee-keep a close -- watch them. And -- so we would have been --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: This in -- this in Dresden?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In Dresden, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In Dresden.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So we would have had to move into Jewish quarters.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So there was a ghetto there also?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, that's right, yes. And so my father probably would have been -- and I wouldn't have had the same protection. And also, after -- from "42 on, I -- as a mishling now, would no longer be allowed to go to a German school. I was extremely lucky, really.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It's a miracle.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="25"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And also that I came through all the forced labor in France, and so --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: What did you do in the forced labor? You -- you talked a little bit about it earlier.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can you tell me anything about what that was?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, we were working on railway stations, just sort of --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Physically building?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, exhuming. Quite a lot of trains were hit by these bombs and German soldiers were sort of covered by the debris and we had to exhume them and take them to the local cemetery to in-inter them and then reinstate the railway stations, that the trains could run through, the convoys to the front. And very often in areas infested by the French resistance movement. So, on the one hand, we had the bombs raining down from the allied forces. We were under the Nazis, who kept a close eye on -- on us and we were also threatened by the French resistance movement, because they saw us as being on the [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Saw you as the enemy of, course.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It's interesting how much of your life you spent being two different things.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, that's right. Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Goodness. You got to England --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You -- you met Bell.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- so you would not have met him.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: B-But you -- and Temple was gone, really, by the time you got here, too, wasn't he?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So yeah, so he was -- so they would not have played a role.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No. Bell --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Bell --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- was m -- our great hero and my father owed really everything to him.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Because --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Tell me what your father said about him. Do you remember?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, you can read it in his book. He's --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: In -- in your father's book --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes, yes. He's written a book about it. [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Your fa -- I did -- I didn't know that.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No. Andrew didn't tell me that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Is there any way I can get a co -- another copy of that book?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I can lend it to you, if you want to.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I'll -- Pll send it back, but I'd feel better if I could buy one. You don't think I can purchase one?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no, that's out -- out of print. Completely out of print.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="27"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, I'd hate to take yours.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, there's a --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: We'll talk about that later.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. Okay, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But your father's memories of Bell, he's -- he -- he saved his life, did he -- did he -- perhaps this is the question. Why was Bell what Bell was? Does anybody know? He never talked about it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no. No idea.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I mean Bell was -- was so rare in his concern for the Jews.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Mm, oh yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You don't -- among Christian clergy anywhere. Here -- James Parks, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, that's right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But Bell, at a time when the best of the clergy would say, "Well, it's terrible what's happening to the Jews, but --"</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Iknow.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: "-- we don't really like them, so it's easy to understand."</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: That's right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You had a Bell, who wasn't saying any of those things, he was saying we care for these people, we want to help them. But you don't know why?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I wonder if Bell ever wrote anything about his feelings at all. Do you remember your father mentioning if -- Bell writing at all?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="28"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: [indecipherable] his letters, it -- it comes through --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- so clearly. Interesting. So --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, father had very close -- I mean, I've got quite a bit of correspondence from Bell upstairs.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I hope you --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh, I treasure it.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Treasure that, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, yes, yes, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And the -- oh, I'll talk about that later. When you -- when you were with Bell, did he ask you about your years in Germany? Was he interested in --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh, of course, yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Very much.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And -- and what could he do after the war? Or let me go back to what he did during the war.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>We know he went to the House of Lords.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did Bell also go to Parliament to speak at all?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, as a bishop, you could only go the House of Lords.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You could only go the House of -- of the Lords.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: All right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="29"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: But --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And -- and -- was there -- what was the reception? I mean the bombing, we know the bombing --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- of Dresden and -- and the -- I mean the bombing of the big cities --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: That's right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- people were not happy with him. When he went, did he -- did he not plea -- make a plea for refugees, though, too?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, but again, I'm amazed -- I've just been reading another book, by a -- actually a Polish lady, who then lived in Berlin and then became refugee and came to England. And is now married to one of the labor lords. And she speaks very disparagingly of the British leadership as being anti-Semitic.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Mm. And of course, several instances where, to her -- I mean she is very outspoken and I'm not sure whether I can trust her judgment, but she believes that there was a great deal of an-anti- Semi -- and that even England could have done much more and let in more refugees.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: To what degree do you think that the -- the teachings are what -- Jules Ithzak of course has coined that phrase that is used so much, teaching of contempt, the 2,000 year history of -- of saying that the Jews were responsible for the death of Jesus, that the Jews were a -- a group that had been really disowned by God, that the covenant had been passed on, the mantle had been passed on to Christianity.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Mm, that's right.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="30"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And that degenerate religion and -- and all of those things that -- that were so much a part of our Sunday school teaching, our church teaching.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: How much do you think the anti-Judaism played into the anti-Semitism of the church here, the church in Germany -- what -- do you -- you probably don't have much sense, because you weren't involved with the church --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- in Germany at that time, but -- but picking it up here then, let's look at it in England.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, even -- I mean, looking back on it, I -- both in Germany and here, I'm sure it hurt quite a lot to --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Quite a lot of impact.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I think so, yes. And --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Do you ever meet with clergy from Germany? Did you, in -- in those early years, when you were here and -- and did your father have contact with clergy in Germany and -- after the war, much?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He -- some of them, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And -- and, you remember your father talking about there was reaction to the Jewish people [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, I we -- unfortunately he's dead now. I wish I could ask him all these questions now.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. Of course you do.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Too late.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Too late.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="31"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You and your work. Tell me a little bit about what you did after the war, when you came here and before you became a clergyman yourself. What -- what -- what prompted you to go into ministry?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because of the experiences a-at the end, i-i -- during the forced labor.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Would you explain that a little bit?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Lespecially -- as I told you, I was down in the south of France, working for the American army. And one day a British padre who was a -- a chaplain in the forces, who was also a friend of my father's, they'd been in theological college together -- appeared and said he was also looking after a big, German prisoner of war camp, down in the south of France and didn't have the language. Could I come and help him? And, of course, I'd never done anything like it, before. And so I preached my first sermon in a German prisoner of war camp.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Now, are you saying you preached, but you weren't ordained --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, no.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- at this time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no, no.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So what --how did that come about?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: He just picked me up and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And said, "I want you to preach"?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's right, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, what did you preach on, do you remember?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I preached -- when you're confirmed in Germany, which is a lovely custom, you're given a verse subscripter to -- as a sort of motto for your life.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And what was yours?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="32"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And my pastor, who obviously knew about my circumstances, gave me John, chapter six, verse 68, "Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life." And that time I did not know where I was going to go.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Going, yeah. Isn't that amazing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And that was really the only verse I knew. So I preached on that. And of course that was true of the German POW's as well. They were in total chaos. They had no contact with their families at home. Their cities had been bombed at home. They were defeated and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: We don't think much about the young German boys --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, that's right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- who were lost or who were suffering so much.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Mm, that's right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Caught -- conscripted and caught up in a war they didn't understand and didn't have any responsibility for --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Mm, that's right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- and had no choice and -- and well, we frankly hated them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh yes, oh yes, yes</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Was a -- that was the enemy, and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Mm, that's right, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And -- and because of what happened with the Gypsies and the handicapped and the Jews and many groups, we focus so much on them, we do forget how much suffering --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And of course it was the second time this had happened in a major scale, so --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Mm, that's right. Oh, yes, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> <span class="page-break" number="33"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- find it hard to be so -- I'm sure a voice such as yours would have been a very welcome one for them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: So that was really the beginning, that I had sort of began to feel perhaps that --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: That you were called.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Mm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Then you were in England. What did you do, originally, when you got there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, then I had to do -- immediately after the war, I was the first enemy alien to arrive in Britain.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. Mm-hm. Thanks to Bell.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Bishop Bell, right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Mm-hm, that's right. In June "45. Only, oh, less than a month from the end of the war in Europe and I had to do some import -- I mean some essential work, so I worked for the -- really some clerical work, a filing clerk in London for a time. Partly also, because I had to retake my matric, because the German matric wasn't valid. So I had to take a sort of equivalent. And also really more -- to become more fluent in English. And then in "48, I went to theological college.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Where?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And was again --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Where -- where [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: In -- near London. In Surrey. And was ordained in "52. And my college principal later became Archbishop of Canterbury, Donald Coggin. And --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah. And where was your first assignment?</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="34"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: First in -- in London, really in a very tough area, 40,000 people in Paddington. And then we wondered whether we should go abroad and serve the church overseas. So we were in Nigeria for seven years, in the theological college, teaching.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Good heavens.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And then came back to England and I was in two parishes in south London.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: N-Now, were you there until you retired?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you have any contact with any Jewish Christian organizations, any organizations of ecumenical nature?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you have any interest in them?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Probably -- probably not at the time, because I was so involved in my own work.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I've only really so -- I'm catching up now.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I wonder if that's -- I'm meeting tomorrow with somebody from that group, with -- with Dorothy, I'm having lunch with --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, down in Southhampton?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yes, I don't know who it is. She says there's a new -- maybe it's just in Southhampton --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: It's a new [indecipherable] that's right. That -- that I belong to.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I'm going to have lunch then. So this is a late -- a late in life interest?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes, yes</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You've got your father's papers, some of them?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did your father write any memoir -- he wrote about Bell.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Bell certainly must feature in his book very much, yes, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I-PIl show it to you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But his own experiences, he didn't write much?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: He did?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: There's his whole -- his whole story.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Pl give it to you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And -- and looking at it today, what would you say about the state of Jewish Christian relations here? Is there a lot of interest and -- for example, the liturgy -- on -- on Good Friday, that whole Holy Week liturgy is so riddled with Johanine text --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: [know. That's right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That make us so uncomfortable --  <span class="page-break" number="36"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- and we're really working to do something about the reading of those texts, perhaps selecting others, in America. Is that true of England, or is there not much of a movement in that area?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not a great deal I would have thought. And also I would have thought, there must be still quite a lot of latent anti-Semitism about.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Anti-Semitism. Uh-huh. Must be strange --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I think if I looked into the hearts of my neighbors here, who are very much establishment and conservative, I think, deep down in their hearts -- I mean they wouldn't express it to me, because they respect me for what I am.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Sure.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But I think deep down in their hearts, probably, it would be still there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I would think that would be very upsetting.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes, but I mean it's -- it's --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You live with it.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- such a long history, isn't it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It's a long history. It's a long history.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You can't sort of suddenly snap out of it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Hm. We've had a long time to try and snap out of it, though</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Hm.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What -- what does this -- the Christian and Jewish organization do to work on this, do you know? I mean, you just joined it, so you probably don't know a great deal about what they're doing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="37"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes. No, and also I think that it's only a special interest for some people and it doesn't really penetrate into the heart and soul of --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah, yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- the majority.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Would you think that the -- I mean one of the questions that one has to ask, really, is -- is it possible to rid Christianity of this anti-Judaism?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I mean, is it? Is it something we're just going to always have to --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Mm.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- say is part of us, and if so, is that -- does that -- seems to me the church never lived up to the ideals it set for itself during that period and -- and I -- I -- if we can't do something to foster a change, then -- then we've really got a -- a bit of a crippled tradition here.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Mm. Oh yes. But I mean, in the first place, what do you do with the gospels?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, that's a problem.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. What do you do about, St. John?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Well, of course, what I do, is I don't preach from St. John --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- and I don't read St. John --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- I read the -- the others and -- and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, but -- that's right -- but I mean --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Or I -- or I put it in it's te -- context though --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, that's right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> <span class="page-break" number="38"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- I think that's what you have to ask clergy to do.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, yes. So I think depends very much on the way it's being interpreted by the church today.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And I suppose that really, then, to me, is what the crux of it all was about, that -- that we need to get into our seminaries --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Mm, that's right. Here, here.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- and teach students how to understand those texts.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's right, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: In the sitsinlabin and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Mm, that's right, yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- and that's the only thing that's going to help us in our preaching, is if clergy trained in the future and I guess my question then is -- this is being done in some seminaries in the United States, the Roman Catholic Church is doing it, but do you think it's being done in this country in the seminaries today?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I would doubt it, on the whole. I don't think it plays a very important --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I mean that's a -- tho -- there are three -- now four conciliar documents of the Roman Catholic church that have called for this. So, that has quite an imprimatur.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Mm, mm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And -- and sends a very strong message to the Catholic seminaries -- and I'm a product of a Catholic seminary. But I -- it distresses me as a Protestant, that I don't think this is as much a concern in our country --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, no.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- in the Protestant seminaries. But if I hear you correctly, you're saying it's not really one here.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="39"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't think that's the way in Britain, I -- certainly not as far as I know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think I would have picked it up.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: When you talk --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I mean what --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Please --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- in-interests me is that now, after 50 years, people are only beginning to address the Holocaust.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I mean in the churches.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's right, that's right, that's right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I mean the Pope maping -- making this announcement only a few weeks ago.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The French church, last year I think.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Beautiful statement of the French bishop's, isn't it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [know. Yes, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you have a copy of that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. Mm. The various other things which only -- why has it taken us all this time to face up to it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I think that's the question. And I think that's the question we need to keep asking.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. What about your fellow clergy? What do you hear from them, anything? Do they -- do you ever discuss it with them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="40"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Who comprises the -- this council of Christians and Jews here? Is it clergy, is it hum -- just --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, it's --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- regular lay people?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, it's -- it's clergy and laity.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Obviously some very good people, but only -- it's only very small number of people, a tiny minority who are anxious to foster good relationships.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. Well, it's -- that must be a disappointment for you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I mean, one who has played an important role is my former principal, who then became Archb -- Canterbury, Donald Coggin, who has been one of the presidents of the Council of Christian and Jews.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm. And that's a -- that's a nice feeling, isn't it -- to have it be that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Hm, that's right, yes. And as -- as you probably know, Stoneberg has just received the Templeton prize.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, yeah [inaudible] that. Well, as you look back on those years, knowing now what you know about the church -- I mean one of the things you would not have been probably thinking about so much when you decided to take this route, you wouldn't have been looking in depth at the role of the church at that time, you were looking at what it said -- what it meant to you and how it helped you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And how you felt it could help others.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="41"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What -- and you have no contact with German clergy today, do you, really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not directly, no -- no.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you don't really know what they're -- what the teaching and preaching is from the seminar -- did you ever hear much about Marberg and Tubing and -- I mean, when the Aryan clause came in in -- in "33, it looks as if there was the acquiescence of all the seminaries, except Marberg seemed to be the one that held a little bit to it's belief.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I didn't know that, hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But y -- that was not an iss -- you never discussed these kinds of things?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no, no, no.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: This was not part of your life, was it, at all?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, no -- you see, I was only a young boy, really, when --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You were so young, of course, of course. This was not --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- when [indecipherable] me. So again, I'm only just catching up on things that I should have known long time ago.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Let me go back to your mother. Your mother joined your father in what year?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: "45.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So each had learned to live --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And she had -- again -- been through the terrible destruction of Ger -- of Dresden. Lost everything [inaudible]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Run for 12 days through the countryside, to --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I'm sorry, say that again. She ran for 12 days through the --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Through the countryside --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Countryside.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- to find somewhere to -- where she could find refuge.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Then she was under the -- in the Russian zone. Tried to escape twice with her parents into west Germany and failed. And then partly through Probst Grueber, of whom you may have heard, he was -- he did [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Could you spell that name?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: G-r-u-e-b-e-r. Probst -- Probst was a German -- he was a senior German clergyman in Berlin.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Grueber.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I'm sorry. Yes, of course, of course. Well, tell me, go on.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And he was instrumental in getting my mother out of the Russian zone to Berlin, into the western zone.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Pastor Grueber.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="43"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes. That was one of the great names, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And of course he worked very closely with Bell.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes, yes. One of the real shining lights in the church.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's right, yes, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, how did he get your mother out exactly, though, do you know?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I suppose my mother must have sort of appealed to him or written to him and asked for his help.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Or no, again, I'm sure this came through Bell.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Bell --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So you think Bell got in touch with him?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- got in touch with Grueber. "Could you please do something for this lady?"</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yes, yes. Was he doing this with lots of people, do you know?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. Oh, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you know what happened to him?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I -- I -- I'm not sure, no. No, I don't think I can tell you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah, well I just wondered what the -- what the post-war experience --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I mean, there would be something about Grueber in my father's book, probably. [inaudible]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In your father's book, yeah. There wo -- wo -- the -- your mother got here, what -- what was life for her then like? Did she speak much English?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No, I wouldn't think she would.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="44"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: She -- she was very German and found quite difficult to -- and of course she hadn't married a clergyman.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's right. She married a judge.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: That's right, yes. And suddenly she found herself the wife of a clergyman. So she found it quite -- quite difficult. And she was a -- there's a picture of her, under the [inaudible]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Pll have to go look at that, yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Un-under this.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And she probably felt some hostility, did she not? Because she was German? Maybe not.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I think she was so delighted to be reunited with my father and with me. And for all three of us to come together again, I mean --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- it was a miracle. It was an absolute miracle.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, it was a miracle. And the fact th-that there were English who didn't like the Germans would not have been the issue here.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: The issue was that she was so finally --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: That's right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- back together. And -- and your father retired when?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Father retired at the age of 75. He was the vicar in Hampstead, in London.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was he?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And then he lived til he -- another 25 years and died at the age of hundred -- 101.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Your father died at the age of 101? And how long did your mother live?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: She died a little earlier, she was 88.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="45"></span> </p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, yes, yes. But I mean, considering what they'd been through, it's amazing that they lasted so long.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It's absolutely extraordinary. Just extraordinary.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Mm, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: What a -- what an amazing thing.
