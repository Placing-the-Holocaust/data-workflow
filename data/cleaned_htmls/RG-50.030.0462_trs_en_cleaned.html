So, we'll see whether -- cause I went through all of our conversations, so I have some small questions, and I have some larger questions. So, here's my first question, okay? You said, when you disembarked, when you got to Auschwitz, you disembarked in the town of Oswiecim.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Correct. Out -- outside of Stohn, I would say, it's very -- very -- very ofsa town, compared like New York, and maybe Welfare Island. Yeah, a little bit. Just close enough, but outside of the center of the -- of the town, yeah. There wasn't all -- actually, now, after 50 years, I can even show you a map which we have produced, together with the Auschwitz Museum.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Now, in Europe, people -- as the railway stations in Europe are small, because they have the railway stations in -- for little cities, and larger cities, concentrated mainly for people. And everything else is a little bit far out. It stops before the -- before the general railway station, so I would say a couple of miles.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Couple of miles.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Friday afternoon, Saturday -- Friday night, Saturday, then it must have been Saturday night, and over to Sunday. And that -- what it -- what it peared -- appeared to me then, I even mentioned that in the borders -- borders interview. Today, after 50 years, somehow it is -- it was shrinking in my mind of one day, one night, and another day, yeah. But I don't remember certain night any more, yeah, today. But I d-definitely remember one night. So, that's how it goes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember the mood that you had on the train?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Pardon?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: There was no mood. Fif -- you know, fi -- we have been one week in -- on stage of isolation in [indecipherable] point, which was cold, but dronga, on the old factory hall. And wi -- we had enough to eat, because everybody who was there brought some food along from home, so that we were living on. They did not supplied us any food. You are not asking an important question, but the people somehow managed to -- everybody had something from home, yeah, and somehow that was our -- that kept us somehow in a mood, yeah, if you are talking about mood. I don't even remember, there was nothing to drink. I don't remember anything to drink, and we went probably the whole week, nothing to drink.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: From the time you --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- got into Petronka until --</p></p></dialogue>

There was no food distribution. That means whatever we had, maybe some fruit or so, replaced the -- some water, and it was -- there was no mood, it was some very strange situation, because we were -- we -- we have never experienced anything like that. We went as young people to -- to summer camps as children, and as teenagers. We -- they were -- we were told we have to -- we will go and do some work in the fields, or whatever necessary, because there's no -- not enough manpower, or woman power, or whatever power, work. There -- there is not enough of -- there are not enough of people for certain jobs available, because everybody's -- the male are on the front, and the women in that -- to work in factories, so do other things, the civilians. So we were actually selected to do jobs wherever we need it -- wherever we are needed, yeah. So, nobody was com -- very excited. The war went on, and so what? But for weeks or months we'll survive and come back home, that what we are told.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: So there was not a -- really no -- no mood. Just we have taken things [indecipherable], we -- we realize that something must be done, and that is what they want us to do, to do some odd jobs, and [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So there was no suspicion about something terrible --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- going to happen? Nothing?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Not at all, not at all. The only people who knew about the terrible things which are in front of us, were -- was the Jewish community's board of -- the so-called Jewish centers, the Juden Centrales, they knew that things aren't going too good for us. But they never disclosed anything.</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> But I know we know that they knew, after the Wannsee Conference, yeah, what is in front of -- what's in front of the population [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right. And you think they knew?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They knew.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: They knew?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: They knew. They didn't know about the gas chambers. They didn't know about the real f -- that -- that factory, because they knew that it doesn't look good for us, but they couldn't --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- they said they really didn't know. Because when the first people escaped from Auschwitz, those four boys, you know, Wirbra, Vetsla, Mordavich, and Rossi, and when they returned, to report, you wouldn't believe it. All Jewish people --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Don't do that.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- wouldn't believe. So, that's why I know and suspect that, you know, they didn't know the real techniques of Germans [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But when you -- by the time you got on the train --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- to go to Auschwitz, you must have been weak, all of you. Were you weak?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Weak?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Weak?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You weren't?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Cattle car train.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Sitting on the floor.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Floor. And did they pack you in, or was it not so bad?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It wasn't nice.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It wasn't nice, but even that, we couldn't -- so we were only young girls, you see. The other -- other people went with families, husbands and children.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right, right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We were young people, couldn't care less. Even if it was only with [indecipherable] for to work, but not youngsters -- very similar to those f-festivals we had, where the youngsters were squeezed together, and were happy and singing, yeah?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Th-though we were not singing, and we were squeezed together, yeah, but it [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did people get beaten?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Huh?</p><p>This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were people beaten, were you treated brutally, or not?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, no, no, they were very careful, very careful not to -- not to s -- give us any feeling of -- to become suspicious. No, we were just left alone, I would say. There were no guards inside. Yeah, they left us alone. No screamings, and no -- no beatings, nothing. So first real rough situation occurred when we arrived in Auschwitz itself. Because before, on the trip we were -- I think that was an combined -- combined operation between the guards of the Slovakians, and the Germans.</p><p>The Slovaks took us to the border, and after the border, the Ger -- the bor -- not the border, it's in Poland already, so Germans, they took over. But -- so, disembarking went very rough, yeah. Un - - un -- unexplainable rough. Obvious different types of people, different uniforms, different commands, everything changed, and then we still didn't know what it is all about. So, it took us a couple of days to get used, while arriving in Auschwitz, and th -- we went through the procedure, in the first couple of days. So, that taught us gradually, that life -- the prior life of ours, is behind us, yeah. And --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did you --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- we have entered a new world.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you understand German then? Did you know -- you knew German.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: The girls -- as most of the girls were from our capital city, where -- which is an German speaking city, among others. It's ambu -- multilingual city. But most of the Germ -- of the Jewish girls, of course, went to German elementary schools. If nothing else, they went to elementary schools, because the German elem-elementary schools -- the Jewish element-elementary schools were German --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- in those days, it was shortly after World War Two, the people were born, the G-Germans --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You mean World War One, they were born shortly after --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: World War One, correct, sorry. Th-Those girls were born, the parents enrolled them in Jewish elementary schools because they were good. They s -- have just transferred that from the Austrian system into the Slovak system. So that -- you must realize people, like Jewish parents, always prefer to send their kids to good schools, yeah. They have preferred the German, because that wa -- the elementary schools had the teachers, the language -- I mean the system was already established, while the Slovak system had to be established. There was not even a Slovak grammatic. It has to be developed in those days. But we spoke all -- we had to speak Slovak, and the city had a large Hungarian population from the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, but the Jewish people never -- ne -- in our city, Bratislava, never had any -- that -- they preferred the German.</p><p>The Hungarian was mainly in the hands of non-Jews, yeah. It was the old fa-fashioned m- monarchies, yeah. We had none -- nothing in -- in our community like that. So --</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes?</p></p></dialogue>

I put that on, and not knowing -- I knew that we are not going into a city, but maybe into the fields, or other [indecipherable] rural areas. So I accordingly dressed myself, and shoes were always of importance wherever you went, even -- I mean, those shoes, I took the best and most durable, strong shoes I had. And as a matter of fact, I have a picture of those shoes [indecipherable]. So, what else? And I had on good winter coat, a wool winter coat. I -- and I had gloves, and on cover of a knitted angora -- kind of an turban, something what we wear today, knitted, very nice, in dark green, I don't know if -- in bottle green, I never forget that.

No more, and no less.</p><p>I have never -- and that was -- I could not share that with anybody because those girls didn't know what it is all about. I had experience with ex-German Jews, who were leaving, and Austrian Jews who left, all immigrants from all parts of Europe, they were coming through our city for awhile, and then left again.

So, I knew that I entered an concentration camp, in spite of the fact that we really went through the door which said [indecipherable] fry. There were the stop signs, hahlt, yeah. All kinds of -- of warning signs, and important to the whole entrance of the camp, which even today I think you can see. But that little sign of concentration camp, was there, I don't know why, it must have been there for the -- to the rules, yeah, or to international rules. It was there, and I noticed it.

My very first contact in co -- it's very strange. My very first contact with somebody whom I haven't known before, and somehow drove -- drove us close to each other, was Katya, who became then the top administrative inmate of the women's camp. Katya Singr, now how -- what happened? While we were still laying on the straw, on the floor in that factory hall the first day, she's -- had an very deep voice, and that woman started to cry, and to scream loud, and crying, and crying --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: This isn't --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- like an bad baby, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>

I went over to her, just ask her to stop to cry, we are all in the same boat, yeah. And she has no right to scream, and to cry, and to -- it will not help. And I was sitting next to her, and she stopped crying. So we became friends. I was the only person who spoke to her, and so then, we shared our belongings, the food, until we were put into the cattle car. She was in the same cattle car, we stick together somehow, as close as we could, because I felt I can in-influence her in making her a little bit more comforta -- feel comfortable, and she needed something like that,</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

<dialogue class=""><p>In -- but, then I had an accident, a -- a whole chimney -- while we were demolishing houses outdoors, an old chimney was falling on my back, and I felt very bad, and I had enough. So I approached somebody in charge of work detail, of the -- the -- one of the women of Ravensbriick, an German political prisoner, to help me to stay indoors, and if she could, arrange something. If somebody would believe that [indecipherable] and that's my profession. And -- because I still didn't wanted to stay with Katya, yeah. I didn't wanted to become a blockelteste, it's too [indecipherable] or whatever. I simply had no desire.

The very first time, so they had no idea how to go about, and were trying to leave everything to the ex -- to the prisoners from Ravensbriick, who were specially brought over to Auschwitz to help to organize, because they had experience, while spending many years prior to that transf -- transfer to Auschwitz, in Ravensbriick. But even they were not trained, or prepared for such mass influx of prisoners. So they depended practically on whatever we created there by ourselves.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: If people were -- and -- and the prisoners who became, or who wanted to be in charge, they had no experience of handling people, or the -- not at schools, they were not teachers, there were no -- so they're just ordinary house girls, yeah. Never with an -- hardly professionals. Some of them had training in -- in office work, yeah. They succeeded because eventually the SS started to organize, together with the prisoners. I mean, food -- food had to be distributed. They didn't know how to go about that. So they had to learn how to distribute food, they had to learn by -- by experience, day by day, how to go about everything. So, it was not easy, it was in horrible chaos for weeks, and weeks, and weeks. And eventually, after months, when the relocation of the women, in August "44 -- no, "42, occurred, th-the relocation to Birkenau, it was still cow -- chaotic, but people were already used to it. Roll call was -- lasted hours. The SS was never trained, they were not very intelligent people. Very simple, primitive people, and they s -- expected that the inmates will do the job, but the inmates were not trained for such an -- a bi -- big masses of people to handle. They -- I mean, if that would have been -- in the men's camp, in Auschwitz, it was different. See, you had the prisoners, the male prisoners, were all ex-Polish officers, yeah. They knew how to handle their troops, how to control. They were obey -- they</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

But that was the difference of the Polish male, and the older German male, of prisoners, and the women, yeah.</p><p>Not because they were more capable, but it was an different background, yeah. We had -- many of the Poles were soldiers, ex-soldiers. The Germans were ex-soldiers too, or had military training, or had the -- were -- for example, we had a lot of s -- people who were in the Spanish Civil War, amongst the Germans. So they had -- there wa -- th-there was no problem with the German male -- male pr -- with the -- the male prisoners in Auschwitz. But the problem occurred only among the women, because they had no -- no military training.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So that when you were in Auschwitz one --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- what's going on with the men is totally different from what's going on with the women?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, definitely. And there was no contact, and that there was an policy from the first day on, that if there is any job which a woman can do, in the woman's camp, or the woman's section, than the woman had -- will have preference. But if they don't find a woman, then a male will be brought over to do the job, yeah. And that's how I got my job, because I had a male profession. I was the only male -- woman in -- in -- in my country, in my profession, and when they were looking for somebody who could mix paint out of raw material, and produce those red stripes on the clothing, which I explained in prior interviews with you, they preferred me, because I was a woman who worked with -- perform in the woman's camp. If they wouldn't have found anybody, then the male would have brought.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: He would have done it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: They would have brought in a -- a man to do the work. So that was the difference.

They were sent -- take to Birkenau, yeah, and to -- burned in open pits, or wherever.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They only burned the people -- non-Jewish people who died, and then supplied the urns to their relatives, yeah. They were dead people, not gassed people.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So that is an whole story which has to be explored, and to -- read, how they have developed their killing process in Auschwitz one, and then later in Birkenau.

If they were non-Jews, then they have returned to earth with some dirt, so they are not even the ashes. But otherwise, I have -- I had very little interest in the whole business, because we have learned of the gassing pretty late, yeah. And -- then later, while in Birkenau, and while I had been engaged, and I received an drawing office in the camp office, and I was engaged to pr -- to produce some diagrams with all the movements in the camp -- in the women's camp. He said I had to produce those diagrams who were then sent over to Berlin. It was only then that I became more interest in the gassing process, because | had to register the daily gassing of women in the camp. And that, I re -- I had reported every -- every end of the month I received some daily reports of those gassings, and had to enter that on the diagram. So that's why I knew about it, and why sometimes we had to -- the people who were already pre -- prepared us, or -- not prepared, but people who were decided o-of their killing, through gas, were still alive while I already had to enter them on my diagram as -- as dead people, yeah. That wasn't -- that wasn't bad, the hardest part of it was between the selections in -- in -- in those selections, yeah, not of newcomers, but those who were living in the camp. The selections, the transfer to the gas chamber, it took sometimes on whole, maybe 12 hours, but in advance, we already had to register them as dead, because they were not alive any more, was in the trans- transfer process. It's very hard to explain, and hard to -- to bel -- to -- to understand the -- psychologically how hard it was on my system. Couldn't do much.</p></p></dialogue>

Just like I would say compare with you have in front of you, people who are dying, yeah?</p><p>You only don't know when they are going to die, but they are in the stage of dying.

It was an -- you must understand, and you will not understand, but nevertheless, Auschwitz and Birkenau had sub-camps -- so-called sub-camps.</p><p>Now, to make you -- give you an idea, those sub-camps, in our English language they are sub- camps, but there is no German word for it, yeah. The German system of the camp in Birkenau and Auschwitz, in the German language, in their own language, had two types of sub-camps, yeah. That is now hard to explain, but there is no -- again, no word for sub-camps. They were -- if I would like -- if you would like me to translate that by the wording, I'm going to give you the German name. There was one type of camp which was -- one type of sub-camps, which was called a branch camp, Zweig lager, and Zweig, Z-w-e-i-g, is a branch of a tree, yeah?</p></p></dialogue>

It's not always wise to translate exactly, because sometimes you get some stupid results out of it. But lets call the other one sub-camp, yeah? Okay?</p></p></dialogue>

So sh-she selected some of the Auschwitz people which she wanted to take along with her, and nobody from the camp office, and nobody knew what's going to happen, whom she's going to take. It would have been an advantage, because there would have been no crematorium, yeah. So they prepared a list whom she selected in the camp office. We had one typewriter, and one woman typed the list. So I wanted to know if I am on the list, because it was, after all, an big event to leave Auschwitz, and join the staff of the biggest SS woman in the world. And -- but the woman who produced the list was mean, and didn't wanted to tell us. So, what am I doing, the list was prepared, and it went to Berlin.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: To do that, you had to report every day, once or twice, and every day once or twice, hours and hours were spent on the roll call.

The amount of the people had to coincide with the estimated amount which was set every day. We had -- that was an very complicated and important, quote unquote, thing. Only [indecipherable] to be busy, or to be engaged was already a -- a -- a big job, the roll call. Hours and hours [indecipherable] you had to prepare the food intake and distribution, which -- I mean, the distribution was done by the individual blockelteste, but you had to order it, you had to request it, every day.

There were functions which involved with the cardex system. People were dying, out of the living cardex, into the dead cardex. There were reports to be written daily, on certain thing which they requested by headquarters. I had -- I myself had an lot of work to do, which I cannot explain right now. You had the interaction between the work detail office, and the camp office, due to those movements, they are already an full time job, yeah.

I am in touch with Dr. Schreiberwined, I'm in touch with Emma Pronska, Emma Weiss, and some of the nurses, but I tried to keep out of sight, because it was an very infectious -- infectious en- environment, so I never entered the hospital if I had not -- had to -- I mean, I tried to avoid the hospital.</p></p></dialogue>

So I measured out the whole camp, and everything, and made myself a line drawing with pencil, on the top of the desk, and put the number of the block in. So when an SS man was coming, and asking where is the block, I told him I could show him immediately where it is. So when I noticed it worked so nicely, I had the plan flat on my desk, I said I'm going to build the barracks, and in colors exactly, and I'm going to make an little model, without asking anybody.</p><p>The material I had, and when I started, and Mandel once visited, and thought what I'm -- and saw what I am doing, she said [indecipherable] and Hessler was there. "Carry on, you can do anything, you can measure out whatever you want. But, don't include the crematorium. You can put anything on, but no crematorium." Okay. So I engaged in little -- Hans [indecipherable] was an architectural student in Poland, or in France, and we are started to build that nice little model.</p><p>It was so nice we made [indecipherable] barbed wire, everything was on. So -- soil, glued -- put the glue on, and sprinkled sand on so it stuck. I made an professional model, okay, out of the camp. Now, then I had an friend who was one of the Polish underground workers. He was an electrician, and him I engaged to put me in front of the entrance an little barb, electric barb like an -- like an -- what we had over there, and underneath I had the battery, and so when you touched the two things, the camp was illuminated, yeah. Was an good model, very professional.</p><p>Then, one nice day they were -- put me on an glass top on that, and were taking it out to the commandant, Hesse, into his office. That was the end of it.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because we are living in a normal life, in a normal environment. Who f -- f -- I mean, New York is an big city, but a little village, a little -- an borough, whatever community, what does the ordinary person know about the structure of the city hall? In spite of the fact that we have television performance, exposure, we know that people can come and discuss it, and present their problems, and there's a group of people, com-committees, and so on, who are listening, who are going ahead, and are engaged in problem solving, and betterment of certain malfunctions, t- trying to help, and to make life more bearable. But who -- who knows how -- how the system works? Who knows the mechanics? Now why should the ordinary person in Auschwitz have known the mechanics of the camp, or the camp leadership? Why are we expecting that? Only those who were engaged, or are engaged today in city hall business will know, and know, and know how to go ahead, and how to conduct the certain sessions, and how to conduct the leadership. I mean, how to engage in the leadership, and what to do. The ordinary -- I don't know what the -- how they are -- how it works. And there's no plan of -- of s -- simplified to explain to the public, not even who is who. And who -- who's -- who is doing what. Wh-Why do we expect -- know that ev-every ordinary, poor, ex, dirty, stinky inmate, hungry, half-dead musselman, should know what happened in Birkenau, and in Auschwitz? Is that an answer?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: It's another thing for them to not know that there's any structure.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And learn more about the law, and they have a chance to -- even to study, but how many of those people will, after their sentence, be engaged in the cil -- in civil law? Just few who are interested. And same thing as here. Those who survived and were -- became interested later on, what really happened to them, they have learned, and they know a little bit more than the average person. But they participated in one thing, all of those -- of those who -- who are able to speak out. They mu-must remember how they were -- how they were perform -- not perform, transform from being an civilian into an inmate. They remember, even if a little bit, and not everything, how they -- what happened to them when they were stripped naked, when they were shaved, yeah, when they were registered maybe, yeah.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: So it is not just the people don't know, they were never exposed to anything.

And s -- hygiene, and then comes medical facilities, let alone a medication, or well-being during an -- an roll call, yeah. The roll call was actually the center of everything. Everything was built around the roll call, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So food is built around the roll call?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Depended on the roll call, the food supply, if there were a thousand people, and you have received 900 rations, yeah, there was an problem. So as we mentioned yesterday, and I explained to you that the male prisoners -- the non-Jewish male prisoners, who were there much earlier than the Jewish prisoners, male and female, the male prison -- non-Jewish male prisoners were mainly ex-military people, fren -- from France, from each country. They knew what an roll call is, they knew that an -- the formation into five and all that, is of importance to make things easier and quicker, but the women did not understood, and the Jewish male, especially of the religious sect, did not understood, yeah. Now they think that they have committed an act of resistance, those idiots, yeah? That was no act of resistance, to -- to made it impossible to be counted, that was an k-killing situation. They were beaten, they were -- they have extended the duration of the roll call, and a -- the s -- it -- stupidity of they're not allowed to be counted, and all that, did not help, so again -- and we were not soldiers, the women were not soldiers, ex-soldiers, we didn't know what it meant in the beginning at least, and then later on, of course it -- we have learned what -- what the roll call is, but it was an torture, because we hadn't -- the people had no experience, they didn't understood. And everybody wanted to stand during a lo -- roll call with her sister, while moving forward, and backwards, and they were -- they had the ti -- never made any sense. They -- they did not understood, nobody's there to explain, yeah, so.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you try to create a system where the blockelteste would explain to the women what you were doing, so that they wouldn't act in this chaotic way?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: The blockelteste, no. Th-There was told -- look, people in charge had certain obli -- had certain -- no -- had an obligation, certain obligation to tell the people, come out, we have to count you. Stand in fi -- in -- in five rows, yeah. Who had time, in an hungry, wild, hoard, th -- the -- it was an wild hoard of people, yeah, who had time to speak and to explain, and who was listening, yeah?

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was the order. If you did it, fine. If not, you were hit. There was hitting going on, pushing, kicking, screaming. So that was not an normal situation, you had hungry, wild people, who didn't know what is going on, and nit -- did not understood, and you could not talk, because there was no time to talk. You -- if you wanted that people should do something, you s -- the f -- you were giving an order, and if they did not obey to the order, they were be-beaten, and once they were beaten, things -- it was an horrible situation. And then the SS came in, and they were coming with dog. They had to be -- it -- it was an wild horde of hungry, miserable people, yeah, in the beginning. Later on, when they have learned -- it took awhile, that if they are going out, and they do that quick as possible, they can go back quick as possible. That meant they could rest longer, they could sleep longer, there was no beating. But it took awhile, but there was no tal -- This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

She must have been wild, too, because she must have ec -- behaved just like what I explained to you before, that an blockelteste will use water fe -- every drop of water was so precious, she must have behaved impossible, yeah. But that she doesn't know, and does not even bother to explain. Then she mentions the name of the blockelteste, yeah. That woman lives here, and I know her very well.</p><p>She was not an bitch, she was a normal human being, who was living later on in a displaced person camp, and believe me, she would have been such an horrible woman, she wouldn't have survived one day. So, she doesn't even bother to find out who that blockelteste was, yeah. You know s -- her name, she mentioned her name. So the bucket of water, that was the big -- big event that she used a bucket of water to calm her down. But can you imagine how wild she must have been? And we had man-many, many of those people, who just turned crazy.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Not the way it functioned -- at -- and you're right, how would they know, but in spite of the fact of studying it for so long, I myself have not, until now, really understood that without that, you can't do anything in that camp, for good or ill.

Those decisions were made for -- merely for the whole system in all Germany, so it was made at an very high level. I couldn't tell you where, and who was responsible for it, but just like the civilian population had their food rations, and which applied to each German citizen, and -- or applied to -- to the German population of an certain working group, like light industry, or heavy industry, or whatever, there were certain standards set, yeah. Now, so they were set certain standards for the concentration camp population, and we have information of the caloric intake, and the caloric standards, or supplies for the civilian population, and for the working population in the -- and in the working -- in the camp population. Now, those special rations which every two weeks or so were supplied to heavy -- to indus -- to workers who were working in heavy industry -- prisoners or civilians were sometimes identical, yeah. And there are studies made, there are tables, there are reports on that.

And a bunion is no fun, and most people must undergo surgery because it hurts. I have decided not to undergo surgery, and I have decided no matter how expensive, and how pretty the shoe is, I have cut out an hole on each pair of shoes, where the bunion grew. And if you are looking today my -- at my li -- leg, I have no bunion any more.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What did that mean between those two people, and another two people?

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Everybody wasn't what?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Nice. It was a difficult circumstance, so people have complicated ways of --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Look, the people amongst themselves in the barrack, if th-they were living in an barrack, and worked in the same work detail, yeah, are so tired at the evening, and were so busy to look after their own business. That means eating, and sleeping, yeah. There was no time for being nice or not nice. You will have today among people in good conditions living, neighbors are fighting neighbors, yeah. It's human. Some people, they're fighting with their mouths, yeah. Fist fights, nobody wanted to lose any energy. So it's harmless if you scream at each other. I don't even consider that as not nice, just human to let it out. And I really don't know -- or don't think that to make an big issue out of it. People were very tense, or weak, or tired, or sleepy, or hungry. So sometimes they screamed at each other, and screaming is harmless. I don't think that screaming is a crime. Not even if the blockelteste were scre -- the blockeltestes were screaming. To -- to judge blockelteste and other screaming personnel, f -- only for one reason that they were screaming, is not justified.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Sippy, you not only didn't have watches, you didn't have calendars, right?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: There were different types of runners. There were even runners, I can show you very nice pictures of Indian tribes in the old times, and Indian tribes today, South American Indian tribes, where people live in the high plateau of the Andean mountains, where they have no other communication, like verbal communication between one tribe and another, by using individuals, the so-called runners, yeah? They walk from one village to another and communicate, or convey messages, and so on. So the runner business is not an invented one of the concentration camp, but as we had no vehicles, the ter -- the distances between camp -- in the camp, between</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Bicycles were not used for -- for -- inmates couldn't u -- did not have any bicycles, only the SS, some of them were able to use bicycles. The SS runners actually had bicycles. An runner is somebody who conveys messages, or who has an job to do, to do it fr -- [indecipherable] from one point to another, and ha -- with a certain order to do something, to bring some people from one barrack to -- to another, to -- to the front entrance for any reason, or to -- is a messenger service, more or less. Now, there were no -- no other way of communication, no-not even telephones, yeah. They have used people who were messengers, yeah. So, sometimes they had dual -- an dual duty. Sometimes they were runners who were sent from one - - from the main e -- from the camp office, for example, to an barrack, and convey an message or ask the blockelteste to come to the camp office, or some similar orders were given from headquarters, from the t-top management to us, and we had to execute that through the runners, yeah. Through those people who are sending them through different barracks, or different facilities to -- to convey an certain order, or message, or whatever. And they work mainly in couples. When the one couldn't do it, then the other took over, yeah, or when one was on lunch break, or in the toilet, and something has to be done in a hurry, the other took over. They were couples molis. But then you had an other function of certain runners, who made an -- had an du- dual function. They were multi-lingual, and could be used as translators. So, such, for example, was Mala, was an runner, and an translator between German and French, and German and I think Polish, she could speak Polish.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's Mala Zeemadbel.</p></p></dialogue>

Her maiden name then was Ava Pomeranz. She was an -- an -- one of those runners who took, like Mala, and many others, who were taking sometimes people from the camp office, who were asked to report to our camp office, and were then taken for -- with those runners, and an SS man, over to the Gestapo for interrogation, yeah. That was one of the activities, too, to accompany certain people who have to appear at the SS headquarters in the shtopskaboida for interrogation. That was ma -- one of the main activities of the shtopskaboida of personnel, SS with their secretaries. Now, there was Mala, there was Ava Pomeranz, and so on. So, there are some still alive, and I know where they are, and I even made myself a list of all the runners. So, it was an important activity, because without telephone, and without vehicles, and with such an big enterprise was -- there was so many movements going -- so many things going on, that they had that -- that it was a messenger service among others, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>

I went over to her, and I said, "What are you doing here? Get down from the table." She didn't understood. I said, "Get down. Look, you are now in Auschwitz.

Now -- then, all of a sudden, the day when she escaped, you know that she had malaria, and she used to have attacks from time to time, and we knew that.

Then she was ordered -- then -- then the Hauptchafuehrer Maul, ordered her to carry her into the crematorium, where she was shot by him, and that was it. Then the father of the -- Edek was brought in from an village, was hanged in front of his son, and then he was hanged. So that was an badly planned escape. That was selfishness. She put so many people into -- into trouble, and lost her life. And she could have survived easily, like all us, and could have led a normal life.

Very clever, very shrewd, and s -- again, as they had no Polish Jewish girls in the camp office whatsoever, they had a hard time to help each other to get -- Polish Jewish girls had no good positions because of that. So, there were some work details which were better. For example, the work details, indoor work details, yeah. Pretty good, and [indecipherable] the Polish girls could be accommodated. Rosa helped -- tried to help them through me, yeah. She made contact with me, and whenever she needed something, she approached me, and I helped her. But sh -- I was never recruited by her for anything else, yeah. We had an entire different relationship. She knows -- she had what she wanted from me, I had what I wanted from her. I -- She organized for me all my underpanties, and all the ma -- bowls of -- rolls of material to make, quickly, handkerchiefs for your head, to cover when newcomers arrived, especially from my city, in the lase -- late autumn, "44. She brought me a lot of material when I could go to the barrack, and supply the people, they never received -- it was cold, [indecipherable]. They never received any covers, so there where she helped me, and she helped me to steal from the clothing barrack, whatever -- whatever I needed, and I helped her by placing people, whenever she asked me.

And his name was En -- Hen -- Henyek Borepsky. Henyek Borepsky was the official electrician, who was in charge of checking the wirings, electric wiring, all over the whole area. Henyek Borepsky was the one who buried s -- many of the Jewish and non-Jewish reports the people wrote in all their languages, in -- who buried that during our stay there, and then after the war, made it possible to un-bury the stuff. We have more stuff, the information we had after the war, thanks to him, and due to him.

So that why she suspected me, I must have had something to do with them. That's all. And he asked me for hundred thousand things to do for him, and I never have asked any questions, I did it. So, I probably worked for the Polish underground without know -- I knew I worked for somebody, or I did things for somebody, but I have not ask any questions. That was an very basic rule, if you do something, either you do it or not, and if you are doing it, don't ask questions, because what you know -- you should never know, in case you were caught.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I knew that -- I knew -- they knew that I -- I can have the access to it, because nobody would have questioned me, what are you doing there, right? So, I -- and two minutes later, I was coming with the answer. After all, I had constant reports of certain things, I told you that I did the diagrams and so on, so I didn't -- I knew exactly w-w-what to look for, and where to look for, and quickly, so that -- because there could have been any time, somebody coming from the SS, and so on. But we always had some people out at the door entrance to watch out. In any case, Nonyek arrived, and asked me for information.

Now, what he did afterwards with that, if they have smuggled something in the container, if that was just to recognize that it is an different doxsa, because my writing and my -- must have been different than the original print. But then, from then on, he was coming with similar mishugas, yeah, to do for him, and I did it. I never asked any questions.
