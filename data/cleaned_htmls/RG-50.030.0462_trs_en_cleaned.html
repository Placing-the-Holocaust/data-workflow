This is tape number one, side A. Sippy.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes my -- madam?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I want to ask you a bunch of sh -- sort of short -- I don't know whether they're short questions, but they seem --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: How sh -- yeah [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- they seem like little -- they seem like little questions to me. So, we'll see whether -- cause I went through all of our conversations, so I have some small questions, and I have some larger questions. So, here's my first question, okay? You said, when you disembarked, when you got to Auschwitz, you disembarked in the town of Oswiecim.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Is that right?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Correct. Out -- outside of Stohn, I would say, it's very -- very -- very ofsa town, compared like New York, and maybe Welfare Island. Yeah, a little bit. Just close enough, but outside of the center of the -- of the town, yeah. There wasn't all -- actually, now, after 50 years, I can even show you a map which we have produced, together with the Auschwitz Museum. They have asked me the same question, so we produced some little diagram, a map.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Of where you disembarked?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="0"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Of where it is in the location, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was outside -- I would say it was not the railway station, but it was the railway station for -- for goods, yeah. Like cattle. They have embarked merchandise, and like here, for example, I don't know how -- how railway stations work [indecipherable] we have people, and we have cattle, and we have all kind of things.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right, right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Now, in Europe, people -- as the railway stations in Europe are small, because they have the railway stations in -- for little cities, and larger cities, concentrated mainly for people. And everything else is a little bit far out. It stops before the -- before the general railway station, so I would say a couple of miles.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Couple of miles.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And that what happened to us. We were not e-embarked -- disembarked?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Bark? Embarked, or disembarked?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Dis-Disembarked.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Disembarked where people were used to travel, and -- and -- and come or go, but we were disembarked where the cattle --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Cattle go.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right, that was it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Let me -- I'm going to stop the tape for one second.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I-In Auschwitz --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay, we're back. Yeah.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: In Auschwitz, I produced -- I had the same question from the people of the Auschwitz museum, so I predi -- produced together a plan, and the route how we were then walking by foot from the place of disembarking --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- over to the camp in the -- because Auschwitz, one camp where we were taken, there were only a couple of -- half a mile -- well, ish -- well [indecipherable] close.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It was close?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Very close, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell -- tell me what your condition was when you got off. You were with a thousand women, about.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Y -- but today we know we were a little bit less than thousand women, but it's supposed to arrive thousand women, and some of the people were taking off before the -- before the people that were put into the cattle cars. [indecipherable] maybe two or three of thousand girl.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh, right. And do you recall how long a trip it was? A few days?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh, that --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Or less?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was for us -- in those days, it appeared longer than it really was, yeah. We have been in the car at least one night for sure, yeah. And the whole day trapped, we embark in late afternoon, so we traveled the whole afternoon, then we traveled the whole night, then we traveled a whole day.</p><p>So that was for sure. Maybe 1-if -- today I cannot even bet. I s -- remember that we arrived on -- on Sunday, late afternoon, and we eb -- embarked on a Friday afternoon. So how much is that?</p><p>Tell me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: From s --  <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Friday afternoon, Saturday -- Friday night, Saturday, then it must have been Saturday night, and over to Sunday. And that -- what it -- what it peared -- appeared to me then, I even mentioned that in the borders -- borders interview. Today, after 50 years, somehow it is -- it was shrinking in my mind of one day, one night, and another day, yeah. But I don't remember certain night any more, yeah, today. But I d-definitely remember one night. So, that's how it goes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember the mood that you had on the train?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Pardon?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The -- your mood.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Food?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mood.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, so mood?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: There was no mood. Fif -- you know, fi -- we have been one week in -- on stage of isolation in [indecipherable] point, which was cold, but dronga, on the old factory hall. And wi -- we had enough to eat, because everybody who was there brought some food along from home, so that we were living on. They did not supplied us any food. You are not asking an important question, but the people somehow managed to -- everybody had something from home, yeah, and somehow that was our -- that kept us somehow in a mood, yeah, if you are talking about mood. I don't even remember, there was nothing to drink. I don't remember anything to drink, and we went probably the whole week, nothing to drink.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: From the time you --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- got into Petronka until --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, there was no --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- nothing?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Nothing. There was no food distribution. That means whatever we had, maybe some fruit or so, replaced the -- some water, and it was -- there was no mood, it was some very strange situation, because we were -- we -- we have never experienced anything like that. We went as young people to -- to summer camps as children, and as teenagers. We -- they were -- we were told we have to -- we will go and do some work in the fields, or whatever necessary, because there's no -- not enough manpower, or woman power, or whatever power, work. There -- there is not enough of -- there are not enough of people for certain jobs available, because everybody's -- the male are on the front, and the women in that -- to work in factories, so do other things, the civilians. So we were actually selected to do jobs wherever we need it -- wherever we are needed, yeah. So, nobody was com -- very excited. The war went on, and so what? But for weeks or months we'll survive and come back home, that what we are told.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: So there was not a -- really no -- no mood. Just we have taken things [indecipherable], we -- we realize that something must be done, and that is what they want us to do, to do some odd jobs, and [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So there was no suspicion about something terrible --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- going to happen? Nothing?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Not at all, not at all. The only people who knew about the terrible things which are in front of us, were -- was the Jewish community's board of -- the so-called Jewish centers, the Juden Centrales, they knew that things aren't going too good for us. But they never disclosed anything.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> </p><p> But I know we know that they knew, after the Wannsee Conference, yeah, what is in front of -- what's in front of the population [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right. And you think they knew?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They knew.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: They knew?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: They knew. They didn't know about the gas chambers. They didn't know about the real f -- that -- that factory, because they knew that it doesn't look good for us, but they couldn't --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- they said they really didn't know. Because when the first people escaped from Auschwitz, those four boys, you know, Wirbra, Vetsla, Mordavich, and Rossi, and when they returned, to report, you wouldn't believe it. All Jewish people --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Don't do that.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- wouldn't believe. So, that's why I know and suspect that, you know, they didn't know the real techniques of Germans [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But when you -- by the time you got on the train --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- to go to Auschwitz, you must have been weak, all of you. Were you weak?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Weak?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Weak?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You weren't?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Even though you weren't eating much or drinking much?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: We are eating or not, because everybody brought --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Brought something?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- some food along.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So when you get -- you get in the train --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Is this -- this is a cattle car train, or you're sitting in s -- how -- what sort of a train did they put you in?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Cattle car train.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Sitting on the floor.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Floor. And did they pack you in, or was it not so bad?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It wasn't nice.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It wasn't nice, but even that, we couldn't -- so we were only young girls, you see. The other -- other people went with families, husbands and children.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right, right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We were young people, couldn't care less. Even if it was only with [indecipherable] for to work, but not youngsters -- very similar to those f-festivals we had, where the youngsters were squeezed together, and were happy and singing, yeah?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Th-though we were not singing, and we were squeezed together, yeah, but it [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did people get beaten?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Huh?</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were people beaten, were you treated brutally, or not?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, no, no, they were very careful, very careful not to -- not to s -- give us any feeling of -- to become suspicious. No, we were just left alone, I would say. There were no guards inside. Yeah, they left us alone. No screamings, and no -- no beatings, nothing. So first real rough situation occurred when we arrived in Auschwitz itself. Because before, on the trip we were -- I think that was an combined -- combined operation between the guards of the Slovakians, and the Germans.</p><p>The Slovaks took us to the border, and after the border, the Ger -- the bor -- not the border, it's in Poland already, so Germans, they took over. But -- so, disembarking went very rough, yeah. Un - - un -- unexplainable rough. Obvious different types of people, different uniforms, different commands, everything changed, and then we still didn't know what it is all about. So, it took us a couple of days to get used, while arriving in Auschwitz, and th -- we went through the procedure, in the first couple of days. So, that taught us gradually, that life -- the prior life of ours, is behind us, yeah. And --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did you --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- we have entered a new world.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you understand German then? Did you know -- you knew German.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [have German schools.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: After the --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So, all the girls --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- [indecipherable] school -- pardon?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- all the girls understood German?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But many.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Many.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: The girls -- as most of the girls were from our capital city, where -- which is an German speaking city, among others. It's ambu -- multilingual city. But most of the Germ -- of the Jewish girls, of course, went to German elementary schools. If nothing else, they went to elementary schools, because the German elem-elementary schools -- the Jewish element-elementary schools were German --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- in those days, it was shortly after World War Two, the people were born, the G-Germans --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You mean World War One, they were born shortly after --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: World War One, correct, sorry. Th-Those girls were born, the parents enrolled them in Jewish elementary schools because they were good. They s -- have just transferred that from the Austrian system into the Slovak system. So that -- you must realize people, like Jewish parents, always prefer to send their kids to good schools, yeah. They have preferred the German, because that wa -- the elementary schools had the teachers, the language -- I mean the system was already established, while the Slovak system had to be established. There was not even a Slovak grammatic. It has to be developed in those days. But we spoke all -- we had to speak Slovak, and the city had a large Hungarian population from the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, but the Jewish people never -- ne -- in our city, Bratislava, never had any -- that -- they preferred the German.</p><p>The Hungarian was mainly in the hands of non-Jews, yeah. It was the old fa-fashioned m- monarchies, yeah. We had none -- nothing in -- in our community like that. So --</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, let me ask you someth -- I just thought of this. What were you wearing, on your -- do you remember?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was wi -- it was early -- it was early spring, March in Europe, and in that part of Poland was rough, and cold. So, not knowing where we are going, we all had -- definitely we had no high heels. A-As a matter of fact, I can show you a picture of the shoes which I wore.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because they were the shoes I have picked just from prior years, during my -- our times in camps, and so on, where I had some special, very good mountain climbing shoes, yeah. I put that on, and not knowing -- I knew that we are not going into a city, but maybe into the fields, or other [indecipherable] rural areas. So I accordingly dressed myself, and shoes were always of importance wherever you went, even -- I mean, those shoes, I took the best and most durable, strong shoes I had. And as a matter of fact, I have a picture of those shoes [indecipherable]. So, what else? And I had on good winter coat, a wool winter coat. I -- and I had gloves, and on cover of a knitted angora -- kind of an turban, something what we wear today, knitted, very nice, in dark green, I don't know if -- in bottle green, I never forget that. So gloves, and the cover of my head. No, that was all I remember.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You don't remember were you wearing a skirt?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Ah?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you wearing a skirt, or you were wearing pants, do you have any -- remember?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: N-No, no, I had no -- I've a -- I wore skirt and one pullover.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And most of the other women that you were with?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Similar, very similar.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Similar dress?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Very similar, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And people were not wearing high heels, they didn't.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh no, definitely.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No. You knew, right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Sporty. Yeah, prepared for some -- a rural -- a rural environment.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Now Sippy, you told me that you saw a sign --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- when you were walking into the area. The sign say, KZ Auschwitz, or Concentration Lager, what does it say?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, that was lots of sign when we went that was exactly on the door entrance.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: At the entrance.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: At the entrance, and it was hitting me like you would have hit me over the head. You see, I told you that I was an trained sandwriter.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: A graphic artist. I always looked at letters, and signs, and that's why I could remember so many other things, even now where I don't see, the first thing I'm looking at an area where I am, I'm looking at the road signs, and if I cannot see, then I'm asking people to read for me. Signs are something of importance. And I was reading everything what I could at the entrance. There was one little white sign with black letters. So little, I would say like an standard American --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Foot?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Letterhead, [indecipherable] but sheet of --  <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Paper?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Of paper, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Like eight by 11?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Eight by 11, or something like that, in white. And there was on pr-printed, or painted wording -- the wording, it said, Concentrationes Lager. Concentration Camp, yeah. No more, and no less.</p><p>I have never -- and that was -- I could not share that with anybody because those girls didn't know what it is all about. I had experience with ex-German Jews, who were leaving, and Austrian Jews who left, all immigrants from all parts of Europe, they were coming through our city for awhile, and then left again. And they told us what a concentration camp is, because some of them were even relieved just under one condition to leave Germany, yeah. So, I knew that I entered an concentration camp, in spite of the fact that we really went through the door which said [indecipherable] fry. There were the stop signs, hahlt, yeah. All kinds of -- of warning signs, and important to the whole entrance of the camp, which even today I think you can see. But that little sign of concentration camp, was there, I don't know why, it must have been there for the -- to the rules, yeah, or to international rules. It was there, and I noticed it. And then I know I'm in a concentration camp. In the beginning, I didn't -- we knew that after awhile, but the moment I entered that gate, I knew where I am. That was an --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So that must have been shocking.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Don't do that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. It's [indecipherable]. I forgot. Yes, it was. And even then, so we -- look, it was the end of our private, previous life, we knew that. We didn't know what's in front of us, we didn't know</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="11"></span> </p><p> how to cope with our past, yeah. But I knew that I'm in a concentration camp, from the very first moment on.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In this group that you came in with.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were there close friends of yours, or these were just acquaintances?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, it's -- you could -- look, it was funny. Nearly everybody knew everybody, but we were shifted forward and backward, and pushed around. So if you had a little group of people, two minutes later you belonged to another group, yeah. My very first contact in co -- it's very strange. My very first contact with somebody whom I haven't known before, and somehow drove -- drove us close to each other, was Katya, who became then the top administrative inmate of the women's camp. Katya Singr, now how -- what happened? While we were still laying on the straw, on the floor in that factory hall the first day, she's -- had an very deep voice, and that woman started to cry, and to scream loud, and crying, and crying --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: This isn't --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- like an bad baby, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: This isn't Petronka?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Nonstop. No, she -- there was a reason to cry, of course, we all could have cried, but she just cried, no. I went over to her, just ask her to stop to cry, we are all in the same boat, yeah. And she has no right to scream, and to cry, and to -- it will not help. And I was sitting next to her, and she stopped crying. So we became friends. I was the only person who spoke to her, and so then, we shared our belongings, the food, until we were put into the cattle car. She was in the same cattle car, we stick together somehow, as close as we could, because I felt I can in-influence her in making her a little bit more comforta -- feel comfortable, and she needed something like that,</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="12"></span> </p><p> okay? Now, while in Birkenau, when we arrive -- no, sorry, while in Auschwitz one, when we arrive, somehow it's her deep voice, and all that, she took -- she took control over some of the girls in one of the rooms, and was made immediately an Stubendienst in charge of one room.</p><p>After awhile they made her charge of the whole half of the barrack. And then she asked me -- yet -- but I went out to work. She asked me if I would like to stay with her, and to help. And I refused, because I thought I ge -- don't want to deal with people. That's about it. I didn't know how horrible the outer work really --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You didn't want to deal with people? What is --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, I did not want to deal with people, to be in command of people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Ah, aha.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Because you would have to do things you didn't --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I -- I -- I simply -- it was not -- I did -- I have no desire, yeah, to tell people what to do, or to distribute food, or -- I didn't like it. 1 wanted to go out to work, and come back and sleep, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>In -- but, then I had an accident, a -- a whole chimney -- while we were demolishing houses outdoors, an old chimney was falling on my back, and I felt very bad, and I had enough. So I approached somebody in charge of work detail, of the -- the -- one of the women of Ravensbriick, an German political prisoner, to help me to stay indoors, and if she could, arrange something. If somebody would believe that [indecipherable] and that's my profession. And -- because I still didn't wanted to stay with Katya, yeah. I didn't wanted to become a blockelteste, it's too [indecipherable] or whatever. I simply had no desire. It would have been nice if under normal conditions, but not there, where you had to be rough, or not even rough, but you had to scream, and you had to push people, and all right, that was it. Katya, I refused to help her. But</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="13"></span> </p><p> the other one, whom I approached, she helped me, and put me into -- into charge of -- s-some painting --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: The painting.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- the red stripes. That story of the red stripes you have, correct?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right, right, yes. But I want to -- I want to go back a -- a little bit. When -- when you first arrived into Auschwitz one.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you go -- you went into barrack 10, or barrack nine?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: One of th --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Upper -- upper part of barrack nine. Which -- all upper parts, which most people don't know, administratively, there's A barracks, and the lower part --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was the B.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, no --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: No.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No A and B, only A.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: A.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Now, block nine, barrack nine was down, and barrack nine A on top, first floor [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Mm-hm. I see.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And 10 the same, and eight the same, the upper ones, they are always the A one. So early writings will mention the A numbers [indecipherable]  <span class="page-break" number="14"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And that means the upper, that means --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah, the extra floors in Auschwitz.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right, right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The upper one was always an A -- A -- A [indecipherable] always an A.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right. Now you mentioned to me that when you first arrived, it was clear that nobody knew how to organize this camp --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Nobody.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- that it was completely chaotic. It's --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Extremely chaotic.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And wh --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Extremely, because --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: As if they weren't expecting people?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Who -- who sh -- who expect the people? They never -- people coming in by the thousands?</p><p>An transport consisted of thousand men or women, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: They were used to have first people -- prisoners from jails, yeah. Poles, or Germans, who were transferred out of ja -- from jails to the camp. But never transports of certain groups by the thousands. And they were -- th -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Tape number one, side B, September seventh, with Sippy Tichauer in New York City. Okay, so -- so they were not expecting, except sort of normal prisoner movement?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Correct. And that was the first time that the a-a-ar -- arisar -- RSHA --  <span class="page-break" number="15"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: H-A.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- transports arrived to Auschwitz, yeah. The very first time, so they had no idea how to go about, and were trying to leave everything to the ex -- to the prisoners from Ravensbriick, who were specially brought over to Auschwitz to help to organize, because they had experience, while spending many years prior to that transf -- transfer to Auschwitz, in Ravensbriick. But even they were not trained, or prepared for such mass influx of prisoners. So they depended practically on whatever we created there by ourselves.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: If people were -- and -- and the prisoners who became, or who wanted to be in charge, they had no experience of handling people, or the -- not at schools, they were not teachers, there were no -- so they're just ordinary house girls, yeah. Never with an -- hardly professionals. Some of them had training in -- in office work, yeah. They succeeded because eventually the SS started to organize, together with the prisoners. I mean, food -- food had to be distributed. They didn't know how to go about that. So they had to learn how to distribute food, they had to learn by -- by experience, day by day, how to go about everything. So, it was not easy, it was in horrible chaos for weeks, and weeks, and weeks. And eventually, after months, when the relocation of the women, in August "44 -- no, "42, occurred, th-the relocation to Birkenau, it was still cow -- chaotic, but people were already used to it. Roll call was -- lasted hours. The SS was never trained, they were not very intelligent people. Very simple, primitive people, and they s -- expected that the inmates will do the job, but the inmates were not trained for such an -- a bi -- big masses of people to handle. They -- I mean, if that would have been -- in the men's camp, in Auschwitz, it was different. See, you had the prisoners, the male prisoners, were all ex-Polish officers, yeah. They knew how to handle their troops, how to control. They were obey -- they</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="16"></span> </p><p> obeyed commands, because they were treating each other still like in the army. But that was the difference of the Polish male, and the older German male, of prisoners, and the women, yeah.</p><p>Not because they were more capable, but it was an different background, yeah. We had -- many of the Poles were soldiers, ex-soldiers. The Germans were ex-soldiers too, or had military training, or had the -- were -- for example, we had a lot of s -- people who were in the Spanish Civil War, amongst the Germans. So they had -- there wa -- th-there was no problem with the German male -- male pr -- with the -- the male prisoners in Auschwitz. But the problem occurred only among the women, because they had no -- no military training.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So that when you were in Auschwitz one --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- what's going on with the men is totally different from what's going on with the women?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, definitely. And there was no contact, and that there was an policy from the first day on, that if there is any job which a woman can do, in the woman's camp, or the woman's section, than the woman had -- will have preference. But if they don't find a woman, then a male will be brought over to do the job, yeah. And that's how I got my job, because I had a male profession. I was the only male -- woman in -- in -- in my country, in my profession, and when they were looking for somebody who could mix paint out of raw material, and produce those red stripes on the clothing, which I explained in prior interviews with you, they preferred me, because I was a woman who worked with -- perform in the woman's camp. If they wouldn't have found anybody, then the male would have brought.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: He would have done it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They would have brought in a -- a man to do the work. So that was the difference. I -- now you understand why we had such an hard life in the beginning.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="17"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not because we were women, we had -- we had no military training, that's what I want to say.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Sippy, around the area in Auschwitz one, where you -- where the women were staying --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- was there a barbed wire around it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, a wall was built.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: A wall?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: A wall was built. We -- we were located in todays blocks from one to 10.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, after 10 comes 11, th-the black wall. There were the women. And then, between us, parallel with those -- with the whole row, there was an wall erected.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I brought -- I brought so --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Pll show you that on the map, if you like.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, maybe we" ll do it later.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Uh-huh. Let me see if I can see. What have you marked here, neela?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's what I marked, I marked what I think is the women's camp.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Now, where's from one to 11?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Here.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Where's 11?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: 11 is here.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Good. The wall was here.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="18"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And when we left, they removed the wall.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: They removed the wall. So you had, presumably, your own kitchen?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: It's a separate kitchen, or --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, no.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- it's all coming -- the food is coming from the kitchen -- the same kitchen.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I couldn't tell you that, because I really couldn't te -- no, no, the kitchen was not an separate kitchen.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It wasn't?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. There was no kitchen on the map, either.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right, right. Now, did you get somehow registered those first couple of weeks, or what did they do? They --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, we were -- were registered very soon.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You were registered very soon?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Very soon. I would say even after two days or so, only we were not tattooed --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- straight away, but they have then -- we were registered. They thought we were with that little apparatus where they press the numbers in.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And it didn't last.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Which disappeared after awhile, and then we had to do it with the double needle. I explained that to you many times, right?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="19"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So, we were registered, definitely.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And the registration was on paper, and they also gave you some -- some -- the insignia [indecipherable] nothing</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: The registration was all -- that was an experienced -- experienced situation because the German concentration camp registration goes back to old times, so if you had here an couple of women were asked several questions, and you received your number, of course, and you received -- so that number you carry through the rest of your stay in the camp.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And you had to sew this on your --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Pardon?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you have to sew it on? Sew. You have to sew it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Sure. And th-this -- you see, we had in the beginning, Russian uniforms, you know that.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh look, think.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: No, I'm assuming they didn't, but I don't know. When you say Russian uniforms, what is it -- what --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Russian uniform from --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: The ar --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- their prisoners of war.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And -- but they were sh-small, because they have used some disinfecting technique which was shrinking.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: A steaming, yeah?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Even the steaming -- steaming of -- facilities are still there in Auschwitz, in Birkenau, if you go for a visit.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: The -- the big one at the --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: In the back.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The wa -- in the back.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And everything which went in are shrinking. No, anyhow, we had those uniforms, and when the uniforms -- when the influx of prisoners -- of newcomers, was so big that the Russian uniforms wouldn't last, then they introduced civilian clotheses of people who brought their stuff.</p><p>They have taken all the stuff away. The good things went over to -- transported to Germany, and the less good ones were distributed for newcomers. And they have -- they had to be marked with the red stripes, and there where my career started, by mixing the paint and painting the stripes.</p><p>That was the beginning --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- of my real artistic --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Your career.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- career.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No, we'll get that for a minute. Di -- were you able to keep your shoes?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, because every times they were -- somebody wanted to take my shoes away, especially with the German women, stopped me constantly, and they wanted to take my shoes off, because they looked so good and heavy. But they always too small, I had a small foot, and a small number, and not one of the German women was lucky enough. So I kept those shoes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So this was good for you. This was --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh boy, that saved my life in the beginning, in spite of the fact that in -- outdoor work, we were not allowed to march to the workplace with shoes, you had to go barefoot. You could only use the shoes during working time.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Why were they doing that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You ask me why? Ask me why.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="22"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And did you have to take them off when you walked back?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Carrying -- carrying the shoes with you, forward, and backward. What is it? Yeah, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: How soon did they try to tattoo you with a -- those -- that ink stuff that --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Which one?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: The first time. And it --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Soon, very soon.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Soon.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Very soon.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But I want to know something. Were they tattooing the men, or were they experiment --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: the men were tattooed.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: They were?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They were tattooing the men, and then the men were coming over to us, and started to tattoo us.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So how come it didn't work? They had men there for a long time. How come it --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Wait a minute, wait a minute. They never used those stamp for the men, yeah. They only started us to stamp. Somebody of the SS had an idea.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That this would be easier or something?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. Bang, bang. But it didn't work.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Then they have send us s-some man to do the tattooing. I was tattooed by -- by a man who -- whom -- who is still alive. I know him.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="23"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And you asked him to do a nice --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Huh?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You asked him to do a nice tattoo, yes?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And I told him to make me a smaller tattoo.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Small, right.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh. But you had told me a long time ago that she was Jewish.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: She was Jewish.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh. Is it the case -- this -- this it seems -- this I wrote down somewhere, that who -- well, let me ask it this way, who was in charge of the outside commandos? Was it different from the people who were in charge of the inside commandos in the beginning?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no, no, no, no, no, no. If you have, first of all, the whole structure, you must understand that you had an -- the SS structure, from top to bottom, was a military -- military-like business, or managerial-like business. You had top management, you had middle management, you had lower management.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And each SS level had their inmate assistance, yeah?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: So, if it comes to work, yeah, is a section of inside and outside work, belonged to the German expression I'm going to use, the Abbatz einsatz. The work sec -- the section of -- which a- arranged your employment, yeah, it was like an employment office, where there was an SS man in charge, and an assistant, which was always of -- an inmate. The inmate had to expedite the orders of his the -- the SS person who receives the order from my level, or from -- or from, yeah, higher level of s -- he -- of -- I mean, on higher authority, which was negotiating this private companies, for work -- for -- for wer -- manpower. If an factory needed workers, 500 women, for</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="25"></span> </p><p> example, especially women, they have asked for it, then it went over to the top man of the SS.</p><p>He was giving the order to the camp, a representative of his command of work det -- work work, like an department of work, an office where you -- where you apply for work, yeah? Or an office which is -- I don't know the American word of comparison, a civilian comparison --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- but it's an department of work. You have -- say you have --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So, like an employment office.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: It's like an employment office. We have had in our bu -- camp office, an section of after the registration of the newcomers, which went by profession, yeah? So if they were looking for people who could sew, or tailors, they need 50 tailors for an factory, they have coming to us --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: To find -- to get them.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- that we had the -- the registered people under this -- under -- the women who were telling us when they were registered they were tailors, yeah, or dressmakers. So we had our section by profession. We had [indecipherable] by profession. We had the [indecipherable] and the -- so where -- where am I now, I'm not -- I'm lost. What was the question?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Well, I w -- I -- I think I was -- I was asking a question before the camp office is actually formulated. I'm trying to get some idea of --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Of who was in charge of the indoor and the outdoor.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. In the be -- in -- before you had the camp office, before it beca -- becomes more ordered.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I'm trying to figure out the kind of chaos that you're describing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="26"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So yes, the chaos was settled gradually, by introducing the old German concentration camp system of abbatz dinkst, and abbatz einsatz.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Two people -- two SS sections, which were dealing with -- with like an employment office, and the office was supplied --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: The people.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: The people. Now, if they needed 500 road workers, they were just asking for 500 women next morning, to be ready to march out. And then they were just taking the people from the barracks, and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right, right, right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- put 500 together, and off they went. But that went always first to the SS commander, who asks them his counterpart of the inmate who was in charge of those [indecipherable] and -- and -- and the work -- work force, yeah, office. Now we have no words -- I mean I'm -- it's very hard to compare something with our civilian life, and our civilian structure. I'm trying to be --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- as simple as possible, and to make the comparison, so it should go into your head.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But does it answer the question?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah, well let me ask -- let me ask it in another way. When -- when you're talking about these first few months, including the time you're going out --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- on the demolition crews.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="27"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What's the effect on you and the women in b -- in it being so chaotic?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Nothing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Nothing?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Nothing. We -- we knew in the morning there were -- if you were in on work detail -- on constant work detail, and the SS leader of the work detail, because each work detail had an SS leader, too, in charge, if he was happy with you, he ask for you, and you --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Again? I see.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- you reported every time -- every morning to the same group of work detail. If you didn't wanted to go, then you were not going, yeah? Nobody -- they never knew where you are, and it wasn't big to [indecipherable] what is said on big, big [indecipherable] in the morning after roll call, the formation of work details. So they just grabbed the people, and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: 500 here, and 600 here, and 30 here, and that went e-every day the hunt, it was just like a hunt, yeah. I -- well --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: What was the -- what was the name of that -- the soldier who gave you an aspirin after you'd injured your [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I didn't know his name, but rank was --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You told me it was --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- finner his rank was an finnerish in German.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, that's his rank?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah, because --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I thought that's is his name.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I tell you why, I tell you why.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="28"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The inmate who was an kapo, a German woman, is her name there, Elli -- Elli Meyer?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes, the -- some -- I have it somewhere, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: She called him her finnerish. Now, she could not know his name, or you never a-addressed some SS person by his name, yeah. You called the SS people by their ranks. And that was the usual thing. So when she said to him a finneri, it couldn't be his name, it was his rank.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And I don't know what's an finneri, you have to look that up in an German dictionary --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- what an finneri means.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But he got you an aspirin?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Because you left?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because I left. Because those people who were admitted, were -- never made it to Birkenau during the relocation. So I -- I left, and then I approached another German woman, and told her about my profession.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, did this start happening before you moved to Birkenau? Before August?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yeah, oh yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, in May? May - June?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="36"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It started very soon, very soon. The moment we had no more Russian uniforms to supply, then the -- some of the Russians uniforms appeared again, because people were killed in the gas, and we received the business back, only the numbers had to be removed, because they were the numbers of the dead people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Dead people, yeah. So, Sippy, during this time --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Mm?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- they were gassing in Auschwitz one?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Huh?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: During this time --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- before you moved to Birkenau --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- they're -- they are gassing in Auschwitz one?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That, no, no.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: They're not?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They were gassing in Birkenau.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But that in --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: [indecipherable] house. Huh?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: No, no. But before you moved to Birkenau --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- between March and August, is there --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: See, it was --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- are there some gassings?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="37"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- it was -- there were rumors, but we -- we had no proof. We didn't know. We had no --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You didn't know?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No, we didn't. We knew that non-Jews were gassed, too, but I can't -- we -- we don't know where they were gassed, yeah. We had no sondercommando in our switzwan. So that's why we suspected that even if they have gas in our switzwan, the corpse were not burned in our switzwan. They were sent -- take to Birkenau, yeah, and to -- burned in open pits, or wherever.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>But they did not -- there were -- there were never people from the sondercommando working in Auschwitz one.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Auschwitz one.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They only burned the people -- non-Jewish people who died, and then supplied the urns to their relatives, yeah. They were dead people, not gassed people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So that is an whole story which has to be explored, and to -- read, how they have developed their killing process in Auschwitz one, and then later in Birkenau. But all I know is that non- Jews were gassed, too, yeah, in the beginning.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In the beginning, right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you believe the rumors?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Of course, we -- we knew that they were gassed, because we received their clothes in -- back in the -- after the gassing, with their numbers.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you didn't think they just died?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: [indecipherable] just died --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You assumed it was too ma --</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="38"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- you see, in the beginning it was very hard to -- to control and check rus -- what really happened, because there was no even interest in, or -- I mean, we had no need to distinguish one from the other. If they were non-Jews, then they have returned to earth with some dirt, so they are not even the ashes. But otherwise, I have -- I had very little interest in the whole business, because we have learned of the gassing pretty late, yeah. And -- then later, while in Birkenau, and while I had been engaged, and I received an drawing office in the camp office, and I was engaged to pr -- to produce some diagrams with all the movements in the camp -- in the women's camp. He said I had to produce those diagrams who were then sent over to Berlin. It was only then that I became more interest in the gassing process, because | had to register the daily gassing of women in the camp. And that, I re -- I had reported every -- every end of the month I received some daily reports of those gassings, and had to enter that on the diagram. So that's why I knew about it, and why sometimes we had to -- the people who were already pre -- prepared us, or -- not prepared, but people who were decided o-of their killing, through gas, were still alive while I already had to enter them on my diagram as -- as dead people, yeah. That wasn't -- that wasn't bad, the hardest part of it was between the selections in -- in -- in those selections, yeah, not of newcomers, but those who were living in the camp. The selections, the transfer to the gas chamber, it took sometimes on whole, maybe 12 hours, but in advance, we already had to register them as dead, because they were not alive any more, was in the trans- transfer process. It's very hard to explain, and hard to -- to bel -- to -- to understand the -- psychologically how hard it was on my system. Couldn't do much.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can you explain how hard it was on you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Pardon?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can you explain how hard it was on you to do that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="39"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Who?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How hard it was for you to do that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Could you speak a little bit louder?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can you explain how hard it was for you to do this? What did it do to you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Hard that you had -- that you have known the people are still alive, and they were registered already, had to be registered already for the next day's dead, yeah. It -- that is hard to explain, yeah. Just like I would say compare with you have in front of you, people who are dying, yeah?</p><p>You only don't know when they are going to die, but they are in the stage of dying. You feel very strange while you are still here in front of you the living body, and you know they may be dead tomorrow, or after tomorrow, but they are already in -- theoretically, in your mind, dead.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That is more or less the -- the same situation.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But did you ever have anything like that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah? You see -- and if you have masses of people, even if you have -- didn't know them, but you have an group of people by the hundreds, yeah, sometimes even healthy ones, and here they are, already dead on paper, and they're standing outside still on the -- on -- on th -- on the ground, and are still alive and breathing, and -- and -- and don't know that they're going to be dead tomorrow, yeah. That was hard. And just -- just like with an dying person who -- whom you know, and who -- where you know he is going to die, but he doesn't know, yeah? Or she doesn't know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="40"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And it's sometimes just a question of hours. Niya, is that an comparison?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. Yeah, I think so.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Good.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But let me go back to the painting for a moment.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: To what?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Painting. The painting of the stripe.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, you are an artist all of a sudden.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I want to know f -- you did it for a certain amount of time alone?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And then you brought in one woman, two women? Other people did it as well?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No? Only you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Only me, because I knew -- I knew how to -- to paint, how to mix the paint from raw material, yeah. That was on -- something you had to learn in -- as an professional, and not to -- like an housewife who can cook. Within -- it was the difference like between an chef, and the primitive peasant woman, both could cook, yeah?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right, right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: But the difference how to cook, is between an chef and then -- and then any -- any housewife can cook, right, or learn to cook, now --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But you weren't the only one who put the stripe --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, I was it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You was?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Later on --  <span class="page-break" number="41"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- when I was entrusted with -- of the printing of the numbers --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I trained some other people to do the stripes, but it was me who mixed the colors.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Always.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The paint, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. And for how long was this done?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: All the time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: All the time. So, if someone did not wear a uniform, the striped uniform which was common, they always had the red stripe.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But you said that you never had the red stripe?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But yours would re -- you -- yours would come off in the rain? You -- yes?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I did my red stripes with water -- on a water bases, so that it would come off, in case I would like to remove it. And I did it before we went on the Dead March, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Then I got myself a new coat from the [indecipherable] yeah, on other -- on coat, on warm coat, I painted the red stripe, which came off in no time, and I was prepared for any situation, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. So let's -- let's talk about the camp office.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The camp office?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="42"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Which camp office? Now listen very carefully. I have here --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Not the stopskaboida.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Uh?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Not the stopskaboida. Yours. Your office.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: What are you saying? Not what?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Not the stopskaboida.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Now wait a wi -- wait a minute. I have an dilemma.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: There is an group of people who worked, the secretaries for SS people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: As secretaries for the Gestapo. Each Gestapo man had one woman who worked -- was his secretary, whom he -- whom had to -- who was forewarned not to disclose anything what they are doing, otherwise they are going to be shot. It was an -- you must understand, and you will not understand, but nevertheless, Auschwitz and Birkenau had sub-camps -- so-called sub-camps.</p><p>Now, to make you -- give you an idea, those sub-camps, in our English language they are sub- camps, but there is no German word for it, yeah. The German system of the camp in Birkenau and Auschwitz, in the German language, in their own language, had two types of sub-camps, yeah. That is now hard to explain, but there is no -- again, no word for sub-camps. They were -- if I would like -- if you would like me to translate that by the wording, I'm going to give you the German name. There was one type of camp which was -- one type of sub-camps, which was called a branch camp, Zweig lager, and Zweig, Z-w-e-i-g, is a branch of a tree, yeah?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: For example.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="43"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And then there was an other type of camps, of sub-camps, which were called Abschnitts lager, A-b-s-c-h-n-i-t-t-s, Abschnitts lager, that means -- abschnitts -- I don't know what -- what it means in English. It's not always wise to translate exactly, because sometimes you get some stupid results out of it. But lets call the other one sub-camp, yeah? Okay?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: An Abschnitts mean -- would -- I would even say section, yeah? So whatever it is, it is still an sub-camp.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Only, but we don't -- but you and all other big shots don't know, is that one of those two were always -- the one will belong to one -- the one group, even if they were allocated two yards from the crematorium, belonged to an -- to heads of privilege -- privilege, in -- in commas, yeah?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Quotes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In quotes. Not to be exposed for gassing. As a matter of fact, they were forbidden to gas the people who belonged to those camps. While those who were part of the section -- what I'm calling section, underwent selections and could have got -- been gassed. Now comes an example, okay?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Let's go to the women's camp.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Harmense, Boody, Ricekoff, Shtopskaboida, B-Beetoogee, were all privileged branch camps.</p><p>There's no history in the Auschwitz -- there's no -- no example in the whole Auschwitz women's camp history, that there was ever a selection in those sub-camps, which I am calling an branch --</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="44"></span> </p><p> branch camp. Never, there was never in the whole history, an selection in Ricekoff, or in Harmense, or in Boody, or in the Shtopskiboidi, or --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Beetoogee.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: In Beetoogee. That is the [indecipherable] camp, which was next, between crematorium five and four. Good. While the other branch, or the other category of s -- of what am I calling --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Don't do that.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Huh?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Don't touch that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: What?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Don't touch that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: What? Ah --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You're touching my mi --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- while the other category, what am I calling that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The section.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You could be gassed.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Could be gassed, there were selections going on. For example, to that group belonged the sealava, yeah, b-b-b-B1C, B2B -- B -- B1 -- B2B, that was a Czech camp, was a Gypsy camp.</p><p>The C lagers of Czech camps, the Gypsy camp, both camps -- both parts of the women's camp, BIA and B1B, but they were -- that was a -- no, that was -- forget about BIA and B1B, that was the main women's camp, and all others belonged to us, to BIA, and B1B, up to the women's camp. So, I'm giving you here a small example why -- yeah, and they were all administered by the women's camp -- camp office.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="45"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Sections. The section -- what, everything was?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Everything, both sections, and had to report every day to the roll call -- for the roll call, to our camp office. We were the leading administrative entity --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- for the women's camp. It was not the Shtopskaboidas --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- they were an bloody, unimportant, but Laura Shelly brought an -- was giving the impression if they would have been headquarters of everything. They were the SS headquarters, yeah. And they -- there was no cola -- col -- cooperation or camaraderie among those SS secretaries, whatsoever. I have no idea how to explain that to the Whitman girl. He misunderstood the whole -- she had -- she was, what you are calling in German, spinning, yeah.</p><p>Now, is that clear, what I explained to you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yes, but not --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Is that new? Is that new?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes, that's -- that -- you haven't said that to me before.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Huh?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You haven't said that to me before.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I never said it to you before.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No, no.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Of course I'd not.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: How else could I have said to you during all those years? But I hope that you understand now, better than you would have understood 10 years ago.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="46"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But explain something to me. Why -- why would there be a group of privileged prisoners from which there would never be a selection or a gassing? Why?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Don't ask me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You don't know?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't know. You couldn't ask any -- that -- you couldn't ask the system somewhere in Berlin why.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was actually so -- we were so sure that we helped our ca -- our friends to be transferred to those camps.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah. You were two yards away from crematorium five, and were not all -- and were not gassed. Where people had to come from Holland, and from France, and I don't know -- know where from, to -- to be gassed in that crematorium, while the camp around --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: They were not.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- two yards only, had never one case of selection, yeah. And we knew it, but very few in the camp office, maybe it was me and Katya, who knew what the real -- and that why we could help.</p><p>That why we were transferring friends constantly to those parts of -- of the camp where we knew they will never be exposed to the selection. Okay?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah. So, is --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Now, anything to say?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: About this?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Mm-hm. Is that -- that is now -- are you surprised what I told you, no?</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="47"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah, it's -- in one sense it's surprising, in another sense there -- there's some recognition that there was a certain kind of -- I don't -- I don't know whether I want to call it protection going on, if you had a certain standing. But that it would be particular commandos is a surprise to me.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. No, because [indecipherable] so few, that you did -- had no -- that means they didn't know who -- who was who, if you have an -- that -- what would mean to the SS? The headquarter SS, they can -- they had nothing to do with it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But in a certain way, this doesn't make any sense. Do you know what I mean?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, it's just --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Do you know what I mean? Not that the s -- the system doesn't make any sense.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The whole system didn't -- the whole system didn't make any sense.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So how did you -- how did you know? I mean, at what point did it become clear to you and Katya, that these are protected commandos?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: From the beginning.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: From the beginning? Because they didn't treat those people in the same way they were treating other people?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, we -- we -- we knew -- Katya was close to the top SS woman, o-or man who were in charge. What are you looking for?</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="48"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I'm just -- because the tape is going to stop.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah. No, we knew it. I don't -- I knew it. I didn't even investigated why I know it, where from. I knew it.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Look, I give you an example. In "43, we were tr -- always trying from the beginning, once I got into the -- into the -- with the position of the camp office, how I got into the pen -- office is another story.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, we'll talk about that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But, once I've been in, and I have noticed that there are no selections going on over there, yeah, in those camps -- in those part of the camp, we have started [indecipherable] I was running to Katya, Katya, I need a job, let -- let's transfer her, let's do that. So we did it. We have transferred the people to safeguard them, and to save them, yeah, into those comma -- into those work details. And only once in my lifetime, for which I'm even today very unhappy, is that very good friends of mine, in the beginning, when everything was still very bad, and the new art [indecipherable] work detail in -- of those branch camps were established, and among them, one was called Boody, and I have helped an lot of girls to go to Boody, because we knew it is one of the branch camps, and there were never selections in Boody. Unfortunately, some of the German kapos started to massacre the Jewish girls. But that had nothing to do with the system, yeah. And</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="49"></span> </p><p> there were -- I still have sometimes sleepless nights, because my best friends wouldn't be helped, yeah. They got killed. So what can I tell you? But that's the only place where they died -- the only time they died prematurely, and they were not killed by the SS. They were killed by German inmates who were in charge there, as kapos, and so on. You know the story of Boody.</p><p>But otherwise, you show me one camp -- sub-camp, where there were selections of those I have mentioned to you. Never.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did the women know when they got there, that that was the case, they su --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Pardon?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did the -- when the women got into these -- into this -- the branch camps --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: They understood?</p></p></dialogue>

And this charged the -- all other women, they were -- they were engaged, and got herself Katya, to become the rapport shabering. That means, you had an rapport fuhrer, or fuhrering to lead that, that was always an SS woman, or an SS man, and you had the inmate who was then the one who did the job.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And I have been, during those couple of weeks in September, hospitalized, because I had typhus, and all kinds of junk in my body. I was very sick. And the whole block was selected, just ready to be gassed. And I have been taken out as the only one from the whole selection of I don't know how many thousand, on that particular day, and transferred to the camp office. What is it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: There's the phone. We've now returned.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: We've now returned.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They transferred me immediately to the camp office.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="52"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Who -- who took you out?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The Drexler, and Katya was standing there. Yeah, who took me out? The camp leader, because his secretary was an friend of mine, and when she saw me there on that big heap of people to be -- just to be taken on the truck, she was running to him, and asking if he would help me. Because a couple of weeks before, I used to paint some numbers in his office, on the wardrobes for the individual SS men.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: But I haven't finished, because I -- I had to -- I was transferred to the hospital, and she was an -- an --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Was her name Honey Yaeger?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah. She -- she was -- she had an yellow and purple star, because she had an Jewish lover.</p><p>So --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And he was Mueller.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mueller.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, and his first name?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Ha -- I think -- no, I must look him up.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He only was two months there, two months in the camp.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And he was --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: He's a very -- very seldom that he is mentioned in any literature, but I --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And why do you think he responded to her, to hon -- to --  <span class="page-break" number="53"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because he knew me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: He knew you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And she -- he took -- he asked Shtevitz, was another famous SS man, to come over, and to check if I am capable to carry on with the work. And so he asked me several things to do, up and down the bed, and jumping over the -- what is it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: A pit? A ditch?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Ditches, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: A ditch.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Little he knew that I was an very sporty type, and that I was used to go up and down the ladder, yeah. For me, all that, even as sick as I've been, was no big deal, yeah. So I passed everything he wanted me to do.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Even though you weren't feeling well.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Huh?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Even though you were not feeling well.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was very sick.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: There comes the man who was in charge of the selection, and of the whole business then, on that day, that was that Heinrich Schwartz, another SS man, an ugly one. And so when Stevitz told him that this Mueller want me to -- out, he said, okay, only if I have no fever. So go to the -- they commanded me to go over to the hospital station, and there they had to measure my fever, my temperature. Now, I nearly collapsed, but they told me not to worry, because even if I have fever, they won't tell. They took me int -- so they were selecting the people, the whole barracks, complete, even the blockelteste went. And -- no I don't think some of the blockelteste -- no, they</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="54"></span> </p><p> -- no, they left the blockelteste behind. But what happened is that -- that Schwartz wacom -- was coming every five minute. Has she fever, or hasn't she? He was so concerned about one person, yeah. And they constantly said, she is not ready yet, not ready. They were pumping in me some medication, Bydrian, I remember that, and Anna Weiss was the physician.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Anna Weiss?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: All -- Olly was there, Gerda Sneider, the whole hospital hierarchy, they just assured me they will not say that I have fever. And finally, when -- when he returned, and everybody was already gone, so he was just waiting for me, so when they ask him -- when he asked if I have fever, they said no, okay? And there was an SS man, who witnessed the whole business inside the hospital compound. And he was coming then, and brought me pen, and a piece of paper, and said sit down and do some drawing, start to work. So I s -- I was totally deaf, and blind, and I couldn't remember the letters, how they looked. I was tot -- look, I was out of the world, with high fever.</p><p>So I said, "But I don't know how the letter looks." He said, "Do whatever you want." You know, if I would have today be able to keep that, what I draw, it would have been a wonderful analysis for some of those psychiatrists, yeah. The results of my -- the condition, and the results of my whole situation, and what I did. In any case, the moment all everything was gone, I had my -- yeah, and the SS man said to me, "Look, do anything you want, but just work." So okay, I did -- I don't know what I did, but after awhile the door opens, in comes Katya, and [indecipherable] and Drexel, with an sheet of paper in the hand to transfer into the camp office. And that was the beginning of my career. Two months later, Mandel arrived as an oboffsairen, yeah, in charge of the whole camp, and Mandel cat -- was really -- respected me from the first day on, and made my life very tolerable. Her boyfriend was in charge of the bowlightung of the camp -- building</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="55"></span> </p><p> office, yeah. And he established me my drawing office. He supplied me with wonderful instruments, and material, and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: What did she see in you?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Huh?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: What did she see in you, do you think? Why --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I was the one who was [indecipherable] it's the only one, and she didn't know why. The only one from the whole thousands and thousand of people, yeah. And she couldn't -- she didn't know why.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: She didn't know why.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: She didn't know why. But they --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: How -- how was she with other people? Was she a very cruel person?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: She was an very beautiful woman. I wouldn't say she was cruel, no. But she didn't like the prostitutes, the German prostitutes. She didn't liked -- she liked -- I don't know what she liked. I don't know why she liked me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But sh -- but she liked you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I will never forget -- yeah, I helped to organize the orchestra too, during -- under her -- under her time. When she noticed that I'm artist by profession, that I'm a musician, so she -- she -- and I spoke good German, and so once she called me and asked me to put an dedication in an book.</p><p>So th -- I noticed she made another SS man an birthday present, but normally, I don't know what people are -- what the SS was giving each other. She made him a present of books. So I was starting to think, yeah, that was one quality which I never expected, yeah. And asking me to put an dedication in. And on that day, I noticed -- I said, but [indecipherable] that is my birthday too, yeah, on the same day. So she said, "Oh, so go [indecipherable] you have an sheet of paper, go to  <span class="page-break" number="56"></span> </p><p> the package room, and get yourself the biggest parcel they have." Yeah. And do you know who was in charge then, already, in the package room? That SS woman who --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Who slapped you?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Who so she started to respect me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You too. What was Drexel like?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Ugly. Oy, was she ugly. And she want -- she ask me -- Katya is standing there, and I was coming, and walking, and she called me back. You're short -- your dresses are too short. I want to see you tomorrow with I don't know how many inches longer, and wanted to hit me. And I was running away. I don't know what happened to -- she could have shot me, yeah. And Katya c-comes later on and said, "Sippy, you know she -- she complained that Sippy's [indecipherable]." She was running away from me, and I wanted to hit her. So, I don't know what Drexel was. She was -- I noticed that she did selections, she participated in selections, while Mandel did not. But Mandel once signed an sheet of selected paper, and because of that she was hanged. So.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Uh-huh. [inaudible]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Look, it was an very hard -- well, it was very hard to understand, what really went on in the mind of the -- that Mandel woman, that she had, as an partner, an h-high official, and an trained - - an engineer -- an engineer by profession, or an architect. And she -- as I had mentioned to you, that was an sign of -- on bit of an higher level -- mentally higher level than all others, while giving another SS man a book as an present, yeah, for a birthday. But would -- how would you have judged that? That they were thinking different.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Differently.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="57"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: She was from Austria, but with her, I had good luck. In -- at the end of 44, there was an friend. The Germans wanted to establish the biggest women's concentration camp in the world, in -- not too far from Dachau, yeah, in Kaufering. And we have heard about it, and Mandel should have become the biggest shot -- big shot of the biggest concentration camp on earth. So sh-she selected some of the Auschwitz people which she wanted to take along with her, and nobody from the camp office, and nobody knew what's going to happen, whom she's going to take. It would have been an advantage, because there would have been no crematorium, yeah. So they prepared a list whom she selected in the camp office. We had one typewriter, and one woman typed the list. So I wanted to know if I am on the list, because it was, after all, an big event to leave Auschwitz, and join the staff of the biggest SS woman in the world. And -- but the woman who produced the list was mean, and didn't wanted to tell us. So, what am I doing, the list was prepared, and it went to Berlin. And while she was carrying the list to deliver the list, I went into the wastepaper basket, and there were some carbon paper. So I've been on the list.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And Katya was on the list?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Katya was already gone, because she had an affair with an SS man, and was -- disappeared from the earth of -- from the face of the earth. Katya was stupid, because I didn't know that she had the affair. He was coming there to the office to visit, every day. And I went over to Katya, and I said, "Katya, who is he? Who is he?" What is -- no, I did-didn't said who is he. "Katya, what is he doing here?" She said, "He's coming to visit me." Her. I said, "Katya, that's an mass murderer." She looked at me. I noticed him shu -- sh -- killing the people at the black wall, from</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="58"></span> </p><p> I visited while still in Auschwitz, I went from block nine to block 10. There are still today the wooden -- wooden timbers, yeah. But in between the timbers you could look. And I have witnessed the execution of hundreds and hundreds of people, which he performed. And I said to her, "Katya, that's a mass murderer." She never said anything to me. Our relationship went -- slowly cooled off, yeah, because of that. And then she was arrested, put into the bunker, and was sent away, and he was sent to the front. So nothing really happened between the two of -- he was killed, and she was stupid enough to risk her good life she had. She had an important -- she had an important life to car -- to -- to lead in Auschwitz. She could help, she could do a lot of things.</p><p>And all for an SS man who was really a mass murderer. But I'm glad that I told her that in my lifetime. I was honest enough to forewarn her, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And what happened to her in the end?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: She died.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: She died. In Auschwitz? Or she was sent away?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, she -- she was sent away, but she survived. We have met after the war.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: She visited me, I visited her in "75 in Prague, but she died of an -- of an kidney failure.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you talk about it after the war? What she was -- what she had done?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, every second that I have -- I have on record -- not a record, a tape.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tape?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: [have sent Susan --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="59"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- over to visit her, and she didn't wanted to speak to anybody, but when I told her that I'm sending somebody and she remembers Susan a little bit.

And then Mandel one day ask her -- even what's his name, Lankban describes the whole affair in his book, too. One day, Mandel ask her if she would forgive her. So both were Catholics. She said, "Look, why are you asking me? I forgive you, but He upstairs, it's up to Him." So that was authentic, and she told me the story, too.</p><p>Rachwalova was her name.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I'm helping to establish the -- the camp office --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- by designing the card -- cardex for different purposes. We had an cardex system for the living, an cardex system for the dead, an cardex system for the -- for the work details. Then there were many functions in that -- in the camp office, like again, the principle bookkeeping. People were engaged by collecting daily dartas of nationalities so that they could supply me for my diagram, and for the statistics which I had to -- of whi-- of which I have been engaged on an daily basis. There were many functions and many employees in that office, but I could start -- I mean, we had to -- I established the individual barrack books which each blockelteste -- I think Mrs. -- what's her name? S -- Sheila Romiano [indecipherable]. Well, you interviewed Palarchik.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: She made an enormous mistake when she said they were keeping a book for nationalities, a book for professionals, a book for -- by number, and a book by names. Now, as I have been in charge of putting the columns, and making the columns in those books, because they were blank sheets in the book, I don't remember ever to have supplied four books to each barrack.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Each barrack.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was one book, where we had the columns, yeah. Now -- and because of that, I engage sometimes, people to help, and to draw those columns, and to mark the different columns. Peop - - mainly people who were discharged from hospital and needed time to recuperate, and then time to be transferred to a m -- kind of an good job. So that -- there were so many people who went through that drawing office, just in the stage of recup -- of re -- to recuperate, yeah. So it was quite -- very satisfying. Among others, what's her name, Susan was working there with us, too, while she was just out of hospital. That how we met, actually, in Birkenau. Okay? Now you know, Susan Chernakshpatz.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Because what you originally told me --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- was that the work detail was where the cardex of all the skills.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Correct.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So that's work detail.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Work detail.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But the work service was where they --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: One person. And actually, the li -- liaison between employer, and -- and employees. That means the companies or individuals who requested the service, went through the one person.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That person in the work service.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Work service, they say --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So they would say I need 50 road workers.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So the work service went to the arbides einsatz, and said select al -- your specialists of your people who can do or perform the job, yeah. Because she had no -- you see, the work service had the request for 50 people who can do road work, okay?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right, right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: She went to the work detail office.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: To say who can do it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And ask, get me 50 people. The work detail office went to the individual barracks, because they had in their cardex the road workers, good road workers. Where are they? They're there, in there. And had contact -- made contact with the blockelteste, and ask them to send so and so, and so and so, and so and so next morning, until they had the 50 together.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="72"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: But the work service did other things, too, which is not really defined. She made all kinds of jobs, she made all kinds of other things, yeah. After all, you had to do a job for -- for hundred and thousand of inmates to -- to administer on every possible level, like food and -- and clothing, and -- and in -- it was -- it's co -- a complicated business --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Well, it's -- yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- but if it comes -- now, let's forget about the logistic, let's do the work of -- of how to supply the work force to the employers, yeah, who are requested. [indecipherable] requested.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: All right, so they request 10 people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They request.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: They go to the work service and say, "I need 10 people." The work --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Ah, no, it could have happened that they went to the work -- they went to the head -- work service got the order, yeah, 10 people tomorrow morning, in from dobseldor.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: She made sure that the right people were selected out of the cardex, and out of the availability of surplus.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, it would move -- the request goes to the work service. She made -- I'm just talking about this one piece of it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay? She will then go to the work detail where the cardex exists. Let's say they need 10 tailors.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: They need something very specific.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="73"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Correct, correct.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So they will look through the cardex --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Mm-hm.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- find 10, say here are the names, or do they --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, no.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- they say we will --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, she -- she will go and ask for 10 tailors.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: When do you need them? Tomorrow morning. They went to the different barracks --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- selected -- got the 10 tailors, according to their cardex and names and numbers, and have asked the blockelteste to bring those 10 tailors tomorrow morning in front of the camp office, or wherever [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right. Now, would the people in the work detail --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Wait a minute, then --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Oh okay, all right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- the 10 people, marching out the door to their destiny, which they received by the work service person, yeah. The work detail did only the administrative job. The work service physically delivered the people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. And there was a specific place that the was -- that these 10 people were told to go?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah. And [indecipherable] door, and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: [indecipherable] and wait there until the person from the work service came and said, this is your -- this is where you're going.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="74"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Correct. Because she requested it, and she got it, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right, okay. Now, when the work detail looks in the cards.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do they have to go through Katya before they go to the head of the -- to the blockelteste or not?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Of course, they had to go through our cardex, and either to transfer the people to other barracks, to other places, to other sub-camps, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right, because you have to be able to -- to --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: They had to be delivered to the -- to the -- they had to be made available to the people who re- requested the services, yeah. Now, that could have been on transfer to another camp, or just to be available every morning, through the blockelteste, make her responsible that those people will be ready every morning, until they are going to can -- be cancelled, or until they die. And that was one of the responsibilities of some blockelteste too, that if they had to be -- if they were selected for an particular job, an -- or an -- a steady job, to be there, yeah. Once they have been told to supply those 10 people every day, they had to stick to the request. There was a b -- v -- from the moment a blockelteste was involved with Katya, our office was involved, too.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: [inaudible] Hm. Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It's very hard to -- it was -- those situations have changed constantly. But the -- it is true that - - but if you were an real professional, and there were certain work details -- constant work details, that -- that the -- that was an routine -- it became routine, yeah. Of certain work details had an certain number, yeah. So they were registered as a work detail under that -- in that number. 10 people, and sometimes only eight could come, because two were sick, so she had to engage again two more.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="75"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Two more, right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Through the same process, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right, right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Look, it was not simple.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. No, I understand that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. It was not simple, and each -- really, it's hard to believe that in an group of so many people with different situations, and different backgrounds, that we had manage -- that we have managed to bring law and order into the place. And there were times then, that we have managed to -- to supply everybody with his ration. Those times were gone that we were coming home from an outdoor work and the blockelteste told you, ""We have no more food for you." Yeah.</p><p>That never occurred under Katya. Rations were supplied, we had -- or they arranged special rations. Katya really made what she could in the time of counting the work -- the -- time of counting the -- during the roll call time was cut down to an s -- minimum amount of time, yeah, and that meant more relaxation, more sleep.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I was going to get into this, but go ahead. Go ah --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: What?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- go, continue.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah, that is all what I'm trying to say, that it was not so simple how people think, and to manage an -- and t-to manage the food distribution, the clothing distribution, the bedding, you name it, all s -- s -- clothing ides, including shoes. That is -- was not -- was -- became always, during those years or th-those months, improved, improved enormously, yeah. Then we had enormous [indecipherable] blacks of Hungarian Jews in the four -- middle of "44, and so on. That was an big problem, yeah, but as they were sep -- as those newcomers there, there was a lot of</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="76"></span> </p><p> movement. Newcomers were coming, and old-comers were sent on transport, because they were requested in factories in Germany. A lot of people had been requested, but also a lot of movement, and we had to account for each person, and the roll calls again became more complicated, but the system improved by sticking to it well, and -- and selecting more intelligent blockelteste, and block administrators, so it was always the tendency of improvement, and of [indecipherable] re -- raising the standard of living [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: In spite of -- in spite of the fact that you're in a situation that is meant for people to die?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right. We had to carry on.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And we did not believe for one moment to give up, yeah. Never. That was an ama -- that I have learned to survive. Even now, I can be half dead, and if I have a -- an job to do, I'm doing it. But we -- we were carrying on, not knowing if you are going to live tomorrow, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Sippy, can you list the functions that the works -- th -- I understand that work detail only took down the cardex of information. But the work service seems to be more complicated, and the camp office has many more different functions.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: The camp office seemed to -- is the largest --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- and the much more com --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Correct.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- complex of all three, right?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We had to di -- we had to control the punishment detail. We had to control the supply of not only -- it was not enough to ask for people, and to supply the people for work, but it was an</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="77"></span> </p><p> question of, as I said, food rations, clothing, bedding, hygiene, cleaning of the barracks, cleaning of each bed, a -- delousing, de -- and we had to -- we had to work very closely with the work detail people. The work service had very little to do with the rest of those functions. They only have supplied upon the request, those people they have -- that was an request for people, and they had to supply, and nobody could care less how we did it, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Or how they did it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right, right. Is Canada, the hospital sauna, also under the camp office?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Canada is an work detail, had -- the camp office -- not the camp office.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Not?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Or the work detail office, had any influence on any -- on any work detail.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So Canada had nothing to do with the camp office?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Wait a minute. Canada was one of many.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Are you talking about the Canada camp?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Camp, or the work detail?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No, no, no. No, the work detail.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Work detail. One work detail m-more or less. Why Canada? Why have you selected Canada?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: No, no, no, I'm just asking, are there --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Th -- nothing special, they were just another work detail. They had their -- now, in those different work details, you had an structure. You had the oberkapo, under -- underkapo, for-  <span class="page-break" number="78"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> foremen, and all kinds of functions. So Canada was just one of a work -- but just one among many work details.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: All right, so, but then, what I'm trying -- what I'm trying to do is figure out what -- what is the function of the camp office?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It's to oversee all of the work -- no. You explain it, I'm not there, you're ex -- you explain it to me. If you have to say to someone who doesn't know anything, what is the camp office supposed to be doing? They have a number of different functions, right?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Now, can you imagine that you have s -- hundreds of barracks, correct?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You have, first of all, the camp office had to administer all sub-camps, and branch camps, yeah. We're that start.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: All sub-camps and branch camps, okay. Let's -- let's --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: So ther --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- let me -- let me turn the tape.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p>End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: This is tape number three, side -- tape number three, side B, United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Helen Tichauer on September seventh, 2000. Okay.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Now, let's start with the main procedure. The very most important function in all concentration camps, were the daily roll call. Once or twice. Now, to have individual branch  <span class="page-break" number="79"></span> </p><p> camps, individual sub-camps, or what -- service camps, or whatever I am calling that, had to be roll called every day, okay?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: To do that, you had to report every day, once or twice, and every day once or twice, hours and hours were spent on the roll call. Now, if the come -- if the people were, during the roll call time, in the camp, or working outdoors, or working outside, it made no difference. The amount of the people had to coincide with the estimated amount which was set every day. We had -- that was an very complicated and important, quote unquote, thing. Only [indecipherable] to be busy, or to be engaged was already a -- a -- a big job, the roll call. Hours and hours [indecipherable] you had to prepare the food intake and distribution, which -- I mean, the distribution was done by the individual blockelteste, but you had to order it, you had to request it, every day. How could you do that? According to the roll call. The roll call -- you had -- for the roll call incoming transports, outgoing transports, transfers from hospital, to the -- to the camp, from the camp to the hospital.</p><p>The dying, the corpse, the gassing. It was an constant report on check control and check control, yeah. You had only the relationship between the hospital compound, and the releases, and the requests for transfers from the camp to the hospital, from the hospital to the camp. There were functions which involved with the cardex system. People were dying, out of the living cardex, into the dead cardex. There were reports to be written daily, on certain thing which they requested by headquarters. I had -- I myself had an lot of work to do, which I cannot explain right now. You had the interaction between the work detail office, and the camp office, due to those movements, they are already an full time job, yeah. And it had to be exact, and n -- we couldn't -- you could not afford to have one person mislaid or misplaced, yeah. So that was an very, very ups -- painstaking, or how do you call that? Painstaking?</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="80"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Event, and we were always concerned about one thing. God forbid some -- the figures don't coincide. That means the whole night to stand until the figures -- until the -- the figures are right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So that was not our fault, it -- the SS, the idiotic system, to build the whole, everything on that roll call business was taking -- was keeping us busy for hours and hours and hours, daily. What can I tell you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Why do you th -- why do you think so many survivors, who were in Auschwitz --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- do not remember, or do not know that there was a difference between roll calls at one time or another. All of them seem to talk about long roll calls.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Wait a minute. I don't understand your question. Why do I se --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Most -- most -- most aus -- Auschwitz survivors --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- who were ordinary prisoners, when they talk about roll call, they never talk about short roll calls. They only talk about long roll calls. Why do you -- why do you think that that's so, when what you have is a very clear memory that the roll calls got shorter as time went on.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Of course.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Not longer.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because we improved that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But why do you think -- do -- do you think that they're --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because they have no memory, and they cannot distinguish the time -- span of time. But we had our -- our stopwatch, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> <span class="page-break" number="81"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And we were counting [indecipherable] working with a stopwatch, to -- to eliminate, and to improve the roll call.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can you explain how you improved it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Of course.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I know you've explained it to me before, but do it again.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: By being more efficient, by -- by preparing the roll calls in an -- with an special system of -- of pre -- pre-roll call -- pre-roll call report.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You -- we knew at evening, preparing the whole business that in the morning, barrack so and so, after the transfers were made from the barrack to the hospital compound, and from the barrack to an transport waiting at the railway station, and from that barrack on transfer to I don't know where, and the same barrack receiving so and so many from the hospital, and receiving so and so many newcomers, must be 24, yeah? And in the morning, those 24 report -- were reported by preparing that the whole evening, yeah. So we have, before the roll call in the morning, every -- it was an system we established, every block administrator reported an hour earlier, we will have 24 people on our barrack, yeah?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So when the roll call people were coming to count, they knew there must be 24. They were not counting how many were there, but there had to be 24. That -- we have called that an forappelle. [indecipherable] the appelle, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So they were simply verifying what the report said.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Pardon?</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="82"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: They were verifying what the report said.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: What report?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: The -- the pre-report. The pre --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: The pre-report, they were very find what the pre-report said.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What -- as opposed to just counting?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And there was nobody missing. Couldn't.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So that already had eliminated the unnecessary forward and backwards, and shifting and running, and -- and guessing, yeah. We had everything prepared every evening. It was an full time job of an whole staff.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Including the -- the -- it's so people don't have the slightest idea what went on.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Bef-Before you would do these reports --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- what were they count -- I mean, i-if they didn't -- it's interesting.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Th-They didn't know what they are doing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: If they didn't know -- they di -- they didn't know what they were doing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So how -- what were they counting for? They were simply counting, and -- but they didn't know what they were getting.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Correct. And if that was Katya who introduced all the whole system, we once went on with an stopwatch, and discovered that the highlights of one counting, took only three minutes. You know how many lives they save? How many people could relax instead to suffer in the snow, in  <span class="page-break" number="83"></span> </p><p> the heat? Now whatever the survivors are telling you, they have no idea. I'm telling you, they have no idea, our researchers have no idea. As I said, Yergen never entered an German concentration camp. Is he an expert now on concentration camp? Had -- what's her name, of the woman Nerhamatek writes books now on concentration camp, has no ideas what's an concentration camp is. So you cannot always rely on the which -- on -- on the so-called experts, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You have to go deeper, and ask them to -- to look in -- to do what you are doing right now.</p><p>It's not easy to work with you. It's not easy to answer your questions, don't you think so?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I don't know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Only you can judge that.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But I don't know if -- if you understand what I am saying.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No, I think I do understand what you are saying.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Good.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And the effect on the SS, they were -- they were glad not to be outside either.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They were glad to go home, to be able to go home, yeah. There was less beating, and less -- less -- less of everything, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, I remember when we were discussing this when Irwin was alive. And he described the men's camp as creating chaos.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: How?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And the women's camp as creating organization, and that it was a very different way.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="84"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Okay, but it was not always, yeah? They couldn't afford to do that always, because eventually they got tired of it, yeah. And the people [indecipherable] they created that was just for awhile, while they were newcomers, and they were new -- numerologists, yeah?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And I don't know what. But that was not an constant habit. They couldn't afford to do that all the time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: All the time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But that was something that they wanted to do, and that was not what the women wanted to do.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Ha -- the women, they were [indecipherable]. The women were just happy to go to bed, to go to sleep. That was never on our mind to -- to make things complicated during that time. You don't know how hard it was for us. We were still -- no. Why the man did it, they were -- man is a religious man. They were crazy, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: They were not allowed to count. You know Jews --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- are not allowed to be counted --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- and things like that. It was not an very heroic act whats is com -- what they committed there. But after awhile that disappeared, that disappeared. We had all kinds of situations. In the beginning, everybody wanted to together with her sisters, her mother with her, cousins. But then</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="85"></span> </p><p> they have learned that -- that the appelle is not an social gathering, yeah. Have learned it very quickly. Anything else, please? Carry on.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You once said to me that the SS did not have any control over the camp office.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It didn't?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Huh?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You guys created the rules? How -- how could it be that they didn't have control over you?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And when --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: She just wanted results, yeah. They couldn't care less what we are doing, as long as they got what they needed. So results, as long as Mandel had from me, at the end of each month, a beautiful made diagram with 18 or 20 different curves, which went to -- over to -- to Berlin, she couldn't care less when I did that, how I did that, why I did it. She once caught me in the middle  <span class="page-break" number="86"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> of the after -- of an afternoon in bed, while making an surprise visit to the barrack, and I was in bed, yeah. But I was known -- "Wh-why are you here?"

And sometimes the SS  <span class="page-break" number="87"></span> </p><p> was coming in at -- to those who were in charge, at night, cause there was lights in the barrack.</p><p>So they just got -- got used to it that I'm working at night.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: 14 months.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So how do you -- to what do you attribute the change? Do you have any idea?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. I started to eat differently, yeah. I had mixed my camp food with an little bit of self- cooked food.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And where did you get that food from?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [had a girlfriend with whom I worked together, and all she did, she -- we had our bread rations in -- divided into one part to eat, and one part to exchange for potatoes, that's all. And the potatoes we have mixed an little bit with margarine, which we obtained. So we were eat -- the feeling that you can eat -- that you are eating a little bit differently, yeah, contributed to your well-being. It was nothing special. Then we had parcels received. I -- I had two rations from the special rations from the orchestra, and the camp office. And there were fruits and there were  <span class="page-break" number="92"></span> </p><p> other goodies, yeah. Those special rations, special parcels which people were receiving from the parcel section, from the pack -- package room, because there were all good things, they brang things which we did not had before, in the beginning. So I had that. Then this -- we have received from Switzerland, the Slovakian girls, there was by some of the organizations, of the Czech organizations, they paid through -- in Switzerland they purchased sardines, yeah. We received those sardines, we received some chocolate from time to time, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. Th -- there is even a description of the organization who sponsored that. They had to pay for each person who was deported. They had to supply and buy, even if they were alive or no -- if they were di -- regardless if they are alive or not. The SS collected all the dead people's parcels, but those who were alive were -- received the parcels. So every -- every little bit added to -- to the body's re-recovery, yeah. And that was among [indecipherable] reason, but you know I even menstruated when we went on the Death March, with heavy cramps.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So when you were in the camp office, how did you take care of the period physically? Did they -- did they have --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah, the --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- certain --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- the package -- not package, but clothing barrack, yeah, had -- not --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Napkins?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And did other women in the camp office also get their period, or was it -- did it vary? Did you know?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You know what?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You didn't know?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Uh?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: That's interesting, because there's such a -- a -- so many women mention --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- that they didn't get their period.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Nothing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, but then when things became a little bit easier and better -- emotionally it was an very lifting -- morally, I mean, it was an very important thing to know that -- that you have a little bit of an better food intake than you had before. In the beginning, I mean, I had all kinds of up -- I was so sick. There is no ailment I did not went through without medical treatment. And I survived, and then with better food, you [indecipherable] hoping -- do you know that my friends from Bratislava, from my city -- a gir -- I had a girlfriend who was half Jewish. She was at home, and when I have learned that the German post office is functioning vair, and parcels are arriving to non-Jewish prisoners from their home in Germany, I made it my business to write a letter, because we were able to write from time to time cards, post cards. I wrote to one of my friends</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="94"></span> </p><p> who was half Jewish and half German, to send me -- to -- oh no, not to send me, but to greet -- to send my greetings to two people. They were not people, but they were -- one was an butcher shop, with the delicatessen shop, and the other one was an cake shop. So I have sent the greetings, to send me greetings through Petrizharka. Petrizharka was a city at the border where I've -- see, I'm -- they understood that to go over with the parcels of -- of -- the greetings were the parcels I mentioned that I want some food. They went over to the city on the border, Austrian border, and mailed me exactly what I -- like -- instructions I was giving, send me greetings through so and so. I received parcels from them with good food, with clothing, with you name it, and it functioned, yeah. So, they handed that over to me, because the SS woman in charge, who was hitting me, was all of a sudden respecting me because -- you know, I told you why.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And later on it became unimportant, because we had so many good packages, that those mussels and mustard were not -- no value whatsoever.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right, right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In the beginning, when there was nothing, it was very helpful.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. Okay. Let me ask you a little bit about how the hospital, in so far as you know, how the hospital was run in the women's camp. Do you know?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't wanted to know, I don't want to know. I had no good relationship with the hospital administration because they were Poles, and were Polish women, and anti-Semitic. But some of the doctors I have known, and I've kept touc -- in touch with them up -- up til now. I am in touch with Dr. Schreiberwined, I'm in touch with Emma Pronska, Emma Weiss, and some of the nurses, but I tried to keep out of sight, because it was an very infectious -- infectious en- environment, so I never entered the hospital if I had not -- had to -- I mean, I tried to avoid the hospital.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="101"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: The whole business. But they had their own systems, they had there every day the roll calls, they had to report to us every day, just like any other -- other sub-camp, to include the --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- strength of their patients, and bed runs, and so ex -- the bed runs, the transfer to the gas chamber, the transfers from the camp to the hospital, the transfers from the hospital to the camp, back again. So it was con -- in constant movement every day, every day, every day. It all went on the appelle sheet, yeah. On the roll call sheet.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And what did you know then about what was happening with pregnant women and the babies?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Pardon?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: What did -- wh -- at the time --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- what did you know about what was happening with pregnant women who were having babies, and what was going on with the killing of the babies?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Jews, or non-Jews?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Both.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Huh?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Both. What do you mean?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The Jewish -- non-Jewish women, they could keep the babies. The Jewish women who were pregnant upon arrival, or during the early st -- or post arrival time, were simply killed, with their babies. That was all far as I know. Then the Hungarians were coming, many of them were in -- pregnant in the early stages.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So they --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="102"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: There were abortions performed by the doctors, secretly, and that was all.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did the -- do you -- do you --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Huh?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did the women know that they were having abortions? Did they realize what was going on, or was --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: They wanted to have it.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: They wanted to have it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They wanted to have it, otherwise, how would it -- would the doctors have known that she is pregnant?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: How in heaven's name did they perform --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Huh?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- how did they perform abortions there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Mm, very simple, with everything -- they had everything for -- for instruments, and everything. That Dr. Pearl is telling lies in her description of how she aborted baby with the dirty fingernails on the floor, I mean, that's crazy. There was soap, there was everything. She didn't -- she made an joke out of the whole business.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And where did they do this?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In the hospital compound.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In the hospital they did it?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You once told me that the reports that you wrote for Berlin, you did them imaginatively and artistically.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Explain. Don't touch that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Why?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Why? How -- wh-what -- what's that mean, you did reports imaginatively?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Imaginative, no.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- if you have some material, if you have the colors, and if you know your graphics, and 1-if you know your graphics, you produce something which looks -- I would say easy to follow, easy to read, and with taste, yeah?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Professionally, maybe I s -- use the word professionally.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Maybe.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. That I would -- would have used. Of course, you've -- why not artistically? It was important that it is just an diagram, it's just like an composition. If -- if | want you to understand</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="104"></span> </p><p> something, I am using an simple dialog. If I can transfer the message through graphics, then you have to do that on the simplest, and most -- the best way to make your recipient feel good.</p><p>Because otherwise you get an feedback which can put you into trouble.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And they liked your reports?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Who should have complimented me? They were letting me live. You know th-they liked my work, because again I'm telling you the lover of Mandel was in th -- in charge of the architectural office of Auschwitz, now -- and Birkenau. And h-he always -- I'm sure that -- and Mandel, with that monthly report, was always very proud, and she could -- she received probably from him several compliments, and she never -- they never objected to anything.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did writing these reports depress you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Huh?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did you come up, or why did you come up with the idea of making a model of ow -- of the women's camp? Did you just come up with that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I tell you. I had an desk, working desk like that, big like that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Like a -- like a kitchen table -- like a dining room table?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And every time an SS man was asked to go to a certain barrack, he was -- they were coming to the camp office to ask where the barrack is, yeah? Now, then they have sent them to me, I should tell. So, after awhile I've decided --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You were the tourist office.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="109"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. After awhile I've decided I'm going to make an -- with a pencil, an plan on the desk -- top of the table, to put in those blocks, how they are located, with everything in the scale from one two. So I measured out the whole camp, and everything, and made myself a line drawing with pencil, on the top of the desk, and put the number of the block in. So when an SS man was coming, and asking where is the block, I told him I could show him immediately where it is. So when I noticed it worked so nicely, I had the plan flat on my desk, I said I'm going to build the barracks, and in colors exactly, and I'm going to make an little model, without asking anybody.</p><p>The material I had, and when I started, and Mandel once visited, and thought what I'm -- and saw what I am doing, she said [indecipherable] and Hessler was there. "Carry on, you can do anything, you can measure out whatever you want. But, don't include the crematorium. You can put anything on, but no crematorium." Okay. So I engaged in little -- Hans [indecipherable] was an architectural student in Poland, or in France, and we are started to build that nice little model.</p><p>It was so nice we made [indecipherable] barbed wire, everything was on. So -- soil, glued -- put the glue on, and sprinkled sand on so it stuck. I made an professional model, okay, out of the camp. Now, then I had an friend who was one of the Polish underground workers. He was an electrician, and him I engaged to put me in front of the entrance an little barb, electric barb like an -- like an -- what we had over there, and underneath I had the battery, and so when you touched the two things, the camp was illuminated, yeah. Was an good model, very professional.</p><p>Then, one nice day they were -- put me on an glass top on that, and were taking it out to the commandant, Hesse, into his office. That was the end of it. Do you know it's possible that it is still standing somewhere.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Somewhere.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And what I did, I put my number, I marked the model with my number.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="110"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, you did.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It's signed.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did you paint it --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Huh?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- so it was really -- it looked really professional, you painted it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did you put people in it, too, or just the --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No. So you didn't have any -- did anyone take pictures of it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Who?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I don't know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Who, we? Of the inmates?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No, no, no, no, no.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [have no idea what they did. But every time, whenever somebody was visiting, an high official, instead to -- what they did in prior years, to demonstrate how people are getting 25 on their buttocks, they brought the high officials into my office, and showed him the -- the model, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes, you said that, that rather than watching somebody being beaten, that this became a substitute.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Isn't that strange"?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="111"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Why?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, I don't know. How does one substitute -- this was a way of entertaining them?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because -- look, I don't know, it happened that -- it turned out that it was very beneficial for the camp, that there was never -- there was never again, since I made the model, they had -- you see, they were showing off with something always, but nobody ever performed the 25 since then.</p><p>They were proud of their model, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So they wanted to show that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Isn't that funny?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Strange.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. I don't even know what high officials I had in that drawing office, because there were really a lot of very important looking people. I know one thing, Hitler wasn't there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But, with those primitive SS people, I once made a joke, but it was not a joke, it turned out to be a very good -- good weapon. They always asked me, "What kind of an profession do you have?" I did that, I did that, what kind of a pro -- I said, "The same like your fuhrer." Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did they keep quiet then?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Can you imagine? No, we are laughing now, but it was --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- for me then, I -- I tried to -- to keep those people out of my way. Same profession as your fuhrer. Son of a bitches. Now, what can I tell you? Any other question, or are you too tired?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. Well let me -- let me ask you something.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: What is it -- what -- what is it about the structure of Auschwitz that you th -- the women -- the women's camp, that you think most ordinary prisoners who went through --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> <span class="page-break" number="114"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- and are being interviewed, don't understand?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I can't tell you --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Is it everything?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- it's very -- it's not Auschwitz only. Let's compare -- and I like to compare Auschwitz with the present civilian environment, yeah?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because we are living in a normal life, in a normal environment. Who f -- f -- I mean, New York is an big city, but a little village, a little -- an borough, whatever community, what does the ordinary person know about the structure of the city hall? In spite of the fact that we have television performance, exposure, we know that people can come and discuss it, and present their problems, and there's a group of people, com-committees, and so on, who are listening, who are going ahead, and are engaged in problem solving, and betterment of certain malfunctions, t- trying to help, and to make life more bearable. But who -- who knows how -- how the system works? Who knows the mechanics? Now why should the ordinary person in Auschwitz have known the mechanics of the camp, or the camp leadership? Why are we expecting that? Only those who were engaged, or are engaged today in city hall business will know, and know, and know how to go ahead, and how to conduct the certain sessions, and how to conduct the leadership. I mean, how to engage in the leadership, and what to do. The ordinary -- I don't know what the -- how they are -- how it works. And there's no plan of -- of s -- simplified to explain to the public, not even who is who. And who -- who's -- who is doing what. Wh-Why do we expect -- know that ev-every ordinary, poor, ex, dirty, stinky inmate, hungry, half-dead musselman, should know what happened in Birkenau, and in Auschwitz? Is that an answer?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's a good answer.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="115"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Good.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But let me -- let me ask you it in a -- in a different way.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: It's one thing for ordinary people --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- not to know exactly what the structure is, and -- in any kind of detail.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: It's another thing for them to not know that there's any structure. So -- so, a lot of people, certainly before I met you --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- many years ago --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- I never -- it could be my stupidity, of course --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- as opposed to anything else, but I never thought that there was -- I never thought about a structure. Di -- di -- do you know what I mean? And I think that that's true, I think that's true for a lot of people, el -- over the years.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Good, we were prisoners.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right, right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah? There is a prison system in the United States.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Who knows about the prison system? Who ask about it? Who cares about it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="116"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah? The prisoners themselves, today, they're interested in one thing, to have food, to have medical care, to -- not to e -- be exposed to brutality by their guards, but -- and some of them may be interested in the jury leg -- jury -- legal system, yeah?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And learn more about the law, and they have a chance to -- even to study, but how many of those people will, after their sentence, be engaged in the cil -- in civil law? Just few who are interested. And same thing as here. Those who survived and were -- became interested later on, what really happened to them, they have learned, and they know a little bit more than the average person. But they participated in one thing, all of those -- of those who -- who are able to speak out. They mu-must remember how they were -- how they were perform -- not perform, transform from being an civilian into an inmate. They remember, even if a little bit, and not everything, how they -- what happened to them when they were stripped naked, when they were shaved, yeah, when they were registered maybe, yeah. Then driven into an barrack, and all those basic things, they have remembered them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right, right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They remember they had an blockelteste.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. No, you're right, you're right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah? Now what -- why must they remember anything else what they never ec -- never -- they were never exposed to anything else, yeah?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, right, yeah, you're right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: So it is not just the people don't know, they were never exposed to anything. And they were interested in one thing, to sleep and to eat. They were the two enemies, sleeplessness, I mean --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And starvation.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="117"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- the lack of the chance to sleep enough, and to eat enough. And s -- hygiene, and then comes medical facilities, let alone a medication, or well-being during an -- an roll call, yeah. The roll call was actually the center of everything. Everything was built around the roll call, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So food is built around the roll call?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Depended on the roll call, the food supply, if there were a thousand people, and you have received 900 rations, yeah, there was an problem. So as we mentioned yesterday, and I explained to you that the male prisoners -- the non-Jewish male prisoners, who were there much earlier than the Jewish prisoners, male and female, the male prison -- non-Jewish male prisoners were mainly ex-military people, fren -- from France, from each country. They knew what an roll call is, they knew that an -- the formation into five and all that, is of importance to make things easier and quicker, but the women did not understood, and the Jewish male, especially of the religious sect, did not understood, yeah. Now they think that they have committed an act of resistance, those idiots, yeah? That was no act of resistance, to -- to made it impossible to be counted, that was an k-killing situation. They were beaten, they were -- they have extended the duration of the roll call, and a -- the s -- it -- stupidity of they're not allowed to be counted, and all that, did not help, so again -- and we were not soldiers, the women were not soldiers, ex-soldiers, we didn't know what it meant in the beginning at least, and then later on, of course it -- we have learned what -- what the roll call is, but it was an torture, because we hadn't -- the people had no experience, they didn't understood. And everybody wanted to stand during a lo -- roll call with her sister, while moving forward, and backwards, and they were -- they had the ti -- never made any sense. They -- they did not understood, nobody's there to explain, yeah, so.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Di -- wh-when you -- when you f -- when you folks came up with your system of doing the roll call, the pre -- the pre-appelle.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="118"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you try to create a system where the blockelteste would explain to the women what you were doing, so that they wouldn't act in this chaotic way?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: The blockelteste, no. Th-There was told -- look, people in charge had certain obli -- had certain -- no -- had an obligation, certain obligation to tell the people, come out, we have to count you. Stand in fi -- in -- in five rows, yeah. Who had time, in an hungry, wild, hoard, th -- the -- it was an wild hoard of people, yeah, who had time to speak and to explain, and who was listening, yeah? There was an ordered, do that, yeah. If you didn't --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And ordered what?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- a order, do that, go stand in five --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- in perf -- in five of rows, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was the order. If you did it, fine. If not, you were hit. There was hitting going on, pushing, kicking, screaming. So that was not an normal situation, you had hungry, wild people, who didn't know what is going on, and nit -- did not understood, and you could not talk, because there was no time to talk. You -- if you wanted that people should do something, you s -- the f -- you were giving an order, and if they did not obey to the order, they were be-beaten, and once they were beaten, things -- it was an horrible situation. And then the SS came in, and they were coming with dog. They had to be -- it -- it was an wild horde of hungry, miserable people, yeah, in the beginning. Later on, when they have learned -- it took awhile, that if they are going out, and they do that quick as possible, they can go back quick as possible. That meant they could rest longer, they could sleep longer, there was no beating. But it took awhile, but there was no tal --  <span class="page-break" number="119"></span> </p><p> look, you're Mrs. Lehrman, in one of her speeches that were printed in -- in the newsletter, explained that she was -- something happened during roll call, and the blockelteste took an bucket of cold water and -- and -- over her body, I don't know why. She must have been wild, too, because she must have ec -- behaved just like what I explained to you before, that an blockelteste will use water fe -- every drop of water was so precious, she must have behaved impossible, yeah. But that she doesn't know, and does not even bother to explain. Then she mentions the name of the blockelteste, yeah. That woman lives here, and I know her very well.</p><p>She was not an bitch, she was a normal human being, who was living later on in a displaced person camp, and believe me, she would have been such an horrible woman, she wouldn't have survived one day. So, she doesn't even bother to find out who that blockelteste was, yeah. You know s -- her name, she mentioned her name. So the bucket of water, that was the big -- big event that she used a bucket of water to calm her down. But can you imagine how wild she must have been? And we had man-many, many of those people, who just turned crazy.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did the camp office workers have to go on roll call?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: With -- with just -- in the ba -- the barrack -- barracks four, five and six -- I mean that's barracks four -- barrack four.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Every -- every --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Everybody.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- roll call was in front of the barrack.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. But you were how many people in that barrack?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Nearly hundred.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And all of -- everybody working for the camp office?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="120"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Or individuals who worked in one capacity of secretaries or so, outside of the camp, who went out every day. But they were part of the camp office. On the -- the work place or somewhere, not concentrated where we -- yeah, it was the camp, it was the office -- the office workers of the camp.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So -- so let's -- let's do this just a little bit again.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The roll call really is -- is the information, in order for almost everything to function.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Logistic -- logistics.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So it's -- it's food, it's clothing, it's work, it's movement, everything.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Everything. It was the -- real heart, the be-beating heart of entizil. It was the most important function, the most important function of the whole camp, and it is just too bad that Laura Shelley did not understood what she did with the secretaries of that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: No, it's interesting, because the only thing that you get --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- as far as I can tell, when women talk about the roll call, is how difficult it was.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Not the way it functioned -- at -- and you're right, how would they know, but in spite of the fact of studying it for so long, I myself have not, until now, really understood that without that, you can't do anything in that camp, for good or ill. Either killing people, or saving people, that's the heart of it. That's very interesting. So tell me something. In terms of food rations, di -- amounts of food --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Who made the decision what a ration was for one person?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="121"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Wait a minute. Those decisions were made for -- merely for the whole system in all Germany, so it was made at an very high level. I couldn't tell you where, and who was responsible for it, but just like the civilian population had their food rations, and which applied to each German citizen, and -- or applied to -- to the German population of an certain working group, like light industry, or heavy industry, or whatever, there were certain standards set, yeah. Now, so they were set certain standards for the concentration camp population, and we have information of the caloric intake, and the caloric standards, or supplies for the civilian population, and for the working population in the -- and in the working -- in the camp population. Now, those special rations which every two weeks or so were supplied to heavy -- to indus -- to workers who were working in heavy industry -- prisoners or civilians were sometimes identical, yeah. And there are studies made, there are tables, there are reports on that. I couldn't tell you that by heart, but it is available, and the East Germans did that already after the war, and published that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In many publications, so if that is of interest to you, you can go into the files and -- and look into that, easily.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. But all right, so however, you -- the camp office would say, there are X number of women.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh no.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And -- and -- and -- then so who -- how does that --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: X num -- no, the population in the camp, man or women, had the same supply, food supply, yeah?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="122"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And the order what to supply, on an daily or weekly or monthly basis, was not decided in -- in the camp. Not in the camp, not in the headquarters of the SS. It was -- it was coming from an higher authority, I couldn't tell you where from, yeah, but when every day is a kitchen -- it was a kitchen where you have to collect your bread, in the kitchen you -- the bread rations of an gi- given day, yeah. All week they were five -- for five people, one bread, or four people, or two people, yeah. And accordingly, they had supplied to the barracks, some bread rations.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: If there was margarine, the kitchen had the order to supply for 10 people one cube, or five people, whatever. The kitchen was the one who -- who supplied -- you supplied the kitchen with the amount of people, and you were rec -- you received the amount of rations. But they had the orders from somewhere, yeah, I couldn't tell you where from. We had nothing to do with that, the -- we couldn't care less.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay, but wo -- suppose you said, I don't know, 10,000 people --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- need to be fed today --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- right? But they only gave you -- I mean, would it happen --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- that they would give you rations for only 900?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It wouldn't happen?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. But that happened in the beginning, because they were not quite sure, and they never received the proper amount --  <span class="page-break" number="123"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- of people, because the roll call was not organized, and was contro -- out of control, because the system was not established. But the moment when Katya took over, there was no way that somebody would have gone hungry to bed, yeah. For each person, it -- if -- for each person reported, there was an ration, the daily ration. No matter what. It never happened.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: It did not happen. And if by accident something happened, then the blockelteste was clever enough to su -- to -- to divide the rations so that everybody had something to eat, yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Now, the rations, were they mainly soup, and bread, and some margarine sometimes, and sometimes --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes, and twice a week, an little piece of -- of sausage. There are people today, listen carefully, who swear they have never seen an piece of margarine. They simply don't remember. Who swear they never had -- no -- never even knew that there is something else. They had sometimes an bit of marmalade, sometimes cheese. That was everybody, but they don't remember any more, I don't know why.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So how -- how would -- how would these come to the barrack? The soup was carried in big kettles.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: The people from the barracks --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Would come?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, they have f -- the -- the block stubendienst, yeah, those who were engaged in the block personnel, they had to go in the morning and get the -- the tea, or coffee, or whatever they had, they had to go in between and bring the bread, al-always to the kitchen. The kitchen supplied everything, yeah. In the kitchen, the portions were cut. In the kitchen everything was prepared,</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="124"></span> </p><p> so it was easy to -- to count if one cube of margarine was for 10 people, so 100 people to be supplied, you had 10 -- 10 cubes, yeah? It was not -- no big deal. The soup was always carried -- the kitchen supplied an -- an -- pa -- the personnel from each barrack had to go to the kitchen and collect their -- their portions.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So the kitchen worked very hard?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Very. There were very strong people working in the kitchen, too, but it was mainly reserved for Poles. In the women's kitchen were Polish women only.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you had said that they were members of the Resistance that had come in?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Some of them, some of them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Some of them. But you always said that they were fair.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Who?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The Poles in the kitchen. Different from when the Hungarians came.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yes. The Hungarians were stealing. Oh God, oh God. And not only that, the Hungarians were cruel, stupid -- some of them -- stupid people. There were an couple of -- of Norwegian prisoners in the camp, males. They were so mean to them, they did not understood Europe, yeah, they were coming just like the people out of the ghetto in -- in Romania or where -- where Elie Wiesel comes from, those little shtetls. They never heard of a rest -- the rest of Europe. And right in the camp, there were Norwegians, big, clumsy, yeah, good types of pe -- but couldn't speak anything. Definitely not Yiddish. And they were calling the Norwegians the Eskimos, can you imagine? And were making fun of [inaudible], and were mean. After the war, it's very little known, the Norwegian government took in Jewish refugees, under one condition, no Hungarians.</p><p>No Hungarian Jews. They were not allowed to enter no -- Norway, and nobody knew why, yeah.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="125"></span> </p><p> It was an silent, secret, unwritten regulation and law, yeah. But I can tell you why, yeah. Let -- but I -- I would not mention that -- oh, I would like to have that off record, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You at one time said to me that when you would get the morning liquid, the tea or the coffee -</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- that rather than drinking it, you would clean yours --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: We were washing ourselves, yeah, yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- yes, and that that would be s -- it would have been smart for everybody to do that, rather than drinking it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. We -- not -- not smart, I mean we were hydra -- dehydrated, too. So if you have used an couple of sips, was good enough for your body, but you could clean your genitals, you could clean your face, your hands, whatever. You can, with an piece of a rag, if it's wet, can clean your whole body, yeah. You know that. Even patients in an hospital are washed with a little bit of water, and that is good enough. So, that what we did.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did a lot of women do that, or mainly in the camp office? I'm just wondering.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I don't know --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You don't know.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- if the people in the camp office. I did it in -- in the camp office we had water. In the camp office, we had other conditions.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But I did it in an time when we had no access to anything, in the beginning, especially. I did it, but I don't know what the others did, really not.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now the margarine, you said you also put on your face --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="126"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Exactly.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- so that it wouldn't dry out.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Every day, I have used more margarine on the face then, than I am using cosmetics today, yeah. And I massaged my face every day, every day in the morning, after I washed the face with margarine, and not only that, the rest of my hands, I've smoothed, went over my hairdo, yeah, and it was shining. So I looked pretty well groomed, by using the existing -- the existing -- what shall I tell you? It's existing na -- material, or whatever, yeah. That what I did. I don't know what the others did, yeah. And definitely never discuss what to do. It was an drive, it was an natural drive to look smooth, to look good, because to have cracks around your lips, or s -- on your skin m-meant sometimes death. People were selected for that, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [have massaged my fingers, my hands. I never -- I really had better -- in those days I looked better much more often [indecipherable] today. Today I am using ordinary water and soap. There Ihave used at least cream, and I don't use any lotion. I don't know why, but I massaged my face, around my eyes, just like the book said, with margarine. And during outdoor works, the sun made such an nice -- such a good work, the sun and margarine is giving you such an beautiful tan, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You didn't know that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I'm going to have to stop the tape.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Good.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay? This is the end of tape number five, side A.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>End of Tape Five, Side A  <span class="page-break" number="127"></span> </p><p> Beginning Tape Five, Side B</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay, this is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Helen Tichauer, September eighth, 2000, tape number five, side B, conducted by Joan Ringleheim. That's quite a story.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: What's a story?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The story about how you used the food in order to protect yourself.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: [have an other woman here, an girl who used to be a girl, she lives in Australia now. I received some photos from her, she is over 80, older than I am, looks good, beautiful face, s -- everything looks good. So, at an occasion, while being on the phone with her, I have ask her, "Tell me, when did you had your last face lift?" Yeah? I -- I was very honest, and expected an honest answer. She said, "I beg your pardon? Didn't you told me to use margarine in Auschwitz for my face? I never had a facelift, and I have the best skin you can imagine, and thanks to you."</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So she used margarine? It was a very cheap way of getting a facial.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, but she -- she learned that from me there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you didn't remember telling her?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, you do?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: She noticed what I'm doing, so she did it too.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So maybe we should tell everybody to do this?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Look, what do you -- what do you think about my face?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It's in very good shape.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, you don't have a lot of lines.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: If Ihave lines, they are from the time when I had my -- my skull broken, and my -- and my f- face was split open, and there's the scars, yeah?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But I don't have any lines over my chin.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Forehead.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I don't have any lines like the crocodile of -- you -- have you ever -- ever noticed the face of - - what is the name of the cosmetic company? Helena Rubenstein, the old lady. If you look at her, that face of her, on her -- one of [indecipherable], she looks like an crocodile, and she had all the -- the best possible way of using her cosmetic for herself, right? She had the money, and the massages, and everything. So, if she would have used, instead of whatever she used, mar- margarine, she would never develop -- she would have never developed the crocodile skin. No -- anyhow, I once said --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So did you use margarine after the war, too?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>

But, so if you have s -- then, when people were selected for better jobs, Jewish women, they were dressed into striped clotheses, too.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So is that what you wore?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Why?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because they wanted us to look -- it was summer, and it -- summertime the striped stuff was too heavy, so they even supplied the non-Jewish women with civilian clotheses, but they were all -- b -- they were all lightweight uniformed -- uniformed material dresses, specially sewn for the prisoners, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And who sewed them? In the prison, or -- or in Auschwitz, or</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I don't know where --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You don't know where.</p></p></dialogue>

And exchanged -- clotheses were either exchange after delousing process, not always. Sometimes you received the same stuff back, but sometimes they just took the stuff away and supplied you with different things. Now, what is it you would like to know?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Well, people would say that women would get, if they were short they would get large clothes, if they were tall --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: S-So what?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- s-so that -- what did -- what did they do when they --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Now who cared, who cared?

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, but you could go to your -- to your kapo, or to your -- see, kapos were at the workplace, or to your blockelteste at th -- in the barrack, and demonstrate, and the blockelteste could then go to the -- to the cl-clothing barrack, and a -- and ask for an exchange, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Distinguish for me the difference between the beglidinskammer --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I beg your pardon?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Distinguish Canada --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- commando from beglidinkskammer -- the clothing.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh, well the Canada commando was the commando who sorted all incoming belongings from the people -- from the new arrivals. They were not only clothing, there were --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Everything.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- everything. And that was on the sortings facility for everything, yeah. And they had nothing whatsoever to do with those people who worked in the clothing barrack, because there were clothes -- clothing and shoes, and linen -- not linen, clothing, shoes, some underwear, some head covers for the prisoners only, yeah. There were hundred and thousand, and thousands, and thousands of prisoners. So, don't think that there was nothing to do.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: No, no, no, I -- I'm -- I'm not saying that, but --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Canada had --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- is it nothing to do --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- nothing whatsoever.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, what is coming in to the beglidinskammer is the -- is the --  <span class="page-break" number="133"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: The leftovers --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- is the issue --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- the leftovers from the Canada, which could not be sent to th -- to the Reich, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Those things which were -- those dresses which were of low quality, were supplied to the beglidinskammer for distribution.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But the beglidinskammer also got sort of German issue. They got uniforms that were coming in from the outside. So they had two kinds of material coming in. Lefto --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Two kinds of supplies.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Plies.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But -- yeah. And it was quite an big enterprise, yeah. There were 600 people working in that business.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In the beglidinskammer? So it was a big storehouse?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was the incoming stuff, and outgoing stuff had to be counted, had to be prepared, had to be bundled, yeah. Was constant movement. And don't forget the beglidinskammer had to supply the branch camps, wherever a woman was, just the same, yeah. They sometimes changed very often their clothes, more often than -- than the outdoor workers. So they have supplied them with new clothing, or clean clothing, and received the dirty one, yeah. It was an clearinghouse for constant change, especially the odds -- the branch camps were very well looked after, yeah, they are always well dressed, clean. That was an very important function, the function of the -- of the clothing from barrack, yeah. Very important. In the beginning they were full of lies, but later on,  <span class="page-break" number="134"></span> </p><p> it was whenever you have -- whenever you could see somebody from those branch camps, they looked just like out of the box, beautifully dressed. Everything was beautiful, clean.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But that wasn't true of people who were in Auschwitz itself, 0 --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, no.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right. So they would clean the clothes for the -- the branch [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Every -- a-all the clothes, it's not --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But not --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- not only for -- they would clean for the indoors too, but not -- not under -- under such care, and -- and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: It depend --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Huh?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: It -- the -- in -- inside workers of the camp -- of the main camp, were well dressed, too, yeah, clean. They could -- the blockelteste had som-sometimes an problem to take the whole barrack, and to exchange the -- to stand there in front of the beglidinskammer, in front of the clothing barrack, and exchange dresses, yeah. So they received clean ones, and they left the dirty ones.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: In the -- in the wintertime, when it got very cold --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- who wa -- who was able to get coats or jackets, or sweaters? It certainly --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You could -- you could -- the blockelteste could ask for sweaters, and receive for each member of the barrack an sweater under the clothes, to wear, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> <span class="page-break" number="135"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So it would depend upon the -- I don't know, the --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes, it was an regulation.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That said it was okay?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That the people are [indecipherable] to receive that, or that, or that, yeah? Or they were forbidden to have that, that, and that, yeah? For example, a woman was not allowed to wear the brassiere. While we in the camp office, we had brassieres. Nobody -- nobody bothered, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And what about underwear? Panties?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Those who had striped clotheses, there was -- there were under -- underpants, not very -- very sexy ones, but there were underpants, and some kind of an undershirt, and the others, the Jewish prisoners, who wore dresses, or whatever, they -- they were allowed to -- to wear an -- sweaters, under the dress.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Under the dress? Not over the dress?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, because sun -- they had to be recognized as prisoners, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You could wear under -- under the dress, anything you wanted. Underwear, you organized.</p><p>They were stealing. They were -- I sometimes ask some girls from the clothing barrack to get me some panties, a dozen or so. So I took the whole dozen on my body, went to an barrack, undressed myself, supplied that among the people, and returned without.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What about gloves? Did anybody -- was anybody able to get gloves?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. But sometimes they were s -- shri -- they were shrinking those gloves, sometimes an real glove looked like was that -- like my fist, small, because they went through -- through the steam cleaning machine, and was shrinking. But in some of the outdoor work -- workplaces, they were allowed to wear gloves, and received gloves.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="136"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Socks?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Gloves.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, how about socks?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. Pardon, socks?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Socks.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Nobody cared, yeah, if you wore socks, or if you had rags. Soldiers wear rags too, so it was not officially supplied, yeah, but somehow they couldn't care less. Everybody looked after them -- after herself and people somehow had what -- what they -- some of them had no chance to protect themselves in wintertime, they fr-frozen toes. Some of the girls had frozen nipples. It's a pity that you don't speak German. I have here some good literature of -- of -- of interviews. I have here some interviews of people who are describing their pro-problems at wintertime, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, maybe you can tell me the reference, and I can have it translated. So -- before I leave.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. I may give you an copy of an -- of one paper where -- no, [indecipherable] it's a -- references, no, it's enough if I tell you that the girls had frozen nipples.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So what did they do about it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They were coming to me, and -- and as I have learned from one of the doctors, that cod liver oil is very good for frozen -- frozen parts of the body, and -- and frozen nipples. I collected cod liver oil every day from the garbage heap of the -- of the [indecipherable]. There was no garbage heap, but the package room, where the non-Jewish prisoners re -- would receive packages from home, were opened before they were supplied to the -- to the owner, and they have taken out all the vitamins. Every package at least contained an bottle of cod liver oil from home, because it was so good, and important. But the SS removed from each package, the cod liver oil, and the vitamins, and throwing that out in front of the barrack, and in the morning -- early morning, the</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="137"></span> </p><p> cleaners, they are coming, collecting that, and into the garbage. Now when I have learned that, as the package room was next to our barrack, the package barrack was number five, I was living on number four, I went out every morning, and collected all the cod liver oil, not the vitamins, but I took all the cod liver oils into my camp office. I re -- consumed every day, one bottle of cod liver oil. I was stinking. From miles away you could feel that somebody who was -- who was smelling after cod liver oil, but I think it saved my life. It saved a lot, because if -- to have in your body, every day, an bottle of cod liver oil, meant something, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What does it do?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Huh?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: What does --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Drinking, drinking.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No, no, no, what does it do to -- for you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Cod liver oil?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I know I took it as a kid, but --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Good, then go into the library and read.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And find out.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Read what it does. But, besides that, I drank -- I was drinking daily one bottle of cod liver oil for months, maybe a whole year. Then, I supplied the hospital, my doctor friends, with cod liver oil, so that when patients were coming they could treat them, and friends of mine who had frozen nipples and toes, I supplied them with cod liver oil so that they can treat themselves.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And rubbing --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- cod liver oil helps. Really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="138"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. If so -- if it was not overdue, because sometimes the toes were falling off, yeah. But everybody noticed an frozen nipple, so most of the girls were coming, and I supplied them with cod liver oil, okay? That's an story, too.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, absolutely.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Huh?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Absolutely. Tell me about shoes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. Huh?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Who got wooden shoes, and who got normal shoes? O-Other kinds of shoes, I shouldn't say normal shoes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: All the workers got wooden shoes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Outside workers?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Got wooden shoes?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. And inside workers got good shoes, not -- you see, the cont -- the whole system was not designed for the well being of the inmates, yeah?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And sometimes you had big shoes, and sometimes you had small shoes, so it was a mite -- nightmare, the shoe business. I, for example, could not get boots. And people were allowed to wear boots at wintertime, and I couldn't get boots, do you know why? Because most women were taller than I, and the size of the boot was too high. It was hitting my knees. So I never -- I never, never, during all those years, I've been able to get a pair of boots to fit my legs.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And what happened to those sh-shoes, those hiking shoes that you came in with?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="139"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, th-then when the summer was coming, yeah, it was too hot, and then I had a better job already, I couldn't walk around with those shoes, you know, in the camp office.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Not even in the winter?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The first.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The first one?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The first winter, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And after that, what did you wear?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Shoes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Just regular shoes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I could any -- any pair of shoes in the -- shoe in the clothing barrack. I just se --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But if you went outside during the winter, when there was a lot of snow, it was --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well then, I had my -- my boot.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Then you had your other ones?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see. So you kept them the whole time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: As long as I could.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right. So that was lucky, because --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Very.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- you couldn't get other --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Very, very.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- boots, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And for my size, yeah. I never had an -- what are you calling in English? You get s-some hardening -- the hardening --  <span class="page-break" number="140"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Corns?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Corns, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I never had a corn in my whole life.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really? How interesting.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Never had a corn. Because I have always taken care of my shoes, which I wore, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But shoes were really crucial in Auschwitz, weren't they? So it could kill you, or not.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They are as crucial in New York as in Auschwitz, believe me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: What do you think, why have they developed after so many years, that kind of walking shoes people wear, even with fur coats, yeah? By the way, I had -- I developed one bunion, several years ago. Now, that has nothing to do with Auschwitz, what I'm telling you. And a bunion is no fun, and most people must undergo surgery because it hurts. I have decided not to undergo surgery, and I have decided no matter how expensive, and how pretty the shoe is, I have cut out an hole on each pair of shoes, where the bunion grew. And if you are looking today my -- at my li -- leg, I have no bunion any more.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It just went away?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: It just went away, because normally, if you have the pressure --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: It keeps it going.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And I -- people were laughing at me. Here, in New York. I was well dressed, beautiful shoes, and the cut up -- and the hole, and I couldn't care less, yeah. And it was a good decision. I'll show you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Let's see. No bunions.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="141"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Huh?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No bunions, no corns.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Okay, you have learned something now.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It's worthwhile to ruin your shoes, than to ruin your leg.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Absolutely. I agree with you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And just an ordinary little hole, and if it's too little, then you can make it bigger.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So, it was always close to the barrack, where they were protected from the weather, and from the sun, or so. But, usually it took place outdoors, because th -- if it was too heavy, an heavy rain, the SS didn't wanted to get wet, either. So it was never done for the inmates -- I mean, they would never allow that for the benefit of the inmates, but for their own benefit. And we have used that, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>

In Birkenau the la - - la -- the wooden barracks -- yeah, the wooden barracks had buckets. The brick barracks had buckets, too. The latrines were actually real buildings, wooden buildings, or brick buildings,</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="145"></span> </p><p> behind the whole row in the -- in the women's camp. Beho -- behind the row of brick barracks, there were barracks who -- in -- were in use for -- for the latrine. We have -- they are still in good shape today, they still exist. You can see for those if you go to Birkenau, you can see how the latrines looked. There were holes --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right, right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- where you were sitting, and doing your business. It was an ugly business.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Why?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Very ugly.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Want to explain that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Uh?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You want to explain? Why was it ugly?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, to sit there, and to be pushed around sometimes, be -- there were more people than holes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Is that where you went, or did you have a -- was there a latrine that --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I went on the barrack -- on the bucket, but in the beginning I was living there, too.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you have diarrhea?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And [had diarrhea. And I don't even want to think about it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It's awful.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Horrible. Bloody diarrhea, no medication, dirty, couldn't clean yourself. Wait -- wait until the next morning, you had an bit of tea, and then you had to use that to clean yourself, and to wash your tookas. It's horrible, horrible.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So to -- h-how does -- I know when, in ordinary circumstances, normal circumstances --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> <span class="page-break" number="146"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- when you get diarrhea, it's very difficult. You have to make sure that you don't get dehydrated, it's exhausting.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Who -- who could think about dehydration? We had nothing to drink.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Because the water we've -- they've supplied us, that caused the diarrhea, was infected water.</p><p>So th-that, you cannot imagine, it was -- was like an vicious circle. If -- I really don't know how everything work -- how I -- how I overcame all those things. Hard to believe. You see, diarrhea is something unpleasant, even here, when you have all the facilities, let alone where you had no facilities whatsoever to clean yourself, or to -- to -- to use an toilet whenever you had the urge, yeah. And there was not diarrhea only, as you had some -- always two or three different conditions. I don't know how we did it, I really don't know. I tell you what I did, during the heavy time, and hard time, somehow I got myself a tin -- a tin, and whenever I had the urge to do something during the night, I used the tin. Then -- put that in front of my legs, in that bed where we were laying, but some of the women used their -- their eating --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Bowls?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Bowls for both, and that was an big tragedy, because they never -- they couldn't survive. You see, you -- you infected yourself, and re-infected yourself. You couldn't -- and no matter what we did to explain not to do that, it didn't help. So, I can tell you what I did, but I can not ec -- explain why the others used only th-the same bowl for their business they used for eating. I never did it. I got -- got myself a can of -- it was approximately as -- ama -- an two pound can, tall like that. Was just good to use as a -- for urinating. Also, I never had to go down when -- I like to live always on the top, where most people didn't wanted to climb, cause they had no -- no energy. I could always climb, I was always on the top, and there used my -- my -- and then all I had to go</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="147"></span> </p><p> was going down in the morning, and s -- and empty that into the bucket. And then I left the can again on my bed, and -- and the block personnel, who checked those beds, and sometimes even arranged the beds, they never -- never throw those cans out. They knew what it is used for. So that is the way how I really survived.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So -- and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: How I managed, yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. And other women did similar things, as far as you know?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Some of them, probably, yes. Nobody -- there was no consitent --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- to tell you what to do, yeah?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right, right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You acted on your own instinct, and own judgement. There you were really alone. What are you doing?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I was just checking.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Tell me about the bedding, the mattr --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: About what?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The mattress, the -- what people s -- what people slept on.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did most people have some hay, or whatever it was, what was it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no, no, we had mattresses with straw.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mattresses with straw.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yes.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="148"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So they were covered? The -- the straw was covered by some material?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah, yeah, in -- yeah. It -- mattresses -- I mean, it was not a mattress like --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- you go out and buy a mattress, but it was an -- kind of an pillow k -- a large pillow cover, yeah, with an hole in the center, where you stuffed in straw. So it was covered, and protected, yeah, and then we were sleeping on that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And how was -- how was that -- did all the bunks have that already, or did people have to bring it when they --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no, no, the bunks had the wooden -- wooden bottom, and the blockelteste, and the block personnel, had to get those from an special unit, who supplied mattresses, and the straw, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>They -- that had to be carried from an special unit, into the block.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Uh-huh. And how long did they -- one mattress --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Forever.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You just -- that was it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: All the time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It was all the time, they didn't change those?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So after awhile, because of --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: They were thrown out, and I -- they were ye -- probably full of urine, or who knows what.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: After awhile, but it took awhile.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Pretty un --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But -- huh?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> <span class="page-break" number="149"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Go ahead.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Again, you had to s -- you had to ask for it, and then you had -- you were supplied with -- you have -- or they arranged the supply of any request from time to time, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And in the beginning, did you sleep alone on the -- on the bunk, or did you have two, or three, or four people?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: 15.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But normally people slept so that we could accommodate ourselves.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And were there a lot of relationships that were closer than --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: There were?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: As -- it was actually introduced by -- in the beginning, not amongst the Jewish girls, but in the beginning, where we had so many German from Ravensbriick, the first thousand, you had many who were there for years, in Ravensbriick, and they have developed some relationship among themselves, and those who had no partners, were looking -- seeking for partners amongst the Jewish women. And Jewish women were introduced to lesbianism, as German women from Ravensbriick. They didn't know one thing, they didn't know the difference, they didn't know anything, yeah. So, it was very hard to distinguish who is really a partner or not. But people were looking for love, and warmth, and companionship. They're lonely.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was that helpful to people, you think?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't know. I have never experienced anything, because I had friends from home, from the youth movement and so on, so we were used to live together in the summer camps, and so on. So there was no lack of -- lack of -- we were not lonely, yeah. Girls from school, neighbors, we  <span class="page-break" number="151"></span> </p><p> always were seeking for some old relationship from home. We were young then, and sports -- from the sports club, or so on. So it -- it -- ifis me, I had no -- I personally had no problems, I always had company, and that was good enough.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Wh-When you think about the majority of women that you knew, not just -- not just your close friends, but people that you saw.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did they tend to have a relationship with one person, or two people -- no -- including people who became lovers, but was that more typical?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [indecipherable] it -- look, the -- the problem among the people was -- was a language, yeah?</p><p>It's not enough just to be attracted by a body, right? In those days, we needed communication.</p><p>You had to learn how to survive, you had to learn many things, and that couldn't be done without an verbal communication. So, people who knew the language, the German women, spoke German. Our women, from Slovakia in the beginning, spoke enough German to communicate.</p><p>They were -- but we were mainly looking for the companionship of political prisoners, because those who were professional prostitutes, were not very attractive to us, they were different, was an different -- different category of people. And the political prisoners had their own companionship with -- since Ravensbriick, who -- there were couples who were already established couples. And those who had no partner were not even seeking for any partner, because they had their husbands at home, or in -- during the war, somewhere on the front, or they were old, and were never married, and had no -- didn't know what it means to have a partner at all, yeah, spinsters, who were -- but they were decent people who were idealists, because that was the reason why they were put into the camp as Socialists or Communists. So, I myself always looked for good people. I had an good friend who was the wife of an -- she was German,</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="152"></span> </p><p> but had an Jewish husband, and two sons at home. And she practiced, more or less, medicine.</p><p>We had such different ailments, like in civilian life, all of a sudden, everybody -- most of the women -- at least I, among others, we were lot an -- pus in my whole mouth, yeah. Between the teeth, the tongue, everything. I couldn't talk, I couldn't swallow, I couldn't do nothing. It was an awful situation. I don't know where from, how she got it, she was coming every day with something. And I had to keep that in my mouth for awhile, and then spit it out, and she cured me, yeah. Because she knew from experience, what to do under the camp conditions. Having her husband to probably practice medicine there an different way, but I had an woman what -- during my malaria attacks, who was an Jehovah Witness, who brought -- and worked in the SS pharmacy. They were stealing every day, one tablet of shineen, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What is shineen?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Shineena. That is the medication if you have malaria. Shining, hining, shining, how do you pronounce it? C-h-i-n-i-n-e. Good?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So, [had a pool of helpers help us, yeah? Of good people, and I would not s -- would not deal with -- with the rough or low -- low grade -- low grade morally, low grade people. I -- I was selective, and that was my luck, yeah. Could speak the language, and it was my luck that I was selective. And so -- but nobody approached me, ever.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I was an ugly -- must have been very ugly with my short hair.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Sippy, I remember --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- when -- when Irwin was alive --  <span class="page-break" number="153"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- and talked to me about this when we -- when we all would talk about it. And he said that -- and it wa -- I'm not now talking about lesbian relationships, but --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Mm-hm.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- he said that men did not pair bond, and women tended to pair bond. Insofar as you know, is that the case, that women tended, whether they were lovers or not --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- to be with one other person, very close?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You always had an camp sister.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah? You always had a camp sist --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Ifnothing, always. Why? It was practical, more practical to have two rations together to share, than to have only one ration, yeah. You could manipulate, if you had two pieces of bread, two rations, and two pieces or margarine, yeah, you could go and use together only one ration of margarine together. Limit yourself. And one ration of bread, but exchange the other half for something which was more important than the ration, yeah? And I was never in the exchange business, but n -- I had a partner, a very religious girl, whom I found there in the camp office. I have known her brother at home, and because of that she was more attracted -- I was more attracted to her, and she trusted me. With her I was even sleeping together in one bed. She became my partner, but very religious. And she's still alive, she lives in Jerusa -- in the -- Jerusalem. She was a business women. She went out and exchanged sometimes, she returned with some garlic, or with an onion, yeah, what the girls were smuggling in from the field where - - where they had to perform. Now, I knew that that is important, more important than a piece of bread, so if we were eating garlic, and onions with margarine on bread. Even if only half of it  <span class="page-break" number="154"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> wat -- the vitamins were more important than the starch, yeah? So that was an relationship where she was a businesswoman, she supplied me with all the goodies, and -- but she became my -- my ca -- then later on, I became to shabbas goy, it was Pesach, and she wouldn't eat bread, so we had to exchange the bread against potatoes. And we had to cook the potatoes illegally. I had already my drawing office, I had an stove, yeah. So I cooked inside of the stove, because outside we were not allowed to sh -- to cook. And that was an relationship of eating together, and do- doing business together, and most girls v -- eat -- nobody was eating alone, that -- I can tell you that. Th-That was an -- an habit, to have an partner with to eat, yeah, together. So, I don't know if the men did it. Irwin must have known better. I never spoke with him about it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: He said no.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Huh?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: He said no.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He said no. But maybe in his experience.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Youw're right. It-It's hard -- it's hard to -- to generalize with so many thousands of people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah, but that was -- had nothing to do with love, or with lesbianism, or --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was just a necessity of going to an restaurant, you'd rather sit with somebody and eat together, than to be alone in an corner. Right, or not?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, sure.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Same, I mean we were human, the same feelings, the same instinct.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But it -- it -- it --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Among women, it was more important, no?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Perhaps, than for the men.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="155"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. I can -- have never experien -- sometimes you had only one -- one -- what's his name?</p><p>Bowl. So you were forced to eat two people out of one bowl, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: One bowl.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: If they like it or not.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right, right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And we're entitled to two bowls of soup, so once they" ve finished the first, they could collect the second, but they were forced to eat together, or they had only one spoon, or -- look, they were [indecipherable] funny circumstances, which drove you into -- into together in, yeah. It was not the -- the men probably had their own bowl, and could eat their own soup by themselves, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And why would that be the case? Was the s -- was the circumstances in the men's camp different --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- and better than the women's? Physical circumstances.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It depend -- Irwin was never in Birkenau.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah. So, c-call mine was different, and in Auschwitz, he was better off than anybody in Birkenau, and still he described in his book his -- the camaraderie between an couple of men, among themselves, how they manage. That is an good book he wrote, yeah. But noth -- n-no mystery, and no I -- I -- I, yeah? It's very well done. I will give you one book to carry with you, because whenever you will have a chance to have somebody who speaks German, it will be helpful to translate you an little bit --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="156"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- step by step, bit by bit, yeah. Do you think I'm right?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Good. Now, what else please?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I'm just trying to think if there's --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: It -- does that answer what you -- your question about the camaraderie? The shortage of bowls -- bowls, or bowels?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Bowls.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Bowls?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes, bowels are different.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Okay, b-o -- b-o-w-l, yeah?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And bowel is?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: B-o-w-e-l.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: E-1? Uh huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right, right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Bowel movement.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right, so it's different, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Good, now I know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But Sippy, let me ask you something. If you have among the women, ha -- mainly pairs --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- sometimes it may be three or four --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- but mainly it was two people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="157"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What did that mean between those two people, and another two people? Was there -- di -- were there circumstances where there were a lot of difficulties in a barrack between groups of people, either groups of different nationalities, or -- no. But everybody wasn't nice to each other?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Everybody wasn't what?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Nice. It was a difficult circumstance, so people have complicated ways of --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Look, the people amongst themselves in the barrack, if th-they were living in an barrack, and worked in the same work detail, yeah, are so tired at the evening, and were so busy to look after their own business. That means eating, and sleeping, yeah. There was no time for being nice or not nice. You will have today among people in good conditions living, neighbors are fighting neighbors, yeah. It's human. Some people, they're fighting with their mouths, yeah. Fist fights, nobody wanted to lose any energy. So it's harmless if you scream at each other. I don't even consider that as not nice, just human to let it out. And I really don't know -- or don't think that to make an big issue out of it. People were very tense, or weak, or tired, or sleepy, or hungry. So sometimes they screamed at each other, and screaming is harmless. I don't think that screaming is a crime. Not even if the blockelteste were scre -- the blockeltestes were screaming. To -- to judge blockelteste and other screaming personnel, f -- only for one reason that they were screaming, is not justified.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Sippy, you not only didn't have watches, you didn't have calendars, right?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Uh-huh, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So how -- if people were religious, whether they were Christian, or they were Jewish, how did they find out, and how did they respond to the various holidays, as far as you remember?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: First of all, newcomers brought in the news of the day --</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="158"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- and events.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Some had contact through the camp office. One person only, she wer -- was able to discover the date, or the -- yeah, that spreads very quickly. There was the latrines, where people have communicated, even if they have known each other. That was no problem.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: That was no problem. [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So the people tried to celebrate holidays?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No. No holidays, didn't matter?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My religious girl, she -- she knew everything.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: She had the calendar, we had in the camp office a day, and everything. There were newcomers who brought exactly the -- all news in, and cross -- cross we -- we could cross check, or they could cross check the Jewish holidays. But it had no -- no significance for me personally, because to be in a place like that, it -- it could have become schizophrenic, to be in the hell, and to -- and to sing like in heaven, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And -- and you -- this religious -- this woman who was your -- your partner --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- who was religious, what did she do about being kosher?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="159"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Kosher? She was not eating anyth -- any sausage --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Really?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- when we had -- when we had the rations. I gaved her my cheese, and she gave me her sausage. So | ate her sausage too, and she was eating my cheese.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And that how we managed. Pesach she was not eating any bread, but she was living on potatoes, and that was it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I'm stopping the tape.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>End of Tape Six, Side A Beginning Tape Six, Side B</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tape number six, side B, United States Holocaust Memorial interview with Helen Tichauer, September eighth. Sippy, what did runners do?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Who?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Runners. Like Mala.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, runner.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: There were different types of runners. There were even runners, I can show you very nice pictures of Indian tribes in the old times, and Indian tribes today, South American Indian tribes, where people live in the high plateau of the Andean mountains, where they have no other communication, like verbal communication between one tribe and another, by using individuals, the so-called runners, yeah? They walk from one village to another and communicate, or convey messages, and so on. So the runner business is not an invented one of the concentration camp, but as we had no vehicles, the ter -- the distances between camp -- in the camp, between</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="160"></span> </p><p> barracks, were pretty large. Bicycles were not used for -- for -- inmates couldn't u -- did not have any bicycles, only the SS, some of them were able to use bicycles. The SS runners actually had bicycles. An runner is somebody who conveys messages, or who has an job to do, to do it fr -- [indecipherable] from one point to another, and ha -- with a certain order to do something, to bring some people from one barrack to -- to another, to -- to the front entrance for any reason, or to -- is a messenger service, more or less. Now, there were no -- no other way of communication, no-not even telephones, yeah. They have used people who were messengers, yeah. So, sometimes they had dual -- an dual duty. Sometimes they were runners who were sent from one - - from the main e -- from the camp office, for example, to an barrack, and convey an message or ask the blockelteste to come to the camp office, or some similar orders were given from headquarters, from the t-top management to us, and we had to execute that through the runners, yeah. Through those people who are sending them through different barracks, or different facilities to -- to convey an certain order, or message, or whatever. And they work mainly in couples. When the one couldn't do it, then the other took over, yeah, or when one was on lunch break, or in the toilet, and something has to be done in a hurry, the other took over. They were couples molis. But then you had an other function of certain runners, who made an -- had an du- dual function. They were multi-lingual, and could be used as translators. So, such, for example, was Mala, was an runner, and an translator between German and French, and German and I think Polish, she could speak Polish.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's Mala Zeemadbel.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Zeema, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="161"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Then you had another runner, which was -- and an translator, which was not one to be identified, but I know where -- her name, and I know where she lives. Her maiden name then was Ava Pomeranz. She was an -- an -- one of those runners who took, like Mala, and many others, who were taking sometimes people from the camp office, who were asked to report to our camp office, and were then taken for -- with those runners, and an SS man, over to the Gestapo for interrogation, yeah. That was one of the activities, too, to accompany certain people who have to appear at the SS headquarters in the shtopskaboida for interrogation. That was ma -- one of the main activities of the shtopskaboida of personnel, SS with their secretaries. Now, there was Mala, there was Ava Pomeranz, and so on. So, there are some still alive, and I know where they are, and I even made myself a list of all the runners. So, it was an important activity, because without telephone, and without vehicles, and with such an big enterprise was -- there was so many movements going -- so many things going on, that they had that -- that it was a messenger service among others, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So -- so at any one time, about how many runners would there be?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You think?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Wait a minute, [indecipherable] and two, four, six -- I would say a dozen.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Mm-hm, and where were they living? Were there -- was there a particular --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: As a -- in the individual barracks, or th-they were not living in private rooms, just located close to -- in -- they were living in -- in barracks, just like anybody else.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did they have -- did they have a particular insignia on their arm or something --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah, sure.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- to -- so that --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="162"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, sure.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- she was -- they were clear that th --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: You must realize that the la -- if it comes to insignias on the arms, there were the ar -- the arm bins, yeah?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Arm bands?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Bands, yeah. The la -- you had n-n-nearly every function was marked, yeah, in the camp. The blockelteste, the block administrator, the lagerelteste, the rapport schreiber, the -- every runner.</p><p>Many, many people were marked so that you could recognize who they are. And at the workplace, the same thing. You had the kapos, the sub-kapos, the foremen, and many other functions in the wor -- at the workplace, were still -- were marked just the same. So that wasn't my job to do just the same, I did all those -- those arm --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Arm -- arm bands?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Correct, so I -- as you can see, I had an important job, yeah?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So what sort of an insignia did the runner have? What did it say?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Runner, it was --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: It said runner. And what is that in German?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [indecipherable] loifa.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Loifa.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And did they -- were they considered privileged in some way? Were they not in --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They were privileged, yeah of course, they had an job where they could enter any building, where they could run, or be outdoors any time of the day, even if there was curfew during an selection. That -- that was it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> <span class="page-break" number="163"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So do you think that some of these people actually ended up being in touch with the resistance because they could then bring messages, or was that --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: They ended up like what?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Were some of these women --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- I don't know about the men, I'm assuming the men had runners, too.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, good, of course.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Do you think they were -- some of them were in contact with the resistance, because then they could --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: With whom?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Resistance.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh. I cannot answer that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But it would be an opportunity, right, because you could bring messages? They could bring more than just the --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Because you have an idea, do you think the SS wouldn't have had the same idea?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Of course they'd have the same idea. That doesn't mean it wouldn't happen.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So, you had -- you had -- you were very careful, because you see, if you -- everybody was careful with those people, you never know for whom they are running, yeah?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh, right. No matter which side, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: People in the resistance were not visible.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. Of course.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="164"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: If todays -- ev -- anybody who's telling you the story, resistance [indecipherable], they were invisible people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But somebody was in it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But they were not visible.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right, right. And do you not trust the people who've talked afterwards about being in the resistance?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Everybody's telling you now he was in the resistance, now what kind of business is that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell me about Mala Zeemadbel, what kind of a person she was.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Selfish, stupid girl.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Selfish, stupid girl.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Show-off, big mouth. She had her own contact reels, yeah, the Belgian Jewesses, and she could help, because she could come into our office, and ask for favors any time, and she was [indecipherable] yeah. Any time, she -- she had to go through us. And if she needed something, she could come and ask for a favor. But what we are talk -- making out of her, it's nonsense. If she wouldn't have been stupid, she wouldn't have planned -- or she actually didn't planned her escape. If she wouldn't have been stupid, she wouldn't have done what she did. She had all the chances to survive. What was the hurry?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So why did she do it? Because she's stupid?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Look, when she arrived, I was then still working -- you know I worked in the -- among others as the printer of those numbers --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- fo -- f-for newcomers, yeah?

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was late afternoon, must have been winter off -- late afternoon, but it was dark. So there were -- I -- I don't know how many hundreds newcomers and to register them, and to process so many, and until they are passing through everything, and finally got their numbered labels, and -- sewn on, they were standing in one corner, and waiting until the whole group was processed, and after that, the blockelteste, for whom they were designated to be transferred, was coming, and took them to their barracks -- to the barracks. And that what happened with that particular transport when she arrived, where she was in the Belgian transport. I was sitting there, and watching, and all of a sudden, somebody went up on a table like that, and giving orders to the crabat -- to the whole group. She didn't know, is she crazy? I went over to her, and I said, "What are you doing here? Get down from the table." She didn't understood. I said, "Get down. Look, you are now in Auschwitz. You are not in Belgium, I don't want you to show off. The moment you show off, you've -- the SS will remember you. Get down off here -- from here. Get off the table." So, a-after awhile she went down. And then the next days -- she took over leadership, yeah? Next days, she was presented by the blockelteste as somebody who speaks languages. In the arbatz einsatz, yeah. Was in our building, in our office, in our [indecipherable] my drawing office, so she was sent -- given the job as an runner. And from the runner, she became translator, both. And from there on, she had every day to come in the morning to the camp office, and take orders, and what to do, and what [indecipherable] she got her work order every day, in the morning. And that's the way how I have been with her on an daily basis, and I met her every day, and it was a normal relationship between me and the others. But that's the way -- that's the time when we met for the first time, and when I jumped at her to get off, yeah. Because wa -- the</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="166"></span> </p><p> moment the SS noticed somebody with such qualities, they picked you and made -- gave to you an big job as an -- as an camp vi -- I don't know what, and it was not very nice to witness somebody to be recruited f-for an cruel job, yeah? So in any case, that went on, on and on. She did her job, and she was coming every day, and when she needed some favors to help the girls from Belgium, she had an easy -- easy approach to us, because we helped her. Now -- then, all of a sudden, the day when she escaped, you know that she had malaria, and she used to have attacks from time to time, and we knew that. The day when she escaped, same day I we -- she was living on number six barrack, in the barrack where the people from the -- the klidonskcamera, they are living. And I went at lunchtime, over to six. There was Ava, my friend who lives now in Israel, whose husband I made for -- the sign, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What's her last name? Ava?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Valansuela is her name now.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh, alright.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And I went over with her because I think some of the Poles -- Polish men were coming, and wanted to meet with the girls in my office, I always vacated my office, I d -- I went walking. I went over to Ava, to number six. Four, five, six, and Ava had a boyfriend, he was visiting her, an Dutch boy, so I didn't wanted to interfere. Then I finally noticed the barrack was totally empty, but -- because they were working in the beglidinskammer the whole barrack, but there was Mala in her bed, and next to her, her boyfriend Edek, standing next to her. So I thought she had again her malaria attack, yeah. I went over, and went to ask her how she is, here was Edek standing, she seemed to me quite normal, so she had no -- no malaria attack, so I didn't wanted to interfere. He visited her, okay. Why she was in bed, I wi -- don't know. In any case, I left. An hour later, the siren went on. That was the last moment before she escaped, I may have been the</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="167"></span> </p><p> last person who ever spoke to her, yeah. Now, s -- they were caught, there are several stories, but it is true that she had a malaria attack during her ordeal, and while escaping, and he panicked, and went to the village doctor. And that was it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And the doctor told on them?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Hm?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The doctor contacted the Germans?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So the rest is history.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But what's the --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Huh?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- from -- from your perspective, the different stories about what happened afterwards.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: What stories do you know?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: There -- there stories that she -- when she was going to be hung, she had a razor blade, and she had cut herself.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That is true. She had the razor blade from Herta -- Herta Rote, who was another lifer, who's dead by now, and she cut herself.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And this was before they took her to be hung?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: When she was --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: She wasn't hung.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: She wasn't hung?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no. They wanted to hang her, she cut herself. According -- you see, I always avoided anything like being present. Everybody had to come and to witness that, the whole camp. And I locked myself up in my drawing office, nobody could see me, that I am there, and I never went</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="168"></span> </p><p> to the execution, yeah. And so I cannot tell you what really happened, but according to the others, she cut herself, she was supplied by Herta Rote with an razor blade, and Mandel -- see, according to the people, she was hitting Mandel with her bloody hand in her face. Then she was ordered -- then -- then the Hauptchafuehrer Maul, ordered her to carry her into the crematorium, where she was shot by him, and that was it. Then the father of the -- Edek was brought in from an village, was hanged in front of his son, and then he was hanged. So that was an badly planned escape. That was selfishness. She put so many people into -- into trouble, and lost her life. And she could have survived easily, like all us, and could have led a normal life. She had an boyfriend at home that she abandoned for Edek. I don't think she was very clever.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: What year was that? When did she --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Huh?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What year was that when she escaped?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: 744.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: 44, and she arrived there in "43?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Ah, wait a minute, what are you talking about?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When did Mala arrive in Auschwitz, do you remember?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Arrive?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Ah, "40 -- "43. End -- no, end of 42.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: End of "42.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: End of "42.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And this was the summer of "44 when she escaped?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="169"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Escaped, yeah. But I would not like to bring Mala in at all, because everybody writes about Mala, Mala, so let's everybody -- I -- I have -- I knew her on the first day she arrived.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I spoke to her the last hour before she left, yeah? That is all I rem -- will -- want to remember.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. Tell me about Rosa Robbat. What was she like?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: A normal girl. Very clever, very shrewd, and s -- again, as they had no Polish Jewish girls in the camp office whatsoever, they had a hard time to help each other to get -- Polish Jewish girls had no good positions because of that. So, there were some work details which were better. For example, the work details, indoor work details, yeah. Pretty good, and [indecipherable] the Polish girls could be accommodated. Rosa helped -- tried to help them through me, yeah. She made contact with me, and whenever she needed something, she approached me, and I helped her. But sh -- I was never recruited by her for anything else, yeah. We had an entire different relationship. She knows -- she had what she wanted from me, I had what I wanted from her. I -- She organized for me all my underpanties, and all the ma -- bowls of -- rolls of material to make, quickly, handkerchiefs for your head, to cover when newcomers arrived, especially from my city, in the lase -- late autumn, "44. She brought me a lot of material when I could go to the barrack, and supply the people, they never received -- it was cold, [indecipherable]. They never received any covers, so there where she helped me, and she helped me to steal from the clothing barrack, whatever -- whatever I needed, and I helped her by placing people, whenever she asked me. Then, that's about it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But what about the aprons, didn't she --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, shall I tell you the story?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="170"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Did I told you the story already?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I think you did. I think on the phone once, you told me some of it, but I --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah, she brought me s -- always a custom tailored aprons, of -- so I accepted that, because we were -- that was very fashionable in the camp office, to have over your dress a nice apron, yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: A regular -- like a kitchen apron?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, no --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: No [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- nicely -- nicely tailored.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah, they were pretty. I maybe have to make one to sketch how they look like. And from time to time she was coming pretty frequent to exchange, bought me a new one, took the old one.</p><p>And I always begged her, I don't need more aprons, and leave me the one. "No, I want you to have it." So, by now I am -- I was -- and later on, when all that happened, I was suspicious if they didn't -- if she did not use me as an carrier of her -- of her -- of her smuggled stuff, because I remember later on that the aprons had one -- were nicely sewn, but at the end, they had something like that, yeah, two or three seams at -- at the end of the --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And it could have been here inside --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Side.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- that she's -- was hiding stuff, because she supplied those I -- aprons to several people who were in high positions, yeah, probably knowing that nobody's going to -- to check their -- their belongings what they wear. And that's the way -- I have never spoke to anybody about it, but</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="171"></span> </p><p> that must have been the reason, yeah? And among others, she used me, too. So, what can I tell you? Then she collected the apron, and brought me a new one. So she -- I don't know what -- she collected probably the one which was full of stuff, and brought me one empty. And that's how she worked, because for what reason she brought me aprons?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right. Many --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Can you imagine? Huh? Then I have found an -- a woman, I still have to look for it, in Australia, who brought an story that she had -- she was sewing aprons for -- for -- for Rosa.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>Special ones, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Uh-huh. Were you surprised when they were captured, the [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: When she was captured?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you have -- you -- you be -- you were already suspicious that she was doing something?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I was not.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You weren't?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was not, no. I was not. We had -- she was among those people I like, and we had nice chats together, but she never recruited me, also. She asked me for favors, I asked her for favors, but that was normal business, like to help the people, yeah. And it -- because she has -- I knew that there are no Polish Jewish girls in the camp office, so I gladly helped her out.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now why was that the case? Why were there no Polish Jewish girls in the camp office?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="172"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because the camp office had a lot of Pole -- Poles, non-Jews. Camp office, and the arbatz einsatz, yeah, and the rest were Slovakian girls. We were there before the Poles, before the Polish Jews, and the Poles were more or less simultaneously coming with us around the same time. So, we have occupied the good places, while the Poles -- Polish girls had no German knowledge, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was among others there mi [indecipherable] their disadvantage.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And that's about it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: There's no more to add. Everything else is speculation and is blow -- blow -- blown up into something so that people can write. But Rosa Robbata was an ordinary girl, who just did what she felt is important, and she did it skillfully, and I don't know how she gots -- how she -- how she was caught. That I'll never found out.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay, we're at the end of tape number six, side B End of Tape Six, Side B  <span class="page-break" number="173"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> Beginning Tape Seven, Side A</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- Memorial Museum interview with Helen Tichauer on September eighth, year 2000, conducted by Joan Ringleheim, this is side A.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: May Lask you something?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Do you really s -- remember that everybody ignored me at the first meeting that's --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because I never had the feeling that I was ignored, I just have taken the people how they are, but I didn't know why.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: No, that -- that meeting, 20 -- I don't know when it was --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- 20 years ago.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It's my recollection, but it's not that clear, but there's some recollection that you said a few things, but people didn't want to pay any attention. That's my ere -- that's my recollection.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Who were the people with the --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I don't remember.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Did -- wait a minute, do you mean the other people, or you mean Einstan the lecturer?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: The lecturer, and the other people I'm not sure. It didn't seem to me that people were able --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Understood.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Understood what you were saying, and were able to concentrate on that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. So that was their bad luck.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's right, absolutely.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="174"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: What about you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I don't remember me. I probably didn't know what to make of anything. I don't -- I don't remember it, Sippy, I really don't.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So let me ask you this. I'm going to continue what you just said to me when we were off the tape. When -- when Anna Polarchik was being interviewed, she made some statement that she thought you were in the underground.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It's on her interview, in Polish.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right, right, right, right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not she thinks, she is sure.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: She's sure. Okay. So what -- what is it about what you were doing that would make somebody think that -- that you might have been in --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Thad an daily visitor, and that was a man, an Pole, who was known -- who was the only man who was living in the women's camp. And his name was En -- Hen -- Henyek Borepsky. Henyek Borepsky was the official electrician, who was in charge of checking the wirings, electric wiring, all over the whole area. Henyek Borepsky was the one who buried s -- many of the Jewish and non-Jewish reports the people wrote in all their languages, in -- who buried that during our stay there, and then after the war, made it possible to un-bury the stuff. We have more stuff, the information we had after the war, thanks to him, and due to him. Now, he isn't -- he isn't quoted in most of the literature by important historians, like Lunkbine mentioned him too, but he is described very well in the book by -- called "Fighting Auschwitz," yeah?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: By Garlinsky.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="175"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: As he visited me every day, she didn't know what business he has to do with me, yeah? Who am -- what -- otherwise he -- there was no love affair, he was not my boyfriend. He was just visiting me, and she doesn't know what we -- what business we had to do, except he was the representative of the top man, who was leading the Polish underground, yeah? So that why she suspected me, I must have had something to do with them. That's all. And he asked me for hundred thousand things to do for him, and I never have asked any questions, I did it. So, I probably worked for the Polish underground without know -- I knew I worked for somebody, or I did things for somebody, but I have not ask any questions. That was an very basic rule, if you do something, either you do it or not, and if you are doing it, don't ask questions, because what you know -- you should never know, in case you were caught.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So why -- why -- were there people that you refused to do things for? No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you trusted -- is it because the right kind of people came to you, and you trusted them?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because it was very hard to approach me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Why?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: For men. So -- you could not enter the camp office just like that, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So who --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And -- and you had no -- and people I have not known of through -- even if not talking to each other, but there were, in certain jobs established -- for example, I'1l give you another example. You know Gerovitch?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: He was an outsider of everything. He was an Bundist, but there was one leader of the -- of the Bundists, whom he mentioned in his interview, and that was Nonyek. Nonyek was an French and</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="176"></span> </p><p> Polish Jew who was coming from France. Later on, he became an medical student, after the war, and practiced medicine. But it was Nonyek whom was one day arrived to the camp office, straightforward to me, and said, "Sippy, I need the figures of French women, how many arrived up til now, and how many are still alive." Now, I could have told him, "Why do you ask me, ask somebody else," yeah? But I had access. He researched me before he came. I had access to everything, because I designed the card totake, yeah. So I --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Designed the what?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The card totake. The types of cardex.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I designed it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, I know, but you just use -- you used a word, what's that word? Cardatteck?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Cardex is an --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Cardex.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Cardex.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. So he knew that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I knew that -- I knew -- they knew that I -- I can have the access to it, because nobody would have questioned me, what are you doing there, right? So, I -- and two minutes later, I was coming with the answer. After all, I had constant reports of certain things, I told you that I did the diagrams and so on, so I didn't -- I knew exactly w-w-what to look for, and where to look for, and quickly, so that -- because there could have been any time, somebody coming from the SS, and so on. But we always had some people out at the door entrance to watch out. In any case, Nonyek arrived, and asked me for information. He got the information, which he reported afterwards, but I couldn't care less how, and to whom. But I know through Gerovitch now, in his  <span class="page-break" number="177"></span> </p><p> interview, that Nonyek was the leader of the Bund, okay? So that what I'm trying to tell you. I haven't ask him what do you need that for? When I noticed he was coming with something important, of question, he got his answer. And that's how I worked. Whoever was coming with important questions, he got his [indecipherable] he got the right answer. I don't know what I did, and to whom I was giving, and how much I did, yeah? Or that Henyek, what he have asked me, is hard to believe, but that's an whole story, you have to -- to -- Henyek was always asking me impossible things.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Like what?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: To -- to a shell of an watch, yeah. And t-to write down doxsa, that was an trademark. I said, "Henyek, you can get at Canada, as many doxsas you want. Why do you want me to write on that particular watch, which is empty inside, doxsa?" "Just do it." That what he said. Now, what he did afterwards with that, if they have smuggled something in the container, if that was just to recognize that it is an different doxsa, because my writing and my -- must have been different than the original print. But then, from then on, he was coming with similar mishugas, yeah, to do for him, and I did it. I never asked any questions. But I know that not only that I did something valuable, I have been protected by the Polish underground, just like they protected them -- themself, and their agents. That what I know. I really made my office available for their get together, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So did they -- did they just come in and say --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Nothing. The first time when they were coming, and all the women from everywhere were coming, the first time in, they said, "Sippy, leave us alone." I did that, and when they co -- were coming afterwards, and I left by myself.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: They didn't have to ask you.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Tell me how your reputation got into the men's camp. Irwin said he knew who --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Into what?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Into the men's camp.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My reputation?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yes, because Irwin said one day when I was here, "I knew who Sippy was."</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Huh?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I knew who Sippy was.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Before she -- before he met you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="179"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. Oh, that was different. I tell you. One nice day, Hessler was coming, and said, "Sippy, we are going to transfer you, I have now taken over some -- some duties at the onione factory." I, Hessler.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: "And we are going to transfer a -- you to the onione as technical draftswoman." I said, "But I was not trained as an technical draftswoman. I'm a graphic artist." He said to me, "The way how I know you, you know everything." That what Hessler said to me. So, I didn't know, but Irwin told me afterwards, while we were married, what happened. S -- Hessler was coming, and explained to the civilian engineers there, "We are -- we are -- we are going to get now a woman, a draftswoman. She's very peculiar, very exact, very moody. Empty fund room for her, bring in instruments, bring in everything. She will be as -- from now on, your draftswoman. And Irwin is going to supervise her."</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So, what happened?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was fighting, hiding behind Katya, and Drexel, that I don't want to go. And they were winning. I didn't had to go. And I never arrived to the onione. Good. So he knew that I exist, but he didn't know that -- who I am, yeah. Just a woman, a draftswoman.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. But he knew your name?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Sippy.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Good. Now -- then Mengele was coming. He wanted me as an draftswoman when he heard about me, as a microscopic draftswoman. There I was fighting again. I am not -- I wasn't trained as an microscopic draftswoman. But we will find for you somebody, and we have found for him -- what is her name? That woman who is now fli -- claiming her work?</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="180"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Whoop, the phone. We're back. That was the fax, not the phone.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So, that why Irwin knew about me. I stayed at the camp office, and that was it. But we wanted to talk about something else. You were just s -- putting in -- in that Irwin business. What was the next question?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No, I was asking you about the requests that people made.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: About what people's name?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What people were asking you to do.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh. Several -- several things. No people. I have been working for the French Bund, through Nonyek, and fr -- for the Poles.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right. No, I guess it was because you were talking about the Poles, and I was ask -- then asking you how did Irwin hear about you. And that's -- and that's how --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh, right, but that how, yeah?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Because that was just an one ti -- time when he was fighting for my transfer --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right, right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- but lost, yeah?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. That's such a co -- funny coincidence, isn't it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah, it's an funny coincidence. You know, the prostitutes in the onione, who were the foreman, some German women, Irwin told me even made fun out of me. They said, "Look, that woman, she makes -- she goes on the -- you -- you know, in German, mangeet umstreesh. If you are an prostitute, you are going where the stripe is marked, and that is called -- I don't know in English, if -- if they use the word, the stripe --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You mean on the road?</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="181"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. For prostitutes, they -- they are not allowed to cross.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But in Germany, it's a stree -- mangeet umstreesh, yeah? Mangeet umstreesh. Now, I painted the stripes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And then [indecipherable] then she made her numbers, yeah? And th-that was an joke, but it was true. Look, there was humor in Auschwitz, too.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes, I understand. Tell me something about revenge.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Revenge?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. Or let -- I can put it more simply. If there were kapos, or blockeltestes, or other prisoners, who were treating other people badly.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You told me a long time ago that you could get people punished. Katya could put people on a punishment detail.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. Now, I tell you what we did, and I can tell you that honestly. The book of the punishment detail, was kept in the camp office under -- strictly under Katya's supervision. But, as I mentioned before to you, that most book were supplied with plain sheets, only lines, and we had -- I had to put, or designs, or columns necessary for an particular situation, like block books, where we knew how many columns, and for what. So where the columns established in that br -- punishment book, where you had the names, numbers, the punishment, the duration from, too, yeah? Transferred then and to -- to be released then and then. And if there were some of the kapos, or some of the blockelteste, who accidentally, for any reason, had -- have been transferred to the punishment block, if they were lousy, bad people, Katya took the liberty to ask me to</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="182"></span> </p><p> extend the duration, okay? And that was the only way how we could take revenge on those people. Now, that is unofficial, but I'm telling you, that's what we did. And it was good that we could do it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So did -- did people understand that that's what you were doing to them --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Pardon?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- so that -- did people know that this --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I never menti --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I don't --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- to whom should I have spoken about it?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No, no, no, did they figure it out?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No. They didn't?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But you did tell me the story of one woman, who was a kapo, and that you -- somebody planted cigarettes on her, so that she would get caught -- this is what you told me, so see if it recalls --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I told you this?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You told me this. She was sent to a punishment detail.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And then she came back.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And?</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="183"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And she said she wanted her old job back. And Katya, or somebody said to her, "We'll give you the old job back, but if you start doing what you did before," I don't know what sort of a threat there was, but there was a threat. Do you have any recollection?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It's too -- I would have, if you would explain that the way I said it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, Pll go back.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I will find -- I will find --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Find -- find --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- how I put it down.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's better.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But I have to check my -- my fax.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Wait a minute, you have to take that off?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: We're going to stop -- we're going to stop for a moment. All right, we're now back from our little break, there was no fax. And at a later time, we'll go back to this example, and then --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah, sure.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- maybe you can explain -- you can explain more. Was -- were there any instances where you could denounce an SS? So n --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: N-No.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="184"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: If an -- if an SS was having an a -- a German was having an affair with a Jewish woman, could that be -- it happened.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Could be. Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, very great.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Why did they do it?</p></p></dialogue>

They're in danger too, to be locked up, and they are doing it. That I cannot answer.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah. And there were no instances that you knew of an SS --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Why that Jewish woman was falling in love with an SS man, yeah?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, right.</p></p></dialogue>
