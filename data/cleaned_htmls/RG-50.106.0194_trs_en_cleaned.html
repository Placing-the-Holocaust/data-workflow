The interview is conducted by Hannah Starman. Thank you very much first of all for granting us this opportunity to hear your experience and I understood you wanted to make a statement.</p><p>Matilde Neuwirt: Yes and I want to thank you and tell you that you are very welcome to give me this opportunity. So I will, I want to say this. I want to express my sincere thanks to MrGiovanni Chiampesan for his efforts, considerable efforts in locating me. And reviving memories that are very precious and the beautiful part of my growing up years in Italy at the very incredibly tragic time for most Jews. Also many, many thanks to Ms. Hannah Starman who is making it possible for me to speak and retell the events belonging to my childhood, childhood years in Italy. 1940 through 1949. During and after the war, as well as starting a new life in the USA. Now that I know from Mr. Giovanni Chiampesan that it was his father Leno who made it possible for the Jews in Sandrigo to escape before the Nazis came in. By supplying us with documents stating that we were Christians born in Italy, my eternal gratitude goes to Mr. Lino Chiampesan for saving our lives at great peril to himself. In recalling the events in chronological order, I will mention other people who opened their homes and hearts and decided to help this relatively small group to escape the evil Nazi intentions. In particular the Daria family, two brothers and a sister and they all took part in this effort.</p><p>Hannah Starman: So this is the interview with Matilde Neuwirt, the second part.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Possibly. But I didn't even know that. I know that when we went to Belgrade, much, much later we visited my mother's mother grave, my grandmother's grave. And we asked the keeper there, the ground keeper and he took us to the other graves and the resemblance was such that we knew that they were both buried in the same cemetery. <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Matilde Neuwirt 6 December 11, 2011</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: What happened to your aunts and uncles on the maternal side?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They all survived the war. They were in the camps; they were in Italy. And eventually we got all together, much later, as most of them went to Argentina by way of other Montevideo, Uruguay right.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. They were all speaking Serbo-Croatian and they learned Spanish. They, first they learned Italian while they were in Italy and then they learned Spanish and they speak fluently Spanish.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember that you were very small if you were born in 1930, you would have been very small when the war broke out. But do you remember the time before the war. Do you remember, was there anxiety about the war. Was there an awareness of what was going to happen?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not at all, not at all. Until the, there was like a big parade staged by the government. And they had, they had soldiers singing and you know about victory and what not and that they were marching with the cannons that were driven by horses and cows and all that. It was a very <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Matilde Neuwirt 7 December 11, 2011 primitive. Today it would be laughable. But they felt very strong and mighty. They never suspected that they would be, that you know taken over by anybody.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And that would have been when, in 41?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No this would have been already in 1940. And my mother got very panicky about this whole thing because some rumors. They must have gotten of people being taken out of their homes and to places unknown you know. And she had family. She had cousins all over Yugoslavia. They were not taken from Yugoslavia. The right then and there but she heard rumors and so she took it seriously and she said my children and I are going to my father. He says you settle your business and we are going to, and you will join us. And we started going towards the west, towards west.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Towards the coast?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Towards the coast.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But your parents must have been aware for example of what was happening in 1938 with the annexation of Austria by the German Reich. Was that --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: It's possible, yes it's possible that they knew. Maybe they saw it in the newspaper. Maybe they said oh well it's not us so it's whatever you know. And life just went on.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So when did your mother decide that it was time to leave?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In 1940. She picked herself up. We packed up whatever we had and off we went.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Where were you when the war broke out in Yugoslavia?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We were away from Belgrade. We were never there when they came to bomb the city. The Germans came unannounced, obviously. That was their way. They never declared war on the <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Matilde Neuwirt 8 December 11, 2011 country. They just came with the airplanes and they bombed them and then we just had to pick up the pieces. I mean news. Find out who was hit and who wasn't hit, but we were away.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Do you remember the putsch? Do you remember cause Yugoslavia was first part of the Axis and then there was a putsch and Yugoslavia withdrew its --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Was, so you see I still don't know that, that Yugoslavia was part of the putsch, because Tito was in charge. Oh no, not yet, not yet. That must be 40, it's all right. They were, I did not know as a child that there was a, not my sister or my brother you know. Neither one of us seemed to be aware of that. We were just following. My mother wanted to go away and so we went with her.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was the notion that there was a threat to you because you were Jewish or that there was a general threat to people in Yugoslavia?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was mostly a general threat.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you know if any other families that also fled at the same time? Was that a communal effort or did you go separately on your own?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Nobody. They looked at my mother as though she was crazy to leave. And all the way she had family. She had family in Sarajevo and in some other cities, not such a close family. She would stop there and she would tell them that they should leave. They should go. And they said you are crazy. There is no, no need to worry to get panicky about it. And so we went and they did not survive.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So your mother was primarily afraid of the German invasion from what I understand.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: She was afraid of that, of the bombing and after we heard that they bombed so, so much.</p><p>Without any declaration of war, war declaration or anything. They just came and they did their job. <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Matilde Neuwirt 9 December 11, 2011</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So what did your father do? How did your father react to your mother's concern?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He went along with it. He went along with it. He let go of his factory. His brother was still there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What did he do to protect his factory while he would be away?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't know. I really don't know. I know that he tried to get some money so that we would have, we would have some money with us.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So he tried to sell it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Possibly. Or he told his brother to sell it because his brother was not going anyplace and he was married to a Gentile woman and they had a baby. They were afraid. They said how can we go, you know. We had, wouldn't have milk, wouldn't have you know a lot of things that today people wouldn't worry about, they were concerned.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What happened to them?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He was killed not her, not the girl.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And the baby survived too?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The baby survived til she killed herself years later. Yeah, it was a tragic thing. She didn't know where she belonged. She didn't know. Her mother tried to be married and it wasn't good.</p><p>She married a drunken guy you know. And my parents stayed in touch with them and told them to sell whatever they found that was -- we had nice things at home. We were not that poor, poor you know, we had nice, nice paintings. Nice and they told her she should sell and use the money for her needs. And Melita, that's the girl's name. she grew up in that kind of an atmosphere. <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Matilde Neuwirt 10 December 11, 2011 Her, after her mother remarried, didn't work out and the stepfather was probably not so nice to her and that, that thing broke off. And they survived. They lived til she killed herself.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Which was when?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was when she was already in her 20s.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So after the war?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: After the war, yes. In fact she was already married and she had a daughter. Yes, she was married to a Gentile man and eventually that marriage didn't work out and I think that everybody was messed up by the circumstances. She missed her father terribly and she didn't know where she belonged, whether she was Jewish or what, you know. And her daughter was very smart and all that. She was in touch with us for quite a while and then she was so self-conscious of her English that she stopped writing us and she could write. She could write and keep in touch. That was Ragena.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Let's return to your flight from Belgrade. You left when in 1940. In the summer, in the autumn?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In the autumn.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you were headed west towards any specific place?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We were heading towards Dubrovnik.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was the plan?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We didn't have a plan. We were just going you know. Wherever the train would take us, they would, we stop, wherever we would be closest to the ships going to Italy. And at the time there was one town there that I don't even recall the name and from there we encountered the <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Matilde Neuwirt 11 December 11, 2011 Ustashes, who searched us thoroughly but not that they didn't search the children. And my mother had made because you know the bank notes, the Yugoslav bank notes were huge. In order to have anything there you had to really hide them somehow. And we had those things on us and so did my brother, my sister. They only searched the grownups and they had nothing on them so they had nothing to take. And they eventually let us go.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But they were not looking for Jews in --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: They were. And there they were.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And your parents had fake papers or --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, no we didn't have fake papers. I don't know how did that, maybe they paid off somebody. You know it's possible but I don't know. I really don't know. They kept us from all that kind of -- well I was ten and a half. You know today we tell our kids much more than they used to.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So where did you stop on the way to Dubrovnik? You stopped in Sarajevo with your family.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Just passing through, passing through and I don't know how that was done because we didn't have a car. We just had to go by train.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you traveled all the way from Belgrade to Dubrovnik by train.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: By train.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: More or less directly.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And then going back to, through Abatasa. There was a town, Abatasa that comes to mind.</p><p>And then we went to Italy. <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Matilde Neuwirt 12 December 11, 2011</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So Italy was considered safe at the time?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Italy was our, you know our next stop. That's what we felt, we felt that it was safer going in that direction than in the opposite direction so --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Do you have any ideas why?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No that's a good question. That's a good question.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So how did you get to Italy?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well the ship. There was a ship going from the coast, the Dalmatia coast to the, you know the Adriatic. We crossed the Adriatic and we were there and they said what do you expect to, we should do with you. We don't, we can't let you in. you're not --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So that was on the Italian side.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: On the Italian side.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you have a visa for Italy?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Nothing. We, as far as I know we didn't have anything. What my mother had I don't know.</p><p>Well--and she never, we never spoke about it. We never asked questions unfortunately. And that's how it was.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: The Italian authorities. They were holding, though that money was not stolen from us.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The other people. Some that we knew, that my parents knew and we didn't but apparently they were all leaving.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was his position?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I believe that he had a high position in the city hall there. I, in fact I thought that even that he was the mayor, but I don't know that that he was the mayor.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But he was in a position to issue false --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: To issue false papers, yes.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But were those people waiting for you at the station? The two brothers?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They were outside the station with a car and they couldn't come in and we couldn't go out.</p><p>You know. So it was a, at that point we were a little bit afraid. We didn't know what was going to happen. You know. But mostly because we knew that somebody was waiting for us. We said oh my god you know everything. But not because of what was going on. You see we were not, we did not get this feeling that, that people were getting killed. That's what's so amazing and, and there were concentration camps all around us and we didn't know.</p></p></dialogue>

So we waited for him to finally he, they spent many, many nights talking and arguing with him and what not and he was decided that he was going to go.

Uncle Bata was our uncle in the United States. He made us understand that we should not come back, that we should go because the partisans, while they did a lot of good, they had a Jewish group and they had a non-Jewish group. And they were not really looking very kindly at the Jews. I think that there were books written about that.

I think we were awfully lucky. And you know the older I get and the more stories I hear from all around of Jews that were in France, or in wherever they went you know it's just a horror story of more and more you know. And here we, it was just like being on vacation, like a long vacation. Sure we lost, we lost all this time from going to school and so we had to sort of pick up things as we went along. Some things I suppose we picked up and some we never will but school is not only going to the building right. You learn as you meet people and it's a continuous learning process. I learned a lot from my husband because he really went through the nitty gritty, he went through the whole thing. How he survived that's a miracle. Because he was in camp from the beginning of the war to the end of the war. He lost his brother. He lost his family, he lost all of them. With the exception of those who, cousins you know he lost everybody. Well Poland was really, he comes from Poland.</p></p></dialogue>
