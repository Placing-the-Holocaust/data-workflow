That was his interpretation. And yet had memorized, A have, his book with the poetry what he talks about this. TI can Settlerie not forgive and never forget. And my daughter, I never talk to her about my past because it's too gruesome. I didn't want her to know what people _ can do to other people. She was going to medical school here in (40 John Hopkins. She didn't tell me nothing. She just eloped with a "goy" and got married then John Hopkins University. Now she's divorced with three kids and I almost had a heart attack right then because she was my only child, and she has a Masters in Science.</p><p>She works in the National Institute of Health. But she also ruined her life. She was fourteen years with that man. So the middle one said, Grandma we're half Jews and half Christians. The oldest one said, he's ten years old now, he knows a little bit about the Nazis and bad people and he hates them; he said Grandma I hate all those people, I'm Jewish. He the oldest one said it because I --------- [53] by a very religious moel. But I can't talk to them about all those things . I can't talk to my daughter about it because if she could have run away with a ""goy" and leave it me, I have nothing to say. Who am I? In my heart I know what it is but the world forgets everything. This is very good what they're doing. I hope to G-d that they wouldn't demolish this memorial place because here we're going ten years from now...the blacks hate the Jews too. The Jews sacrificed the young Jewish men, remember Goodman and some other one who were killed in Mississippi? Jewish people sacrificed their life for them, but they still hate the Jews. Jackson, the one who was running for President hated the Jews. We have that other guy, what's his name, he's a priest, pastor...</p><p>Sharfton Beside him. No there's the other one, the muslim.</p><p>Farrakhan Farrakhan. He hates the Jews. At Purim he said what kind of religion is this. Because the Arabs give them so much money they do everything for the Arabs. That's what they're doing. They're preaching everything for the Arabs. So wherever you turn, they hate the Jews and I would like to know the reason. O'kay the Yankees[66] when I was a kid used to tell them because they killed our G-d. Why do the Arabs[67] hate the Jews? In Germany he said . 5 this porter[68] who was on television said we saw that -42"\}2eY=adu ene --[69] said the union or the Jews are running the world and we are going to get rid of them. So the reporter said that's not true.</p><p>The Jews are not running the world. And this was a Christian. So the only place which is a little civilized in that respect is the United States. Yetthere is so much hatred from blacks and muslims and goyim"#-PSdeg2-+ [73]. What's going on? What" going on in this world? After all this hell. I remember when I was liberated I said to myself, now everybody will love each other. People will embrace and kiss each other. There will be no more hatred. "A nechtica tug."

They loved Pan Bastocki because the doctors loved mine father. ?7?7[238] my brother-in-law used to hide all the Lithuanians from the Bolshevik what Poland took away from Lithuania the capital city so Lithuania was fighting them, you see. So if they would come to Lithuania in Wilno they would arrest him so my brother-in-law used to hide out very famous 2?[242]. So when the war broke out ???[very indistinct243] they : was hiding him for awhile. I can talk till tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow even and never finish so what did we got there?
