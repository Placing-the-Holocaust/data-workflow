That's all what they wanted.</p><p>Were you in a Jewish neighborhood?</p><p>Well, there wasn't such a - no, I wasn't in Yidisha????[180] that's what the Jews [indistinct180].

They said Molly, you wouldn't recognize it, all burnt and ey: the way the Russian built those houses like square that time @ 64 {indistinct 126] ceilings and beautiful decorations. And the ; terraces were so gorgeous. You don't make it in the states like that, too expensive. It's the beautiful architecture ..[indistinct130]. ys eee" Pere You lived in this whole building?</p><p>No, no. On the main floor there was the store and the bakery and the second floor was our apartment overlooking the Buffaloberg{ph131], the famous mountains, Buffalo mountains like Buffalo, you know, Buffalo mountains. Later on they made a big stadium for soccer one of the biggest stadium there is. From our window you can see the Buffalo Mountains. What else? I attended the Hebrew Gymnasium, you have it this, right? And then I graduated it was 1938 and I got married. Now wait a moment. 1938 -jg, I was - I was eighteen years old, right? So that's right, because , I was seventeen and a half, eighteen. And then I got married and the war broke out.</p><p>So you were married in "39?</p><p>Yeah, right, in the beginning of "39, March or April, I don't remember exactly when. And then the war broke out and then I had a baby; it says here when I had a baby you can look it up. I don't remember when it was.</p><p>When did the Nazis come into Wilno?</p><p>1941. They made a pact with Stalin. So we still were under the Bolsheviks, you see. And in June 1941 this was suddenly became without any - because they caught the Russians unexpectedly and they killed them, 22 million Russians they killed in the war. June 1941 the Nazis came in. I remember how the Polak was excited that they saw them. They were so happy with them. They should...[indistinct 150].</p><p>Because they were unhappy with Stalin.</p><p>No.</p><p>They thought that Hitler was going to...</p><p>Yeah, three years later they realize when 1943, 1944 they were erying their head off. But for the first couple of years they were excited. First of all they will get rid of the Jews and everything what the Jews had they will take it which they did you see so they were very happy. But then they ate up everything what the Germans -- and then the Germans made them go to work and they didn't like <span class="page-break" number="1"></span>  3</p><p> be? You are the young people. You have to stand. What can you , 72 do?. I took out some pictures.</p><p> I'd like to get a complete history from you.</p><p> Well, you have it here, Can you read this?

This is me -----------~-[87]. Okay let's</p><p> That's important. I""11 listen to that.</p><p> I went to Gymnasium Rialys, it was called. I went to Ele Sl Ea</p><p> [89]. Do you want to know the street, too? Zolwana[ph89] That</p><p> would be in Polish, Zolwana Street in Wilna, at the Polish time.</p><p> I graduated it was I think in 1938 but I think you have it there.</p><p> And I got married in "39. The war broke out I think in September</p><p> or October of "39 and I was marrried I think it was in April. I</p><p> don't even remember when I was married. You know how stupid young</p><p> people are. I got pregnant and I didn't even know. And I lost my</p><p> husband and my brother at the same time. They were running away.</p><p> My baby had temperature. She got sick so I didn't go. So they ran (p,and were caught and shot by the Nazis. I'm not sure if you have it : "in this. We were five sisters and two brothers. And we lived in</p><p> Wilna until the war broke out. Just before the war broke out I got</p><p> married and in 1941 my husband and my brother right away were</p><p> killed and then my older sister with her children. They don't</p><p> like this long too. They make it very abbreviated.</p><p> It is very abbreviated.</p><p> Yes, so what would you need to know? I was one of seven children</p><p> in a very very religious home, in a very very happy home.</p><p> Your father owned a grocery store and a bakery.</p><p> Yes. My father was a grain merchant but he was a rabbi. He was</p><p> very religious., okay. We had a grocery store and a bakery on</p><p> Portowa Street. And this is in Wilna. Wilnars7-4---[115]. Now</p><p> it's Wilna----------------------[121]</p><p> Where did you live? Did you live in a house or in an apartment</p><p> building?</p><p> i wih .</p><p> We had a house on ae --- [122] before I was born but then this was</p><p> a big building, beautiful</p><p> File:Ingster.Mol <span class="page-break" number="2"></span>  a million ants got killed by his foot but some of them survived and that's what happened, he said, to our Jewish people. That was his interpretation. And yet had memorized, A have, his book with the poetry what he talks about this. TI can Settlerie not forgive and never forget. And my daughter, I never talk to her about my past because it's too gruesome. I didn't want her to know what people _ can do to other people. She was going to medical school here in (40 John Hopkins. She didn't tell me nothing. She just eloped with a "goy" and got married then John Hopkins University. Now she's divorced with three kids and I almost had a heart attack right then because she was my only child, and she has a Masters in Science.</p><p>She works in the National Institute of Health. But she also ruined her life. She was fourteen years with that man. So the middle one said, Grandma we're half Jews and half Christians. The oldest one said, he's ten years old now, he knows a little bit about the Nazis and bad people and he hates them; he said Grandma I hate all those people, I'm Jewish. He the oldest one said it because I --------- [53] by a very religious moel. But I can't talk to them about all those things . I can't talk to my daughter about it because if she could have run away with a ""goy" and leave it me, I have nothing to say. Who am I? In my heart I know what it is but the world forgets everything. This is very good what they're doing. I hope to G-d that they wouldn't demolish this memorial place because here we're going ten years from now...the blacks hate the Jews too. The Jews sacrificed the young Jewish men, remember Goodman and some other one who were killed in Mississippi? Jewish people sacrificed their life for them, but they still hate the Jews. Jackson, the one who was running for President hated the Jews. We have that other guy, what's his name, he's a priest, pastor...</p><p>Sharfton Beside him. No there's the other one, the muslim.</p><p>Farrakhan Farrakhan. He hates the Jews. At Purim he said what kind of religion is this. Because the Arabs give them so much money they do everything for the Arabs. That's what they're doing. They're preaching everything for the Arabs. So wherever you turn, they hate the Jews and I would like to know the reason. O'kay the Yankees[66] when I was a kid used to tell them because they killed our G-d. Why do the Arabs[67] hate the Jews? In Germany he said . 5 this porter[68] who was on television said we saw that -42"\}2eY=adu ene --[69] said the union or the Jews are running the world and we are going to get rid of them. So the reporter said that's not true.</p><p>The Jews are not running the world. And this was a Christian. So the only place which is a little civilized in that respect is the United States. Yetthere is so much hatred from blacks and muslims and goyim"#-PSdeg2-+ [73]. What's going on? What" going on in this world? After all this hell. I remember when I was liberated I said to myself, now everybody will love each other. People will embrace and kiss each other. There will be no more hatred. "A nechtica tug." This happened all over again. So what's going to <span class="page-break" number="3"></span>  yn NS eet oS hands.. .2?&gt;[234] where to run, what to do. Jews are known for that.</p><p>They ?2?235]. They couldn't drink for that simple reason. But if you classy people more aristocratic people they knew but they didn't fight, they didn't give a hoot. They loved Pan Bastocki because the doctors loved mine father. ?7?7[238] my brother-in-law used to hide all the Lithuanians from the Bolshevik what Poland took away from Lithuania the capital city so Lithuania was fighting them, you see. So if they would come to Lithuania in Wilno they would arrest him so my brother-in-law used to hide out very famous 2?[242]. So when the war broke out ???[very indistinct243] they : was hiding him for awhile. I can talk till tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow even and never finish so what did we got there? See this is a book written - this is worth a fortune because there's no other one like that. I'm very mad. I will tell you what the reason is. ; { Ae <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
