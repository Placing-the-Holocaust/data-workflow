<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We're a very close family.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you well off?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: My father was relatively well off, you know? It's -- it's by comparison. He -- as a matter of fact, he -- he was a director of the Lithuanian National Ba-Bank. He was very involved with the Lithuanian government in exporting all the flax and flax seed and so forth. And he spent a lot of time in Kovno where the government --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- functioned.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you close with your father?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was close to my father obviously. I can't even think of not being close to my parents.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So tell me what that was like. Did you do a lot of things together, did you eat dinner together and have long conversations, what?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, first the -- my father's business was such that the end of the day, the people would come to the ha -- to our home to get paid for the merchandise that they delivered. And so I was involved in meeting all these people and listening to all these stories, and I was also familiar with the various telegrams that my father would get from over -- from Latvia, from England or Belgium, where offers were being made for ma -- for flax or whatever, and I would be involved</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> </p><p> with converting it from their currencies, to our currency, which was the lit, I-i-t. And I was involved with my father in analyzing the flax seed, because flax seed is sold based upon the percentage of good seeds, less any defective ones or less any other things which got into the -- the seeds. So that you would have to analyze it and determine what percentage is flax seed. And you would have to weigh them, and you would have to pick out all the defective ones. So I have enjoyed it, and I have been involved with my father.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So at what age did you start working with him and being involved in the business with him?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, the business, as I said, was always conducted from the house.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So, from my childhood days, seven, eight, whatever, I had the opportunity to observe him in business.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was he like? What kind of a guy was he?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: How do you remember him?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [remember him as a very respected citizen of the city. He was a Orthodox, but not that Orthodox that he wouldn't occasionally break the laws. He traveled a lot. He was very good in business, and he was very respected.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did he play with you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not really.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not really. Occasionally, maybe once or twice, he would accompany me to a soccer game, but it was not that kind of a relationship in Lithuania at the time between parents and children.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. And what about your mother, what was she like?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My mother was a very warm and a very caring person, and she helped my father in the business. And she also made sure that my father's family, for instance, would have sufficient money to make a Shabbat and she would go out and buy for them and bring it to their homes.</p><p>She was a -- you know, a very wonderful person.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did she play with you, or was this not a relationship parents had with kids?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was not that kind of relationship where parents played with the children.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did you ea --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: You played primarily with your friends.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You did not play with your parents.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did your mother cook?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yes, my mother cooked, but we had servants in the house that did the heavy work. And -- but my mother cooked and my mother baked.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And is -- was -- did you have a favorite food?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Did I have a fav -- yeah, oh sure, a lot of the food. I remember the tzimmes.</p></p></dialogue>

And I me -- I remember the cholent on Saturday, and you had to go to the baker and bring it, about 12 o'clock. [phone ringing]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: We have a phone, so we're going to stop the tape. Are we ready? Are we back? Okay. So was your family religious? When you -- you said that there was in some sense we -- you were religious, tell us --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well yes, my family was religious, my mother kept a kosher home. I recall going to shul with my father every Friday night, and every Saturday morning, and obviously every holiday. We  <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> celebrated all the holidays and my grandfather was very religious and he spent most of his time studying in the synagogue?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And this was your father's father, or your mother's father?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My mother's father.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't remember -- I'm -- ma -- whether my father's father was also studying, but I remember he had a long beard, and I would have assumed that he would have observed the kashrut laws and everything else.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now you said your father did not obey all the laws, that he wasn't -- what did you mean?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, there were occasions in his business, which would require him to travel maybe on a Shabbat.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh. And he would do that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And he would do that because he had no choice --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- a -- in order to get home on whatever, that he would sort of overlook that particular commandment.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right, right. What -- what kind of a house or apartment -- I don't know what you had, did you have a -- a house that you lived in?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We had an apartment and it was a two story building and we lived on the second floor and we were one of the few apartments that had running water, it had a toilet inside the apartment and it had a shower and a bathtub inside the apartment. And as a result, many of the relatives would come to the apartment to take a bath or a shower, or whatever.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And what sort of a neighborhood? Was it primarily a Jewish neighborhood or was it a mixed neighborhood?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, it was primarily a Jewish neighborhood out of the -- as a -- I don't know whether I mentioned it, the pa -- total population of that city was approximately 20,000 or 22,000, there were approximately 7,000 Jews. So the Jews were primarily the merchants in town as well as the craftsmen.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh. When you went to school, did you like school?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, you really had -- didn't have much of a choice whether you liked it or not. You just went to school, I'm -- I attended a Hebrew gymnasium where all the subjects were taught in modern Hebrew.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. So that for instance, if I had to translate Latin, I would translate Latin into Hebrew and vice versa. And math, sciences and whatever, physics, chemistry were all taught in modern Hebrew, like they do teach them today in Israel.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Was that unusual in -- in --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, there were several schools like that. There was one school in our town and there was another school in Kovno, and there was another school I know in Shaul -- Shaulenay --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- which is another city. And -- and then there were [indecipherable] where many of the religious young Jewish boys attended. They even built a school for the girls called Gavna, where the girls could attend a modern Hebrew high school.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did -- did you learn modern Hebrew before you went to school, or you learned it when you started school? This -- you started at --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I presume -- I presume -- I'm trying to think back.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I guess I learned it in school.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And you started in the school as -- in kindergarten, is it --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: In kindergarten --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And school had -- you would spend t -- in order to graduate, I guess you would spend 12 years in school.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. So I know that you had to go to school.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But did you like it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Certain subjects I loved.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So what did you love?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I loved math, I loved science. I -- I loved history. The subjects that I didn't like were languages.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You didn't like it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So that school had to be tough on you because you had to translate everything?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. Right, and I had to study Latin and I had to study Lithuanian and German, and fortunately for me, I failed Lithuanian and Latin.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You failed?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Failed.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now why was that --  <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was a failure.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You were --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And I failed Lithuanian and Latin because basically Latin, you have to spend a lot of time studying and memorizing. And I used to play a lot of soccer with my friends and studying languages was not exactly my forte. So as a result, I failed Lithuanian and Latin. And people would ask me, well how could you fail Lithuanian when you lived in Lithuania? I said, it's very simple. To me Lithuanian was like a foreign language because at home we spoke Yiddish.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In school we spoke Hebrew.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The only time I would have occasion to speak Lithuanian, if I went to some kind of government office, whether it's a bank, or a post office. But otherwise I really didn't have much occasion to speak Lithuanian, so Lithuanian was like another foreign language.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you didn't have fr-friends outside of the Jewish community then, so the kids you were with spoke -- did you speak Yiddish with the kids?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: All the kids that I associated with attended the Hebrew gymnasium, which I did.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So what did you speak together, Hebrew, or --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Either Hebrew or Yiddish.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you were good at soccer? You liked it a lot.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, soccer I liked a lot.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. Did you play every day?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Practically.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah? Were you on a team?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, I was on the Maccabee team.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And as a matter of fact I remember traveling to Kovno and some other cities, where we played soccer against they -- their teams.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you would play against the other Hebrew school teams, I gather, right?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right, right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, the World Cup is a big deal to you, I suppose [indecipherable] right?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: A very big deal, I been watching it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: L enjoyed it very much.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I sometimes feel when I'm watching it like I'm ready to push or pull or run.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah, right. Tell me, you said it was lucky that you failed Lithuanian and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Latin.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- Latin. Why was that lucky? Didn't they do something to you if you failed?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. As a result of my failure of Lithuanian and Latin, I was left back in grade for a whole year.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Which grade?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was -- I was then probably 13.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So it must have been like sixth grade, and as a result I went to school with kids that were a year younger than I was. Well, the disgrace, the humiliation of going to school with kids who are a year younger than you are, was so devastating that I wanted to run away from home. But when  <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> </p><p> you're 16 years old, where you going to run? So I remembered that a couple years prior to that, my mother's brother, my uncle, visited his family, and he came from New York, and he stayed in my mother's apartment. And when he saw the housekeeper bring to my bed in the morning and in the evening, warm milk and cookies, he said to my mother, you are ruining that boy, he" Il never amount to anything. You better send him with me to u -- to the United States. So now that I wanted to run away from home because of the humiliation of being left back in school, what do I do? I write my uncle. Now, I didn't think at the time that I would be able to get a visa as quickly as I did, but my uncle got busy and prepared the necessary affidavits, and he send them through HIAS to Kovno, and one day I got a call from HIAS Kovno that they received the affidavits and the papers, and that the American counsel would like to see me. Well, I went to Kovno to meet the American counsel. And as you recall there was a depression in the United States in 1936 and the American counsel had like 17 visas to grant for the whole country. But when he saw my application, he figured I am not going to be a burden on the state because I have an uncle who is going to take care of me, I'm not going to take anybody else's job. So he grants me the visa immediately. Now frankly, I wasn't ready to go that soon. But having put my uncle to all the trouble of preparing all the necessary affidavits and -- and all my friends knew that I had wa -- a visa to the United State. It is -- it wasn't feasible for me to back out at that particular point in time. So I came to the United States and fortunately, I survived. If I had not failed Lithuanian and Latin, and if I didn't run away from Lithuania, I might have been one of the six million.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. Hm. Where did you go on vacations, before you left?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I must admit that I went on my vacations to a place called Palangin, which is on the Baltic Sea. It's a beautiful resort, and we would stay in what they used to call in those days, a pensionne, which means you would get a room and you would get three meals a day. And so my pa -- in some years my parents rented a house in Palangin, and so we stayed in the house and brought a housekeeper and so forth and so on.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. I mean, you ha -- because we might have had a Russian housekeeper, so I would have occasion to speak Russian to her. I would have occasion maybe to hear Russian spoken in the house while my mother may be speaking to somebody Russian. How my mother used to love to read books, and wa -- a lot of the books were in Russian.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, how come your mother spoke Russian?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. Actually, the reason I failed Lithuanian is because I didn't memorize a poem.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And the funniest part is, during the oral examination, they ask me to recite that poem, well I didn't remember. But now, what is it, 70 years later, I remember the poem.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. As a matter of fact, I can recite part of it. [recites poem in Lithuanian]. So that was one of the poems which I failed when I was tested orally.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So how come you remember it now?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because it left such an impression on me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What is the poem about?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: This is the king of Lithuania calling his army together. And he tells them about the sounds of fire, and [indecipherable] and th -- and they should [indecipherable] themselves for battle.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, as a matter of fact, one of my close friends, we went to school together in Lithuania, came to the United States in 1939. And we have remained good friends since, always, and he lives in Boston, and he has a place in Palm Beach, so during the winter we always have an opportunity to get together and reminisce about the past.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. And what's his name?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: His name is Sam Sheldon, S-h-e-1-d-o-n.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, it was Shmukla.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Shmukla.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you experience any anti-Semitism when you were living in Lithuania?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yes. There were always fights between some of the Lithuanian boys and the Jewish boys.</p><p>However, since we associated mostly with our own, we have not experienced that much anti- Semitism, so to say.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm. When -- when you are 13, Hitler takes over in Germany.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="17"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you discuss this, do you hear people talking about what it means?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yes, we discussed it, we ma -- heard -- we listened to the radio, we listened to his pronouncements. And we were concerned about it, but not really concerned enough so that you would want to run away. Nobody really imagined that the Holocaust would take place.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And besides, my father was very -- he had a successful -- in business, and was dealing with the Lithuanian government and he thought, probably at the time that nothing terrible is going to happen to him because they need him. The -- the country wouldn't function without him.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right, right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I don't have to tell you that after the war broke out, the Russians came in to Lithuania.</p><p>They confiscated my bu -- my father's business, his accounts, his warehouses, and in addition they told him that he owes them taxes for prior years. And I recall receiving a letter from my parents that they need some money to pay for taxes, otherwise I presume they would go to jail or whatever. And so they requested that I pay, I think it's -- probably was like 2000 dollars to an individual in the United States, and he would arrange with his connections [indecipherable] family whatever, to pay them in rubles or whatever, so that it would settle with the government.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you had this money? Or was this from your uncle?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I borrowed the money from my uncle.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: From your uncle. Let -- let me go back a little bit. You leave Lithuania in 1936.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And how do you leave? Where -- where do you leave from?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="18"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I leave from Poinyavich. From Poinyavich we went to Kovno by train. And in Kovno we left by a direct express train tha -- to Paris.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: To Paris. Now when you say we, who is we?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Good question. There was a distant relative, my aunt's husband's brother, who was visiting his parents, and he was going back to America, and so they -- my parents arranged that we would travel together.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So we went, the two of us, to Paris, and the reason we went to Paris is because my mother's sister lived in Paris. And so we stayed in Paris for about a week, or thereabouts.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was that the first time you were in Paris?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. The first time I was in Paris, that was in 1936, and then we went to Le Havre where we took a ship called the Paris, to the United States. And it may sound unreal, but I traveled first class.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. And now you wonder, how did I travel first class?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay, how did you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, there was a depression, right?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And so there weren't too many people that could afford to go first class. So the first class cabins were sort of empty, and the ship decided to put a number of us in a first class cabin, maybe like six or eight of us. And so I came to the United States --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: First class.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- first class.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="19"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember seeing the Statue of Liberty?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I beg your pardon?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember seeing the Statue of Liberty?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The Statue of Liberty, yes, I remember s-seeing the Statue of Liberty because we landed in New York.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So we bypassed the Statue of Liberty and we landed, I guess it was either in the 40's or the 50's on the West Side. And there was my two uncles in the pier, meeting me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Wait a minute, two uncles?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Two.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You had -- two brothers of your --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: [had -- two brothers.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- of your mother?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: The uncle that brought me over --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- and his younger brother.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And so I came and I stayed for the first week or two with my uncle, and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And his name?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: His name was Aleck Leitman, A-l-e-c-k, and his last name was Leitman, L-e-i-t-m-a-n. And he was rather successful. He had a wholesale army and navy store and he was buying surplus  <span class="page-break" number="20"></span> </p><p> equipment from the government and refurbishing it and selling it in his store in New York. And so I stayed with my uncle, who had a very nice apartment on 82(tm) Street and Riverside Drive.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And my -- he had a -- he had a very American wife, who made sure that you mind your manners at the dining room table. And --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Were you not used to that?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, not the way she expected to.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was she -- she was tough?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: She was tough.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I mean, you'd pick up the fork the right way, you transferred the -- the knife the right way, it - - you know, by the time you got finished you didn't enjoy the dinner so much.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So you had to eat the way an American would, not the way the Europeans would, you --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Right, exactly.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- so you had to switch --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Exactly, switch the hi -- yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- the knife and the fork, yes? Tell me something, was it very difficult for you to leave? Even though you said it was not going to necessarily be forever, how difficult was that for you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: It -- all I can tell you is, when I got on the train in Kovno, I cried all my way --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Mm.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- to Paris, practically. I remember how scared I was when we crossed the German border and we had to get off the train and they showed them our passports, and our money and whatever, and how they screamed at us, and how they treated us, and I couldn't wait to get back on the  <span class="page-break" number="21"></span> </p><p> train. We then stopped -- the train stopped in Berlin I remember, and we had breakfast at the railroad station in Berlin. And again, I couldn't wait to get back on the train and to continue our journey to Paris.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And what do you think you were afraid of then?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, because we were ce-certainly aware of the Gestapo in those days. We were aware of the -- the German solution. Nobody believed it, but we knew what it proclaimed.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you think your unc -- did you talk about this with your uncle? Was he as afraid as y -- as you were, do you think?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, my uncle was in America.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was in Lithuania.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So I really had no occasion to talk to my uncle about it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You didn't have a common language between the two of you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, my uncle and I spoke Yiddish.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So we could converse. As a matter of fact, I was very close to my uncle and my uncle was very, very good to me. And because my uncle was spending so much time with me that his wife resented it. And one day she told me that her sister from Baltimore is coming and that she needs the room, and that I will have to find another place to live.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You were 16 - 17?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: 16 years old. And so I had to find another place to live, so the first thing we did is I went to the 92" Street Y. And they didn't have any rooms available at the time, so they suggested that</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="22"></span> </p><p> there is a family that's looking for a border, and they have a room, and we went to see them, and we arranged to -- that I would stay with them in their -- in that room, and three meals a day, and my uncle was paying 40 dollars a month for that room and board. And in addition he gave me an allowance of three and a half dollars a week, which I had to use for subway fare, lunches, personal things and whatever. But you know what? We managed.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You did. But that must have been very tough on you because you hadn't been here that long.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was very tough, as a matter of fact, I -- I would -- when I went into the subway I was overwhelmed because of all the trains, express, local, uptown, downtown, and I would go from my ru -- from my place where I lived, to school. I was enrolled in a high school in New York, at the Seward Park High School, which was on the east side. And the reason I was enrolled in that school is because my uncle's bookkeeper had a sister that was teaching in that school, so my uncle said to his bookkeeper, you got to enroll him in school so she enrolled me in the school where her sister was teaching. So that was Seward Park High School.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But did you speak English?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Did I speak English? No, I did not spe -- I -- I ne -- knew a few words --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Mm.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But I didn't speak English. So it was very difficult and very scary, but you go through it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you lonely?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was very lonely. As a matter of fact, I must tell you, there was a time that I was considering going back to Lithuania. But I didn't go back because I would have been admitting that I'm a failure again. Here I am in the United States where the streets are lined with gold, and I am the felda that had to come back to Lithuania. So, is -- no matter how difficult it was, you -- you have to continue.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="23"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So when did you graduate?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I graduated at the age of 18. When I went to school they gave me credit for a number of the courses which I took in Lithuania, and which I didn't have to repeat here, like math and sciences, which I excelled in.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And so I had to concentrate primarily on English and American history and so forth. So the first term, for instance, I would take English one and two, the second term I took English three and four. The second year I took English five and six, and the final year -- final term, I took English seven, I skipped eight.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes. And I got an 85, I think on the --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: On the regents?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: On the regents.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No Lithuanian, right? No Latin.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No Lithuanian, I didn't have to study Lithuanian.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. Did they draft you when you turned 18?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: beg your pardon?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did the American government draft you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, I went into service in 1942.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: 1942. So what did you do between "38 --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait -- not 1942, it was actually 1944.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay, so for a good part of the war --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> <span class="page-break" number="24"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- your parents and your brother and all your relatives, or most of them were in Lithuania.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You're writing to each other.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Soon as the war broke out --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: They -- there's not --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- the mail stopped.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So this i -- are you talking about 1941, or you talking about -- between 1939 and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I'm -- be -- be -- between "41 --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right, and 44, there's nothing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- and "44, no communication.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. But between 1939 and 1941, you are able to write, when they're under the Russians?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think so. I think so.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So this must have been very scary for you. I mean, you don't even have contact now.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That is true, but neither did anybody else.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, but that doesn't necessarily help you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, it doesn't help you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But you had to face the times.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right. Now are you seeing your uncle? Does your aunt relent a little bit so you get to see --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh, I ca -- I was in business with my uncle.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, so explain.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, I -- as a matter of fact, I continued to work for my uncle, and -- in his business, and as a matter of fact, I think in 1940 he made me a partner in that -- in the business.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="25"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes. He gave me a 25 percent interest in the business, and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And you're 20 years old?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: 20 years old. At that time I lived already at the 92(tm)4 Street Y, because by that time I was able to get a room at the 92" -- second Street Y. And I was relatively happy because I had an opportunity to associate with a lot of young men my age, and we were exposed at the Y to the arts.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We had -- were able to attend concerts, performances by famous violinists and pianists and whatever. And it was a fairly nice life. As a matter of fact, in 1941, I bought my first car.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What'd you buy?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I bought a Chrysler fluid drive., a bu -- brand new Chrysler fluid drive. Why did I buy a Chrysler fluid drive? Because I never drove a car with a shift. And the -- and the Chrysler fluid drive didn't require shifting, you just put it in gear once and that's it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Had you driven before? Anything?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Actually, when I bought the car, I didn't have a driver's license. Never -- but I had somebody who was working for my uncle drive with me and I took some driving lessons and I -- I must admit another failure. I failed the driving test the first time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [had to take it a second time, which I passed. It was really funny, you get -- you have a car and you don't have a driver's license.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="26"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Where did you keep the car?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Ina garage next to the 92"C/ Street Y. As a matter of fact, you know Mr. Haberman who writes a column in the New York Times?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He interviewed me at the time, and he said, well how much rent did you pay at the Y? I said five dollars a week. And where did you garage the car? I said down the street. And how much did you pay for the garage? And I said 25 dollars a month. He says, you paid five dollars a week for a room, 25 dollars a month for garaging your car? But, as a matter of fact, I then moved to a residential hotel on the west side, I think it was on 84" Street, between Amsterdam -- no, near the Riverside Drive. And that was -- I had beautiful accommodations, yeah. It was a studio with a kitchenette which was closed in with doors. Beautiful furniture. Had a restaurant in the buil -- in the building, and had an indoor swimming pool.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So by that time I was already rich.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. What were you doing as a partner? What was your role?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, at that time we were engaged in manufacturing for the government.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: For the what?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: For the United States government.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And it was my job to, when we got requests from the government to bid on certain items, to break down the drawings and specifications and prepare a bill of materials, estimate the labor</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="27"></span> </p><p> and then submit a bid to the government. So that was primarily my job, and because I was pretty good in math and sciences, and [indecipherable] material and so forth, I was able to calculate and to price it out. And we were at a -- very successful in that business.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And what were you actually doing for the government once you --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, we were making various items for the government. One of the first contracts -- I remember getting a big contract, was for helmet lines. It was an aluminum frame covered with calfskin leather which would fit into the helmet. I remember making sleeping bags. That's a funny story, Phyllis always tells me about it -- reminds me about it. I --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, you know something, let's -- let's go to the next tape, cause I have the feeling it's going to go on for a bit longer, so let's stop this tape.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>End of Tape Two  <span class="page-break" number="28"></span> </p><p> Beginning Tape Three</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay. We" ll -- we" ll talk --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, one of the f-first contracts that we got was to manufacture sleeping bags for the air force. Now that sleeping bag was filled with down. I didn't even know what the word down was.</p><p>And so [ had to prepare a bid and calculate the cost of the materials, and I start calling around to find out about the price of down, and where do you get that? Well, basically you had the Yellow Pages, and you open up the Yellow Page, and you look f -- f -- under down for manufacturers on down, and we had to utilize a hundred percent down. When I called the suppliers and I ask them for hundred percent down, they said there is no such thing as hundred percent down. Hundred percent down contains probably 10 percent little feathers. Well, I said my specification calls for a hundred percent down, I can't use little feathers. Well, they said, you're not going to find anybody that makes hundred percent down, per se. And so anyhow, I was able to get a price on -- be so-called hundred percent down and we submitted a bid to the government and we got the contract. And it was one of the first contracts where I got myself familiarized with the term down. But there were many other contracts which we received at the time. We made bandoliers, where the soldiers kept their shells or whatever.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Is that like a belt?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. We made firemen's clothing from an aluminized asbestos cloth which would enable the firemen to go in and rescue say, a pilot under 2,000 degree temperature. We made the helmet, we made the gloves, we made the -- a jacket and trousers. We made parachute drop equipment. We made targets, tow targets. So the tow targets were made, some were wound tow targets which were made from cloth, and other tow targets were made from sort of a mesh material.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What's a tow target, what is that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="29"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Tow targets, well, in order for the pilots to practice --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- gunnery in a plane, they need a target --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- to fire. So there is one plane that has attached to it, a target --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I see.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- which they towed behind the plane.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, a tow tar -- I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: A tow target.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And so that the other pilots or whatever, fighters, would aim their bullets into that particular target.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And that when they fired the bullet in that target, it would leave a mark --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- in the tow target, so they would know which pilot, or whatever, registered on the target --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right, right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- and so forth. So we made tow targets. We made many things which the government needed at the time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So were you a kind of middle person and contracted out, or did he have a factory that did all -</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: We had a factory that made it all.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="30"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We made it ourself.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Wow.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: We were our own contractors. So we started with the raw material, and we sold the finished item, and we had, you know, government inspectors at -- on the premises --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- at all times to make sure that we meet the government specifications.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And that was another challenge because when you deal with the government, there is no right way, there is no wrong way, it's only the army way. And when they tell you you -- you s -- sew it with 10 stitches per inch, it better be 10 stitches per inch. Nine will not do, 11 will not do, it better be 10. And so that you had to follow explicitly the government specifications.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And that was a challenge.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I bet. Now let me ask you something, cause it strikes me that you -- I don't know if you feel somewhat schizophrenic in the United States when you're 20 and 21, but when the war happens, and your family is over there, and you're here relatively safe, that must be really hard for you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>You're reading newspapers, you're hearing the news on the radio.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, you know, you hear the news and you never heard really of the atrocities which were committed.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: At least that is my recollection.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So during --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="31"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We knew there was a problems, we knew it was difficult, but we never imagined that there were concentration camps, we never imagined that there were gas chambers and whatever.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And we -- I didn't know, for instance, that my mother was killed practically the day that the Germans marched into Lithuania.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: With the Einsatzgrup, I guess, you -- you think she was shot?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, not only do I think, I know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You know she was shot.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: What happened is that -- and it -- actually I'm -- I'm ashamed to say it, it was the Lithuanians that gathered the entire population of this Jews of the city Poinyavich, marched them to the suburbs, made them dig trenches and machine gunned the entire 7,000, men, women, children, the whole thing. And what is so i-interesting is that the Germans kept meticulous records of the destruction of the Jewish people, and that episode of the killing of the Jews in Lithuania, appears among the papers --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Of the Germans.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- of the Germans.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And where is your father, and now your brother?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: My brother -- my mother the -- realized the situation in Poinyavich was rather hazardous, so she sent my brother to Kovno to tell my father not to come back. So my brother went to Kovno to tell my father what the situation is, and that my mother said don't come back. And what happened is that my brother, and my father, who were in Kovno, were placed in the Kovno ghetto. And they stayed in the Kovno ghetto I think about a year and a half or two years. They</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="32"></span> </p><p> were then transferred to Dachau, and it was in Dachau that my father died, really from starvation, because whatever meager rations he received, he gave to my brother --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- so that he should survive.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And when do you find all this out, if during the war you don't know anything? Is it long after the war, right after the war?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, right after the war I remember seeing a list of survivors which was published by the American Red Cross, and my father's name appeared there as being killed in Dachau, and it also appeared that my brother survived. And then I heard from other people, relatives and whatnot, that my brother survived, and he is in Europe. It seems that my brother tried to get in touch with me, but he didn't have the right address because since that -- since he had the address when I left home, we moved and so forth. And I never received any mail from him. And he was in -- I guess in a camp, and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You mean when he was in the DP camp afterwards, yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In -- yes, right. S-So my brother wasn't exactly sure what happened to my mother. So he went back to Poinyavich to look for my mother. And, you know, at that time the former Soviet Union was in charge of Lithuania, the Iron Curtain came down, so you were able to get into Lithuania, but you couldn't get out.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So he's stuck.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Stuck. By the time I was able to establish contact with my brother, he was married, he had a child, a wife, in-laws, and it was not feasible to smuggle him out from Lithuania.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So that --</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="33"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So what year is this when you -- when you s --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was -- well, the end of the war was 1945, and he got married at the end of "45. I think the child was born in "46, so -- and I was not able to communicate with my brother directly, so it seems that all the letters which I sent to him, and the return address which he sent to me, went through a third party. He was afraid that if the Russians find out that he has a brother in the United States, a capitalist, whatever, that he will lose his job because at one point he had a very good job in Poinyavich right after the war, but then somebody said, you know, his father was a capitalist and he has a brother capitalist and so he got fired, because his brother is a capitalist and his father was a capitalist. So he was afraid to disclose that he has a brother in the United States.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>However, in subsequent years, I sent him packages. Again, not directly to him, but through a third party, and he would be able to barter the packages for either food, or for whatever else, or sell it, and that has enabled him to live a better life than otherwise. So with the help of the packages which I sent him regularly for many years, he subsequently is a very capable man, spoke Lithuanian fluently, spoke Russian fluently, spoke Yiddish fluently, all these things which I couldn't do, he was able to do very well. And so he got a -- a very significant job with the Russian government and he was in charge of food distribution for the -- for Wilna and it's surrounding. Well, that was a very big job because with food you cou -- in those days, you could trade and help people in many ways. The story goes, supposedly, I don't know whether it's true or not, but when the president of Lithuania, the prime minister had a birthday party and he needed vodka or food or whatever, he had to get permission from my brother to get these supplies. So he had a fairly good job, and then he was in charge also of their hotels which -- which were built to cater to foreign dignitaries. So that he had occasion to go to all the Russian -- to Czechoslovakia, to some of the other Russian countries, whatever, and learn how to run a -- an</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="34"></span> </p><p> outs -- what I would call a hotel that caters to dignitaries. And he had a fairly good life. The first time I actually met -- saw my brother since I left home in 1936 was in 1988. That's 52 years later. And I met my brother in Israel. It seems that a Maccabee team from Lithuania came to Israel to participate in the games and my brother was very much involved with the soccer team in Lithuania, and so he came, he got permission to travel with the team to Israel for the soccer games. And that is the first time that I met -- I saw my brother after 52 years.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was that like?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was very difficult to say the leas -- the least, but you know, he -- he is a very outgoing person, very -- very able, and he -- if I say so myself, he adored me, because I am his source of survival. And I finally convinced him in 1988 to move to Israel, because he had such a good job in Lithuania. He had a car, he had a dacha, he had computers, he had everything. And here he has to give it all up and move to Israel where his children don't speak the language, where -- well, he spoke some Hebrew because he went to a Hebrew high school, but it's starting a whole new life.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So [had to promise him that I will get him a condominium for him, a condominium for his daughter, for his son. I will get them cars, and I will make sure that they will be able to live in relative comfort in Israel. And it was only after these promises that he has agreed to move to Israel. So in 1989, I think, he moved to Israel.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you want him to move to the United States?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Really, I don't think he would have been as happy in the United States as he was in Israel.</p><p>First of all, there was a big migration of Soviet Jews to Israel. So a lot of his friends came --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="35"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- to Israel. It would have been a -- much more difficult for him and for his family to acclimate to a life in the United States.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And they were allowed to leave in "89?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: IL beg your pardon?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: They were allowed to leave Lithuania?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: To leave Lithuania, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That was okay?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, what is this like? You left, you were 16, he was 10, and when you see him, he's in his 60's, yes?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And it -- it's a --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- y-you're right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: It's a huge --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: It -- it -- it's a huge -- you know, I sometimes wonder, really what do we have in common?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And what we have in common is basically our parents and our Jewish tradition, and my responsibility since my father was killed, that I had to take over and provide for the family. But we didn't have this close relationship that normally brothers have.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We lived in different worlds. I lived in the United States, and he lived in Russia. We were both very comfortable, he in Russia and I in the United States.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="36"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. But he also was in the ghetto, which had to have been a very difficult experience with - - with your father. Did he talk about that with you at all?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, actually he never really wanted to discuss his life in the ghetto, or his life in Dachau. He did tell me about Dachau that when the Americans were nearing Dachau that the Germans decided to vacate the camp, and they decided to march them east. And he tells me the story that while they were marching in the -- through the woods, and his feet, he -- were bleeding, he was exhausted, and he tells me that he couldn't take it any more and he and a friend of his decided to fall to the ground, and whatever it is, it is. And he tells me the story about this German soldier that came across him and said to his friend, don't waste a bullet on him, he is dead. And so they passed by and he then wi -- with his friend, ran to find food or shelter, or whatever. And they came across a farm and when they knocked on the door, the Germans were frightened obviously and they said wa -- all we want is some food and -- and some water, whatever. And the Germans said, we don't have any food, but the American army is across on that river, and if you cross that bridge, y-you'll find the American army and they will be able to help you. And you better hurry up because the bridge is going to be blown up. So with whatever strength he and his friend had, they ran across the river and no sooner did they get to the other side of the river, the bridge blew up. But by that time they were on the side where the Americans were, and so they received food, shelter and so forth from the American army.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But that's all he was [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's all he -- but he wouldn't have -- he wouldn't tell me about the -- his experiences in Dachau, about the killings in Dachau. You know, he didn't a -- and he didn't discuss -- he doesn't discuss much about his life in the ghetto, either. Although, I understand from some cousins of mine that when he was in the ghetto, my father arranged for him to get married in the  <span class="page-break" number="37"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> ghetto. And he must have been then -- what wa -- 16 - 17, and that his wife was taken away, and -- from the ghetto or whatever, and he never saw her again.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And -- but he didn't tell you this. It was other people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He didn't -- he didn't tell me that, because I don't think his current wife knows about it, that he was married.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see. And is -- was his current wife a Lithuanian Gentile, or was she Jewish?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, she a Jewish girl.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: She's a Jewish girl.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It's when he went back to Lithuania, to Poinyavich to look for my mother, he came across that Jewish family, they took him in. They had a daughter, they got married and before you knew there was a baby. And the other -- the only other thing he tells me is that he was able to reclaim my father's home. And he then sold the house, which belonged to my father, and no sooner did he sell the house that that money became devalued. That he told me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. Tell me something. What -- if you can answer this question, what sort of effect does this history have on you, the fact that your mother was murdered and your father got killed.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, it had -- it -- obviously it's a very central part of my life. This is why Iam so committed to Israel. This is why I am committed to the importance of the state of Israel, because it's my view that if we had an Israel at the time, we had a place that would have admitted Jews, maybe my parents could have been saved, and my parents wou -- with not only my parents, with my grandparents, my uncles, my cousins, everybody else that was killed by the Lithuanians in 1941.</p><p>So I have done a number of things to memorialize it. One of the things which I always hoped, that I would be able to bring my parents over, and to give them the type -- the kind of lifestyle that they gave me when I was a kid. And obviously that was not to be. So I got involved in</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="38"></span> </p><p> building a geriatric center. And I felt, while I may not be able to take care of my parents, I will be able to take care of other parents, who will be able to finish their years in a home where they could -- are surrounded by their own people, and they would spend the rest of their life in dignity, and -- so we build this communities -- this geriatric center, which is called the Gurwin Jewish geriatric center. It's in Commack, Long Island, and it is an -- if I say so myself, an outstanding geriatric center. It has 460 beds, it has another 120 daycare patients, and it has apartments with assisted living for 200 units. And so I have devoted a lot of time, effort and energy to build this geriatric center, and to maintain it in a style which would be a credit to the Jewish community.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: We're gonna -- I'm going to have to break now for the tape.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>End of Tape Three  <span class="page-break" number="39"></span> </p><p> Beginning Tape Four</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay. You were continuing to talk about the -- the ways in which you have been affected by the Holocaust and what you've done because of it.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, because of that, I have been a leader in the UJA Federation of New York. I was chairman of the board for three, four years, and -- think it was between 1987 and 1990. I am very supportive of all Jewish causes. I have sent up two satellites called Gurwin one and two. They were built in Israel, they were designed by Technion, built by Israel aircraft industry and they were launched on a Russian missile from Kazakhstan.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. The first satellite went kaput.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You mean it just blew up?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Because --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Oke --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- the Russian missile did not ignite the fourth stage, so it never got into orbit.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And -- and so I said it was not the fault of Technion, it was the fault of the Russian missile, so we're going to build a second one. So we have a second satellite, that's why it's called Gurwin two, and it is still circling --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Really?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- the world to this day. It was originally designed that it would last probably a year or two at the most. It's now six or seven years and it's still in orbit.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Wow.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="40"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So that was one of the things which I did. I am on the board of Technion and I'm also on the board of the Weizmann Institute of Science. And I am very supportive of both institutions. I have received a doctorate from Technion and I'm getting a PhD. from the Weizmann Institute in November.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's great.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So -- and I have been involved in every -- whether I was a guest of honor of ADL in Palm Beach, I was guest of honor of the American Jewish Committee in Palm Beach. I have been involved with the Magen [indecipherable] where we contributed, Phyllis and I, to ambulances which bear our name. I'm very much involved with the Long Island Jewish hospital which I am on board, and we have built there an educational resource center. So, we have done whatever we could in our own way to -- to make this a better world to live in.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right. Did you ever want to read very much about the Holocaust, or s --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Do what?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Read about it, or see the movies, or da -- is it too hard for you to do that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: It is too hard for me --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- to do it. remember going to see Schimberg's List.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: "Schindler's List", yes.</p></p></dialogue>
