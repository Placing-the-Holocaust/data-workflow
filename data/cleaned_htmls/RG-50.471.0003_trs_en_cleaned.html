And they told me the day before the occupation that they had planned on escaping with the Russians who were in retreat. And so there was, actually it was a very, very, it was a panic stricken Jewish population trying to decide whether it was better to run or to stay. And during this mad rush to get out, with the Russians, I think at that point already the Lithuanian partisans went into actions and fell upon some innocent victims who were trying to escape.

Who would round up mostly men and either taunt and torture them or, or shoot them. I didn't see any of this though with my own eyes because I have no idea whether the suburb that we lived in was more protected than the rest of the city.

The racial laws that, the Nuremberg laws that had already been implemented in Germany and other occupied countries. And I can be more specific. And, and mention that none of the Jewish academicians or professionals were allowed to go about their work.

The three of us were at a disadvantage because we had nothing to trade. So we depended on the kindness of strangers to give us a space. And after a long search, my father was able to find a pharmacist, an elderly pharmacist, friend of my mother's who had owned a pharmacy in my mother's village, where she had grown up. So Mr. Mesahovich and his wife told my father that they had a small attic space that they could spare, that everything else had already been spoken for. And that the three of us could have this attic space. So that's what we did. We, we had very few Video Tape No. Camera Roll No. Sound Roll No. <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection two.

I am very bad at dimensions but it was a long narrow space that, that held my parents" bed, on the one long wall and my cot and the sewing machine opposite my cot. And there was a window next to my cot.</p><p>I could look out. And I saw many brutal and memorable unforgettable scenes from that window. And just a very primitive door that led from one attic space to our smaller attic space because on the other side of the wall, another family um was living. And that family consisted of four people--a mother, father, adult daughter who was a medical student and her young broth- er who was maybe 12 years old at the time. These people became our very good and trusted friends and I would like to mention that the older son Ted Pace is going to be interviewed tomorrow and I hope to have a chance to meet up with him after 50 years.</p><p>Video Tape No. Camera Roll No. Sound Roll No. <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/BRIGITTE ALTMAN page 8 Interviewed (5-5-97) by Sandra W.

And because the work condi- tions seemed so wonderful by ghetto standards because already food was scarce and men had been taken away for forced labor. I'm not even sure what it was, it sound- ed like a wonderful opportunity to be situated ina safe office environment, perhaps even get a meal or two during the day. And then return at night. Because I wasn't working at the time yet.</p><p>(Excuse me) This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

So it we had a very short dis- tance to walk. We may have had a five or ten minute walk at the most. And we had planned to leave our house around 5:30. Well around 4:00 on that morning, I could hear footsteps, never ending footsteps. It was still, there was still total darkness. It was a cold uh damp foggy uh kind of late fall early winter day.</p><p>There may have been some snow on the ground, there may have been some wet snow falling. And the three of us my mother, father and i started getting ready for our trip down the steps and out the door. But before we did that I dabbed some lipstick on my mother's cheeks to make her look a little more healthy. We dressed warmly and just started out toward the square.

At the square there was, there was total chaos. Um, family units didn't know where to stand. Everybody of course at that point already had a work pass and was affiliated with a work group. And my father was, as head of, as head of the family we joined his work outfit. And he was working at the military airport doing just manual labor, construction work, digging, hauling rocks, that sort of, of thing. So we looked for the larger contingent of air, air field workers and we stood with them. And stood and waited.</p><p>As we were waiting um and at that point I think there were about 28,000 Jews in the ghetto, so all of them or most of them were assembled on the square. And um so we noticed that several German officers, I don't know what unit they belonged to, whether they were SS or some other unit. I suspect they were members of the SS and one of them was greatly feared. His name was Rauca, R-A-U-C-A. And he was, I had never seen him before but he was pointed out to me and I think he was standing behind some sort of table and there may have been a chair. There were some papers on that table and he was not alone, there were other Germans with him. I don't know whether there were dogs or not. I don't remember that. But they all had their pistols in their holster and possibly whips. Well as soon as a family unit had found their work groups, there was a little more order in the square. And I remember that we were still standing around noon. Nothing had, nobody had</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Or sometimes the even mothers with children were separated from their husbands. And the crying and despair was, it was just devastating. Of course our worry was how to get by, get past the in- spection table, how would we get my mother through. I don't know if it was the hand of God but we passed uh the table and Rauca must have perhaps was looking the other way. I know at one time he was eating his sandwich for lunch. And calmly eating his sandwich holding it in one hand and with the other hand direct- ing people to, to life or to death. And it may have been that during one of those moments while he was not looking the three of us were able to slip past the reviewing stand. And once we were on the other side, we were so relieved. We knew it wasn't over yet but at least we had reached a safety point, a safe haven. For whatever period would be allotted to us.</p><p>SB: And how did you find out what happened to the people going to the bad side.</p><p>Video Tape No. Camera Roll No. Sound Roll No. <span class="page-break" number="14"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/BRIGITTE ALTMAN page 15 Interviewed (5-5-97) by Sandra W.

Let me also add that 10,000 people were taken away on that day. They were led away and pardon me for backtracking but we, we came home we had to take a count who was still in the house and who had been taken away. So in our house, everybody except the old pharmacist and his wife returned. We went back to the square the next morning and found Mr. Mesahovich slumped over in a, on a camp stool which his, which his wife had brought along for him to rest because she knew it was going to be a long day for him. He must have suffered a heart attack and he was just left behind slumped over. His wife must have been led away. Shall I confess at this point that the two of them had tried to remain close to us and form a family unit with us and that I, certainly was trying to get away from them because I knew that our chances um, our chances were slim to begin with.</p><p>And I was afraid that if there was an elderly couple with us our chances would be even slimmer. So they did not return. Instead we found an old woman who, whom, whom nobody knew. She was sitting in a chair in the kitchen when we came back, exhausted of course, com- pletely drained of all emotion. And we asked her and</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

It was in a greenhouse. I worked in a greenhouse along with perhaps a small group of 20 people. And there were several pluses to this work site. First it was inside the ghetto. I didn't have far to walk, I didn't have to walk one or two hours every day to the airfield as most other people did. Who were doing the really back breaking labor there.

He was the brother of a former math professor. Very decent man.</p><p>We still had to do our work but it certainly was not back breaking. We planted seedlings and trans, I mean we planted seeds, transplanted the seedlings and grew them to the point where we could harvest all sorts of vegetables, cucumbers, radishes, carrots, asparagus, green onions. We were not allowed to take anything home. Um. It was a great treat to be allowed to take a few tips of green onion home and have it with our microscopic ration of bread, it was a great treat. And like I said the Jewish supervisor was certainly the exact opposite of a German guard who would, could have hovered over us with a gun or threats or taunts.</p><p>SB: Who was the food for.</p><p>B</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: It was grown exclusively for the use of German officers.

The hospital was burned to the ground with patients and doctors burned alive. The books were burned. Um. And it was just a very, very gray existence of hardship. It was so cold there was no, and the winters where temperatures dropped to 30 and 40 degrees below zero and people have no firewood to heat the premises. I remember, I remember that when we went to bed we covered ourselves with every feather quilt, every coat that we still owned before, before we had to turn in our fur coats to the Germans. But the existence was, it was almost on a subhuman level. Our microscopic rations, I don't know what the official rations were, I think some working people had some food supplements.

Actually, I never felt hopeless. Of course I, I had the luxury of not feeling hopeless because I was only in mid teens. But um, yes, um the young people still were able to see, had the energy or interest in seeing their school friends on the only day they didn't have to work. I think Sunday there was a day to regroup, wash up and so it really was a very, it was a very harsh existence.</p><p>Not only that and then either Ukrainian guards or the Lithuanian partisans would, whoever was assigned to guard, the guard duty would barge in and the German soldiers or SS would barge in for no reason at all and just terrorize the people they found at, in the home.</p><p>Mostly hunger prevailed. The people froze to death too. All of a sudden they disappeared, they weren't seen, they weren't heard from. They may have died from hunger and nobody knew. Because we certainly didn't have telephones. We weren't allowed to bring in a newspaper. We weren't allowed to have cameras or radi- os. All electrical appliances had to be turned in early on.

And it may have been the last week in March also. Everybody, we had already been, my mother had died several years before. She had died a natural death.

I think they earned their bread, their meager bread by doing um they were sawing wood for other people who needed, who brought home logs maybe had smuggled out some logs from the work place. And the, the elderly man had a good saw which he sharpened all the time and they went around doing this intermit- tent work and always took the little girl along.

The other hurdle was to get out of the ghetto.</p><p>All gates were guarded. It was difficult to slip through the fence, there were guard towers, that were manned at all times. And there were ways to slip out where the work group or work brigade as they were called that worked outside, outside of the ghetto and with the knowledge, it was usually best that with the knowledge of the group leader, one could slip away either to do some trading, bartering, get food. Either to make an escape or to return.</p><p>(BS--Camera roll 18 is up) (8 mark) SB: So you could get out with a work brigade.</p><p>Video Tape No. Camera Roll No. Sound Roll No. <span class="page-break" number="28"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection were to establish contact with a former bookkeeper from who had worked for my dad in our, in my home town.</p><p>Perhaps it's somewhat reminiscent of the Frank family's bookkeeper. This was a very devoted former emp, em- ployee who had known me since, practically since I was born and had always allowed me to have the run of the office and type on every, and play on every typewriter that I could find. She had married a Lithua- nian, she was herself a, a German. Of Russian German descent, who had married a Lithuanian, had moved to Kovno after her marriage, after Memel had been retaken by the Germans in 1939 and my dad had found out that her husband occasionally came to the ghetto on some business. Not quite sure what it was but there was some work. What is it. I can think of the German word, werkstatt like.</p><p>SB: Workshops.</p><p>B</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, workshops, exactly. Where uniforms, German uniforms were repaired and perhaps other repair work was done. And the bookkeeper's husband, Maita's hus- band, occasionally came to the ghetto. My father could not contact him personally because my father did not work inside the ghetto. He worked at the air field. But I believe that he passed on written messages to be delivered to Maita's husband, asking him if there was a way, if they knew of anybody who would take me in.

Well we reached the other side of the river. Yes. Everybody got out and regrouped. And I stayed behind and hid beside, hid behind some bushes. Waited until everybody had left and the, our meeting place had been previously dis- cussed and designated. It was on the major highway just a few feet from the small river, where Maita would be waiting in a carriage. And as soon as we saw each other we had to just get on with our journey. There was a, I guess a coachman who that was the only transporta- tion available. Very few civilian cars were, were available in the city. So she was sitting there waiting for me. I jumped in. We didn't say a word. Both of us must have been very, very tense and very, very scared.</p><p>And she signaled that we were ready to get to our destination and not one word was exchanged during the whole trip until we got to her place. And incidentally she had a very, very nice place. And once we got there we, we regrouped. And she gave me some coffee and revived my spirits. I think both of us were trembling when we made it up the stairs. And many things happened in that apartment also. Ostensibly I was going to be the maid there.

Yes, she told me that because the apartment was so large, it really was a luxury apartment on the main street in Kovno they had to give up one room to, to an SS woman who worked in the civilian administration.</p><p>And of course she told me to be very careful and not to let on that I understood a syllable of German, that I was there as the newly hired Lithuanian maid. I think she gave me a kerchief. Kerchief to tie around me head and apron. And some coarse clothes. Because I certain- ly didn't bring any clothes. I didn't have any clothes.</p><p>So yes, I had to be very careful around this, very arro- gant. I think SS woman. And I helped in the kitchen.</p><p>It was very pleasant. I stayed out of, out of sight when somebody visited. Went to my room. Until one day Maita had a visitor. A trusted friend, a German woman, actually a very nice German woman. And Maita was get ting ready for a party. Her husband also had dealings with perhaps German hierarchy or civilian admin, administration, I never found out.
