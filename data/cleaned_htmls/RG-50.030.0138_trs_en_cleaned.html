<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Would you tell us your name and where and when you were born?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My name is Masha Loen. I was born in Lithuania, Kovno, 1930. I lived near Kovno in a suburb called Slobodka before the war. I came from an average home. In Yiddish they would say Balle Batish, middle class. My father was a good tailor, maybe would have called a designer here and made a good living and I had two little sisters and one older sister than I am. We were four girls. One of them was born in ghetto. There was only three girls before the war, and no boys. And what I can tell about my childhood...I went to school. I went to private school, called Kommerz Gymnasium (ph). I was thrown out of public school. It so happened that I I have a terrible temper and the teacher said something to me and I didn't like it and I took the my book and I threw at the desk. On accident I think it hit her nose. So my grandfather pushed me into a private school somehow and I enjoyed it. I went to school everyday by bus. We came back. We came back home. We played games. We played soccer ball they called in Lithuania and we made Jewish friends mostly and in the winter we were ice skating. That was the main sport of Lithuania in the winter for kids and grown-ups too, and like I said, everything was going on just as it is till 1940, when the Russians came in first to Lithuania. They gave us Vilna, the capital back and at that time when I was in Kovno, a lot...we had some refugees from Austria and from Poland that had relatives in Kovno so they came and we helped them with clothes and everything else and I had a Austrian little girl friend by the name of Levine, Anna Levine. I will never forget that and I came to my grandfather. My grandfather was better off than we were and I said, Zayde, I need a bicyclet, you know, a bicycle for my girlfriend Anna. He said you know, Maraska (ph), I can't afford to buy her a new one but we'll manage something, and you know, he found a bicycle and put on a net in the back, and matched mine...very so much that I liked hers better than mine, and she was a beautiful girl. A very well-behaved child. My mother loved her very much because she thought it was good influence on me and I don't know what happened to her.</p><p>I absolute don't know. I lost touch with her when I went into ghetto because I had so much on my mind. When the war broke up in 1941, my sister, my oldest sister that is four and a half years older than I am, was a Communist, and she somehow came to us and she said run,</p><p> 01:04: because I'm running. And she disappeared and we packed up whatever we could and we ran. My little sister was, , the little...the youngest, was about six years, seven <span class="page-break" number="0"></span> very quietly back into Kovno and I lived in Slobodka and what I can tell you is it it happened to me I an experience today that with that . I, we walked into our <span class="page-break" number="0"></span> whatever they had at that time - I don't remember, and my mother says, and she was, you know, the little flour that she had she was baking...it was a Friday...and she was scrubbing the floor, and said get out</p><p> 01:10: of my way, and all of a sudden in about ten minutes, the Germans came in with the shotguns and pushed us out of the house and at that time my father, like I said, he was a better tailor...worked for Jordan of the ghetto...at that time he was the head of the ghetto, Kovno ghetto, and he was sewing for him and we got some sign [document] called the Lebensschein. And that is a sign to be alive and it was hanging in our kitchen in a little basket and she yells to me, Maruska, go get the , the...to be alive...the <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> was called the Grosse Aktion, the big aktion. And they went from home to home and they told everybody please leave your sick ones at home and Jordan wants to hold a speech.</p><p>We want you on this and this field. Leave your sick ones home and everybody has to be at this and this time on that field. So my mother was pregnant and one of my uncles that my aunt was taken away in the first aktion that I told you, had something very swollen on his face and we didn't know what it was. He came with us. Some of my aunts were separated. My mother's sister that we lived in the same house was separated from us, but my father's brother and my father's brother that was in the underground kept yelling at my father...he was a painter...and my father took him in and showed him how to sew and he worked with him in the Jordan Brigade as a tailor, so we came and we came on that big field and they start sorting and Jordan never showed up. They surrounded us with machine guns and they start sorting...right, left, right, left. And Hessel, I think it was Hessel his name - I don't know for sure - I can't remember. He was the right hand of Jordan. He comes up to my father and says you Bruder Schneidermeister, you brother tailor. Take your family and go. So my father started looking for people...you know for family, but there was no family around except my uncle with that big face and he said what's the matter with him. He says oh, he had a toothache. It will be pulled out, and my father saw that there's nobody from our family so he start dragging people that were behind and in front of us and my mother and me, and he had such a smirk on his face...I'll never forget...and they said all this is your family? And my father saved a lot of strangers and we all went and a lot of my aunts went away. A lot of people went away to the Ninth Fort, and what the most terrible thing about the Ninth Fort or the Seventh Fort was in Kovno is that at night we heard the shooting of the people. The machine guns were going "t-t-t-t-t-t-t" and what I found out...now these things what I'm going to tell you now I found out after the war...is that they were not shooting one person into the grave. They were shooting two or three at a time to save bullets and that were open graves and then they would put a chemical over it and burn them, and some people after it got dark ten thousand people to shoot into the graves, it took time, by the time they sorted us out and everything, so they didn't have a chance to burn them. Some of them got themselves out and came back into the ghetto, and this is how we find out what had happened, so what they called portable crematoriums in Sobibor and they called portable crematoriums in other death camps...that why when I talk about the Kovno ghetto I don't talk it as a ghetto. I talk it as the concentration camps. I talk about Stutthof as the death camp, because we did have portable crematoriums in the Ninth Fort. We did have portable crematoriums in the Seventh Fort. They didn't have to have the oven. They just shot them in. At that time they still had bullets. They shot them in and then burned them. So if they can call a portable crematorium why couldn't we call the portable crematorium on <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> portable crematorium...you couldn't call this a ghetto. You called this a concentration camp, and then we were sent to the death camps. Now I want to tell you one story that I always talk about and that's the children aktion. The children...1 was working in the ghetto works...everything happens that they, that should happen, like today I'm here in Washington with a broken leg, but that's alright. Everything happens that should happen.</p><p>I came to my father. You see the Jordan brigade, it was moved to the ghetto works and my father was working in town. You know, you would trade some things for some food and the Jordan brigade, it was well-know that it was bringing food into ghetto and would share. My mother of course shared it with with everybody before she gave it to us. My father shared it with his family. So you had food to eat, more than the average person, so what happened is when they put the Jordan brigade into the ghetto into the ghetto works, they had a separate room. They had a window into the ghetto and everything was...they had it better than anybody. The ghetto works but it still was not in to town, so that day in, very early in the morning, there's a . You know what...I would like to go out into town, in a brigade I said maybe I can bring something in because it's getting to the point that the kids are starving, you know. And they said...not starving but not enough food to...you know, we did our best. And he said you know what...I said you have protection.</p><p>You go in. You talk to the Arbeitsamt, to the Komitet in the ghetto works, so he went in and it was already late, and he said to me...that one of the men said, he says, you know, Herr Saposhnikov, he says, there is one brigade, a German and six girls to clean up a house...would you daughter be happy to do that? He said my daughter would be very happy to do it, so it happened that we left late and as we were walking out of the ghetto...of course every girl was older than I was, that worked in the ghetto works...we saw some black machines coming into the ghetto but no windows. Just painted little white windows. And I said to the girls, oh, that looks funny. There's something rotten in Den...I didn't know about Denmark...I was too young to know about, you know, Hamlet or whatever it is...and I said there's something wrong. Why are those machines coming in the ghetto. I a little panic, keep quiet...they're coming in...they're bringing some <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> same German when we walked out. There was different Germans, completely different, and something is very quiet on that street. The ghetto isn't moving. Everything was like in slow motion. And I and a man that was with the Arbeitsamt, the uncle Jankele Goldovsky comes out from behind that booth near the gate where the Germans were standing. He said, girls, you came at the worst time. It's twelve-thirty. They are taking away all children, all people over forty-five, fifty he says, and they don't have the quota.</p><p>They're taking everybody. And as we walk out from that booth, we saw about four White Russians, Germans, coming with machine guns...started, it was a very very long street. It went through, all through the ghetto, that street where the, where the gate was. And they surrounded us. They surrounded us and they start walking with us and I know I walked by that little Kommandatur, our little houses, and I know...oh, my God. My mother is at home. Even now I get goose pimple even if I talk about it. My mother is at home with the two kids. What can I do? Shall I run? Shall I make a run for it? Go see what happened?</p><p>And from far away I saw a friend of mine, Susa, with her mother, standing outside a door, and I couldn't do nothing and I start giggling. I didn't know what happened to me, and the , the German, he says to me, ah, laugh...in German...laugh as much as <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> know you have two little sisters. Tell me where they are. I'll go and help you. And you know, sometimes I was eleven but sometimes like I told you I was forty, and my mind start working. I said oh no. He's wearing a German uniform. He's having a gun. Even if I I tell him one word...I said you know I don't live with my mother anymore. I'm grown up.</p><p>I have my own place. He said you never told me that. He said would you like to see your father? I said, yes, very much. And again, my mother's girlfriends and my father's friends are dragging me back into the other side, and I thought to myself, what do I have to loose.</p><p>My mother and my two little sisters are not there anymore. I want to see my father.</p><p> and . And it so happened, like one time a doctor told me I have nine <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> realize it now...of course I didn't know it at that time, you know, but she was afraid at that time. And she had a little hole that she saw this machines. She saw those mothers taking the kids to the, to those to those machines. And people dragging them and the mothers, they didn't want to give the children up, was being beaten or a dog sent on her, and she saved my two little sisters. Now there was a rumor that...she was a brave lady. She was a beautiful lady. Good, brave, and that they don't have the quota. It's going to go on again.</p><p>So I said Momma, let me up with the children, up there, and you go in to the ghetto works on my papers. She said no, you go with your poppa. You're going to be missed and there's going to be something not kosher, and we went away, and she stayed with the children up there, and they called off again the aktion later on and she saved those two little sisters, and I'm selfish enough to think if my mother wouldn't have saved my two little sisters, maybe she would have been alive for a little while longer because she was a very young woman. Because when we were, when the ghetto was liquidated and we were sent into the death camp, to Stutthof, they separated her with the two kids and they took her away. At that time, to tell you the truth, I didn't know what a crematorium means. I didn't even know what a crematorium is. I know one thing is that when they were still alive and the ghetto was going on, before it was liquidated, we had to move them. Don't forget one was born in ghetto. My little sister Rosale never knew</p><p> 01:34: what it means to have one piece of bread and a full glass of milk. And what we did is, those new apartments...they made the ghetto smaller again and we had to move the kids, so the little one we put in a potato sack instead of taking part of her valuables that was left over, and the middle one, the one that was younger than I, we put her hair up, we put lipstick and we put her between me and my father and my mother in front, and we slipped through because we were not far, like I told you, for the German Kommandatur. So what happened is every time they made the ghetto smaller, we had to move them, and the little one was so smart. She was one and a half years old when they liquidated the ghetto, and what she did is, when she saw a German...she knew every German by the name...and when she saw a German she would grab the seven year old and say, let's go , and <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> very upset with her. We were sitting at the dinner table. She just came back from taking them clothes and food, and she and my father were talking and when they didn't want us to understand what they were talking about, they were talking in Russian, and I understood Russian. I spoke Russian. And she said, you know, those people are exaggerating. Nobody can do what they are telling the Germans are doing. And you know, at, as we were dri...driving into Stutthof in those little wagons and she said, let's go where everybody's going, I remembered that Momma said this once at the table and I was feeling so sorry for Anna Levine, that little Austrian girl, and...but I don't blame her for it because a lot of us didn't believe it. Nobody...a lot of Americans don't believe it. A lot of people of the free world don't believe it, so...because she was so good when my father would bring some food from the</p><p> Jordan brigade and first it was divided between the family. Then she would take it from us and send it to one of my girlfriends, her sister had a little baby...she would take away from Rosale with some milk and give it to Gitta's sister's baby, and a piece of...a little piece of bread here and a little piece of bread here and I don't know where everything went but she was the most good-hearted person in the world and this is what happened in Stutthof. They separated us and they took me in...you know, have you every watched the movie, , that they show the gynecologist table with all the dirt and filth. I wrote to <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> 0 still and SS and he goes through the lines like this, like a maniac. I'll never forget, and he said, "Du schwarzer Teufel Du wirdst Stubenaelteste" you black devil are going to be some kind of a post of some kind of clean the latrine or stubenaeltester, you know, the head of the barrack. And I was still braiding, I'm still trying, still braiding my braid. I don't know where my mother is. With the kids I don't know what's happening here. See, I went ahead of myself. I'm telling you back what happened to me with Max, and I said: "was". Takes me, he breaks my head and hit me on the barrack with my head, and I start bleeding. As the coming down bleeding and I was so confused I didn't know what was happening. Why is that man doing it to me? What are those people all around me doing shivering in in striped uniform? Where am I? Where is my mother? All of a sudden I turned thirteen again. What is happening to me? And I looked at him with my two black eyes...they were black and big at that time...and I said, and I looked at him and I didn't cry. I didn't move. The blood was running and I didn't do nothing. And that sadist that didn't have a mind of his own thought I was supernatural. That's what saved my life.</p><p>Every time he came into the barrack to beat up the women, every time we were standing in line, he was knocking out the soup from our hand...that little bit of water and ___ that we got. He never touched me. I didn't know why, because at that time I didn't figure it out. Now that I'm grown up and I know a little bit of psychology, I figured it out. He thought I was supernatural. How can I get help? How can I heal with a big cut like that and how can I look him straight in the face without crying. That means I didn't hurt. I was supernatural, so he was afraid to touch me again. And that's what saved my life in Stutthof and then when they were sorting out the people, stronger on one side, that he was drunk...other people did it. I think so. So we went and they put three boats to go out to those little camps to work. And I was in one of the boats and then they decided they don't need three boats and one of boats they set on fire, and the people start jumping from that boat and trying to get on the other boats, and that was dipping the other boats, and you know, I was sitting in my home and watching the boat people and I was crying and my son says to me, Mom, why are you crying? It's natural thing to people that and <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> 1 to a crematorium in Stutthof and put civilian clothes on them. But I still know that it happened in Stutthof and they...for me they died in Stutthof. Maybe they took them to Theresienstadt. I don't know where they took them. And I just didn't want to go on anymore, but you know, in back of mind was one thing - survive, survive. Take revenge.</p><p>Survive. Take revenge. Survive. Take revenge. So what I would I do is those little camps, they're always stationed near a lake and in the winter I would break open the ice and I would wash myself with the, with cold water and the tea that they gave us...the hair start erowing out...I would rub into my head, the warm tea. So Mrs. Gelta (ph) and ve <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> 2 able to run away, so I had that thing, but one of the guys...we called him Willie the Dancer...each of them had a name...he knew that I had those covered somehow. How he found out I don't know, so we were walking on the way and that German that I told you, that Poland, from Poland, you know, the Polish German, he tried and he beat a woman terrible and Willie the Dancer comes up to me and said, Maruska, he says, there is a big, you know...everybody was mixing together...the Wehrmacht, our fronts were going, and my step-mother's, my mother's friend feet, they're already frozen at that time.</p><p>Mine were frozen but not as bad because we were walking over the Weichsel, you know, the Ger...the Polish river and my heels were made out of snow, you know, because in the wooden shoes, but after it was completely frozen but one good thing about ; none of our people were shot. None of them. They couldn't walk any more. We just dragged them. Everybody dragged each other, so when we came to that...and he came out and he says to me really, let's go over to the...cover your stars, he says. I want you to go with me somewhere. I got scared to death. I thought he was going to shoot me right there, and at that time everybody was hungry. Nothing was to eat. If we got a half a potato a day, a raw potato, it was lucky. So he says come with me, but just talk as little German as you can, and I spoke a little bit so we came to that to the Wehrmacht and he introduced me as their Lithuanian Eingedeutschter, Lithuanian cook that cooks for the German, and if he can have some food from them because they took everything away from the farmers.</p><p>So what we got is we got a pig. We got potatoes and we got one of those big field kettles to cook it in. Who can open a pig? Who can do anything? We cooked up the potatoes.</p><p>The pig was already cleaned, but not very</p><p> 01:52: clean. We cooked up the pig, and we cut it up in pieces and we took it out in basket to our camp, to the women, to give it to them. And as we were giving out the potatoes, that German that I told you about, that beat up the women when he came out of the bunker, that said he was going to marry me, was holding his gun to hit my step-mother, my mother's friend at that time. I grabbed the gun, with the basket I was holding with the food, and he turned around to shoot me and when he saw my face, he didn't touch me and he never touched another woman. Never. And when they took away the black SS and gave us some different Germans, because they took away the black SS to fight for them,at Danzig, whoever they can get, , they had us in like in a camp. They <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> 3 That was...in their house was the commandanteur. They were friends of the family, and all of a sudden those two camps meet and Sochne works there with the...works with her daughters, and I yell, ; , where is Pave (?). Where is Taivele. She said that</p><p> is dying. She's in a in a, you know, wagon, with a horse. Perele had come back <span class="page-break" number="11"></span> 4 TAPE #2</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: OK.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: So we walked and we walked and finally they couldn't move us any more. And they put us put us in a silo in a village called Cheno (ph), and the two typhuses broke out and I was holding on and it's the funniest thing...you can imagine what Germans they always gave us, in the end too...that were the kapo, a German, that came to the door in the morning. He said, who is dead should say so. And you would get up in the morning and you would find dead people on each side of you. In fact one of the people that you interviewed yesterday, his mother died next to me. And I walk out...remember in the beginning of the tape I told you my mother would send milk to my friend's sister's little baby...she was a kapo in one of the camps, and she...all the kapos and all the lageraltesters slept in the village away from the silo because of the typhuses...maybe they thought they'll survive better. I don't know what happened. I couldn't account for anybody else except myself, and I came out and she was standing and the food...around the food and everything and you know, it's a blank her name for me. I can't even mention her name. This is how I blanked her out, and I said just give me a ...because I was getting already a temperature. I felt it, you know. And I said just give me a little bit of the hot water. I don't want any food. She said, well stay away from me with all that lice. And I turned around and I walked away. I couldn't even cry anymore. And all those things went through...her sister and her little baby and my mother giving the food and that minute everything went through my mind and I went into the silo and she saw that she did a mistake, and she came to the</p><p> 02:02: door and she said, Maruska, come here. Here is some tea. And I turned and I covered myself with straw, that I didn't want to know about her. And they told us that they are going to burn that silo and there was a little girl next to me, Chajele, that we'd spend the time together all the time, keeping each other, and I said you know that that piece of blanket that I have left over...you still can walk. Why don't you run? I can't walk anymore, and when I heard the yelling, I though they were burning the silo so I covered myself with the straw and I slipped into unconsciousness and when I woke up, I woke up in a home that the Russians are taking care of me medically, and before I even have a chance to breath properly, they told us they have to move out of there. The front is coming near. We have to go to Laurenburg (ph), so in that German house they found some clothes they gave us, and they gave us medicine and we walked a couple of kilometers and they saw...there were two Russians officers driving in a two-horse carriage, you know, in the back just two seats and I and Chajele are walking and I said could you take us? And he says no...we shouldn't, but you know what...we'll take you.</p><p>They saw that we fall practically down but we'll leave you out right before Laurenburg and everybody was walking and the shooting was going on, and they drove us up to Laurenburg, and the first house we walked in. Now you may think I'm superstitious but <span class="page-break" number="12"></span> 5 now I realize what it was, you know. There was nothing in that house except one bottle of black berries and it was standing in the middle of the floor and I...so hell, I don't care if it's poisoned , if not. I'm going to drin...eat a part of it. Said I'll eat it too, and we both fell asleep and we got up and we felt better. Now I realized that it must have been fermented, and we both got drunk on it, on those black berries and we fall asleep and maybe that's what helped knock down with all the medication that we got, and they took us to a Russian hospital and they shaved our head, because it was all full of thing. They put a green solvent, and you can imagine...I was forty-five kilo when I was liberated, and I looked like hell, and in Laurenberg they said said go and look for a home. So L...about three or four girls that looked better already that were older than than me...they say come Maruska. Come and live with us, because the Russian, they're, you know, raping the Jewish girls, the German girls. They didn't care. They were going on the front. They didn't give a damn who it was. So and then you had to sign typhus...they didn't even listen, so what they did is they gave me a</p><p> little bottle of medicine that the hospital gave me, and every time a drunk Russian, no matter how drunk he was, came in or something, they send me out with my all that green stuff on my head and like this and I walked out like a dead woman, and when they saw me coming they start running. But then my hair start growing in and I start getting a little better, they said no. We can't stand it anymore, so we went to the Russian commandanteur and at that time I didn't give them no . [just wanted to go home and see if anybody's alive. And we went to the Russian. They said oh yes, we'll send you home and they put us on trucks and they sent us to farms in Pomerania, and there's a story by itself. We arrive in Pomerania and there's cows, sick cows and sick pigs and sick things, you know, and they want, needed food for Russia so what they did is they opened a cheese factory, where they couldn't use the cows and they didn't know what to do with it, so the Russian girls that went...Ukrainian Russian girl... I thought that went the Germans were playing the piano and the Jewish girls were cleaning the stalls from the cows, everything. After the concentration camp and after what they went through so in one time it comes, the captain comes to us. He says who wants to go in Rickenwald (ph).</p><p>There is a veterinarian doctor from Moscow and he wants to teach you to be a veterinarian nurse. In two weeks he wants to teach us to be a veterinarian nurse, so I am game. I'm game of anything. I said I'm going. I mean, there we were also kept like in a prison but not as bad because we had food, we had clothes, everything, but we could never walk from one village to another without a Russian soldier. So I went to Rickenwald and it so happened...I must read (ph) of my father and I told the Polkovniks [colonel]wife, I said you know, you don't wear this dress. This is a nightgown. Put on this. I said you have so much clothes and I told her all the hair, you should do it, you know, that way. I made very good friends with her, and the doctor that was supposed to teach us was a drunkard. Was very sick, very drunk, so he would teach us about two hours a day. The rest of the time he would get drunk and after two weeks, he gave us a big stamp. He said, , I'm a veterinarian nurse. So I came back to the camp, and <span class="page-break" number="13"></span> 6 they put...Polkovnik came to visit one time...this is during the Russian. This, I'm liberated already. And he said I want Maruska (ph), Mar...Maruska at the table. And the captain said, Maruska at the table. He said yes. I told you when I telephoned you that I want her at the table. My wife wants to talk to her. So he saw that I am good friends with Polkovnik and the Russian soldiers loved me very much because I worked where the milk was delivered and were going to the cheese factory, so the Russian soldiers wouldn't get anything to eat, and when we came back, what they did is what they did with the cows that they captured, we checked if they have tuberculosis and we would cut around the lungs...would have the German people cut around the lungs and then the rest they would cut, cook it for the Russian soldiers. The good ones they would make conserves themselves. They opened a conserve factory and send it to Russian and so the cheese, the Russian soldiers didn't get nothing, so they would come at twelve o'clock at night and I would give them the milk and I would give them whatever there was. The captain had everything at the table, but the soldier had nothing. So they liked me very much. And Polkovnik liked me, so how does he get rid of me. He makes me...now remember, this is "45 and it was beginning of "45 when I was liberated and went though it. Let's say I was fifteen years old. I wasn't even fifteen years old, and</p><p> they send me as the head of the cheese factory, and they send and a big house <span class="page-break" number="14"></span> 7 owned the "gut"[estate], would lock me in her room that they couldn't touch me.</p><p>(Laughter) You understand what I mean. But they were very close to me, so the captain came to me and said I have a problem. I said what's your problem? He said I need seven horses. I said why? He said because the horses is in my village and my ranch and my Polkovnik and he said I want seven horses because is coming and only you can help me, because the people love you here and they'll give it to you. I said nobody gives nothing because it came out I think that the Russians cannot take anything away from the Germans, from farmers, anything. Nothing can be touched again. No cows, no horses, nothing. What's theirs belongs to them. Not far from me was also a officer, a Polish officer camp from the Pole...for the Polish people soldiers, so I said OK. On one condition. That you release every Jewish girl that wants to go out of your camp I said, and I want them sent right here. I'll stay. I said I'll stay. He says no, I'll make with you a deal. For every horse you get me, one girl can go. I'll take them to the train. I said fine, you sign it for me so I can show it to the . Lsaid I want to have something over <span class="page-break" number="15"></span> 8 nothing will happen to you. But I said I appreciate it. He took us to the train and we left and I met my father in Lodz. And later on, some girls escaped from there too, some Jewish girls. He kept his word. Some of them were released. They escaped and they told me that that guy lies ina hammock and it's catered to him. Masha they said... at that time I was calling myself already Masha. Maruska, what did you do? I said this is between me and that Grushin, nobody else and that's the story about the seven horses. I'll never forget it. As many things I did to him that he didn't know, you know. When I came back from Riegenwald, being a veterinarian nurse that I was not...I knew that much, all I knew is how to take analysis, a blood analysis from a horse, and somebody had to hold him, and how to cut around the lungs from the cow, and how to see that everybody, that everything is clean. And when I came back from Riegenwald after the polkovnik was there, in about a period of three weeks, the Jewish girls are playing the piano and the Russian girls were cleaning the stalls. But I was in danger from them also. So I had to run away somehow, so my father found out where I was from somebody and he sent that man to get me out of there, and this is how I came to Lodz, because my father survived Dachau and we met in Lodz. And then we had to go to, run away from the AK, from the fascists in Lodz because you couldn't go out. I didn't speak Polish. My father didn't speak Polish, so how...you couldn't even go out on the street. My father was working as a tailor. He hardly made a living, but one thing he did is he had an apartment. Everybody went to to Lodz from somewhere, one camp or another...he wouldn't let them go back to Lithuanian.</p><p>Always kept them there. It was a big, big apartment. Many people told me before I even came what my father did for them. But it was also a beautiful thing that he did and he died pretty young, and what happened is is we had to smuggle the border. So how do we smuggle the border. It costs a lot of money. So Masha went to work in a kibbutz in Lodz and made friends with the Brichah and took a transport in 1945...I wasn't even fifteen years old...in July I was fifteen. I took a transport with my father and my...at that time she was already my step-mother, Rochele, all through to Bratislava and the AK was shooting after us, and I stopped the people because my step-</p><p> 02:19: mother couldn't walk that well. She just had an operation in Poland and they were shooting. The people were screaming and I said I promised you to get you across and I will get you across, and I got them across to Bratislava. But I loved Austria...and I stayed in Austria after the war and I went to school there, and my husband was , before <span class="page-break" number="16"></span> 9 remember, when we come come to America, I won't help you. You'll have to go to school. Why don't you do it now? I said no. First my father, then you...school, school, school. I'm tired of school. So, but I read. He read to me a lot, and when we came in I know what hot means and I know what dog means. I said I understand everything. It's a beautiful country. I have bananas to eat. Everything is...but why do people eat hot dogs?</p><p>(Laughter) Because that's the only thing I could read. And like I said I came here and I start working and I went to school. I finished high school and I start...1 had a small degree in college that is not great, and I I had an art major so | start designing and I designed knitted clothes for a lot of movie people, because we came direct...in New Orleans we were two days.

And we had, we didn't get from the HIAS, <span class="page-break" number="17"></span> 0 02:24</p><p> The poem that you are about to hear was written by Masha Loen, who as a child experienced and survived what is probably the most dramatic and tragic event in the history of mankind - the Holocaust. Of the six million Jews who died or who were put to death by the Nazis, one and a half million were children. This was only forty years ago, within living memory. Yet to many, the Holocaust is a distant and even forgotten episode in history. To those who may have forgotten, it is hoped that in this simple but moving poem, which was written by a child who survived the horror, the world and future generations will remember the unfortunate victims, the survivors and especially those who still have to live with the nightmare, with the sorrow of having lost loved one. Never but never must it be that people become complacent or take the attitude, oh, that was long ago. That has nothing to do with me. But worse still, let by-gones be by-gones. No. Never shall you forget, nor your children, nor your children's children. No. Never must mankind forget what heinous crime a nation committed on fellow men. The question that must be asked is, oh God, why did you let it happen?</p><p> I was a little girl, lost and sad.</p><p> My mother told me I was not bad.</p><p> Then why the agony and pain</p><p> The Nazis inflicted on me with whip and cane.</p><p> The question was unanswered,</p><p> Because mother was no more.</p><p> They took her away to settle the score.</p><p> By hiding her children, she committed a crime.</p><p> And that is why they killed her.</p><p> Oh mother of mine.</p><p> I wasn't a little girl for long any more.</p><p> [had to survive to settle that score.</p><p> The beatings did not hurt.</p><p> Hunger was forgotten,</p><p> Because the one thing in my mind</p><p> Was to take revenge on the lot.</p><p> The time came and I emerged out of hell and pain.</p><p> And the stories I will tell over and over again.</p><p> Now the time has come.</p><p> You are a statistic no more.</p><p> And Memorial is settling the score. <span class="page-break" number="18"></span> 1</p><p> MUSIC</p><p> TECHNICAL CONVERSATION</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: See, the revenge I'm doing is, like I said in the poem, it should never happen again.
