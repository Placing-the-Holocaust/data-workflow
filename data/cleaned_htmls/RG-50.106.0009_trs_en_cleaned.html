And once -- it was very hard because it was -- to this day, I don't sleep.</p><p>The first two weeks was -- was really a horror because we didn't have water. And water is the main thing for survival. And I saw people urinate -- and it was cold, you know, so it froze and they sucked it. I did the same thing, to survive. Then we were quarantined because everybody got the dysentery.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I didn't have shoes, because I lost my shoes in the clay. Because by the time if your foot got into it, you have to twist your foot to pull it out, and your shoe stayed with it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you were barefoot?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, they worked alongside of me. They usually had better jobs, but they always bring me food. Which, I wasn't good of -- I was -- it was degrading me to go and steal or beg for food. I was too young. I was -- so they used to bring me food and take care of me or find a scarf for my head or find a pair of shoes that was too big, but it -- at least they helped.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When you said you cut your hair off if it got too long, how did you do that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I went to the barber. They have a lot of barbers. Well, prisoners, you know, men prisoners. And they had -- well, first of all, it was very dangerous to have hair.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Why was it dangerous?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The lice, one thing. And if you had -- you usually have curly hair, they like that.</p><p>They like when you are pretty. And you couldn't be pretty in camp, you know. They took you out, clean you up, and send you toa home. So you have to be very careful with that.</p></p></dialogue>

What is your feeling, having gone through what you did, what is your feeling about being Jewish?</p><p>A. Well, I'm not ashamed if you want to -- when I lived in Paris, I -- we had Jewish friends and non-Jewish friends, and somebody told me one time, if you have Jewish friends, don't go out with them. Apparently, we didn't -- in France, they don't tell you what religion you are when they meet you or -- it's very -- it's not like in America where you immediately you ask what, how much you make, and how much this and how much.</p><p>Over there it's not like that, and I was a little bit ashamed of saying I was Jewish. I should have told them at that time. I should have slapped him. Now, do it because I feel that they deserve it, but I can't hate either. I can't. I don't like the Germans, and I don't like the people who are assymetrical (ph) of racials, or I don't like them, but I don't want to destroy myself either. Hatred is very difficult.

I never went back to Germany. I will never go back to Germany. That's one thing I promised myself.</p><p>Q. Why not?</p><p>A. To a certain extent, I'm scared that they are going to keep me there. A very normal reaction. And just the language, to hear the language, gives me the -- I'm scared. I get scared. It's, I think, it's a normal feeling.</p><p>Q. Do you receive reparations?</p><p>A. Yes. Not much, because I didn't -- Q. How do you feel about getting them?</p><p>A. To say I deserve it, yes, I guess I do, but if I would have stayed in France, I would have gotten 3 times as much. Doing it from here, it's very little. The worst part is to go to the German counsel every year, and they tell me, sign your name with one N. Like I don't know how my name is spelled, you know.</p><p>Q. What do they mean by that?</p><p>A. Well, two N is German.</p><p>Q. Uh-huh. _ Is there anything else that you wanted to share?

I'm sure that when I go home, I'll remember many other things. And certain things, I don't want to remember. I really don't want to, and I don't want to even talk about it. It's too hard. It's too difficult. It's -- I feel that I don't want to live if I have to live with that, constantly talk about it. It's just too hard. I've lived with my family.</p><p>It's terrible. Maybe I should forget. Maybe I shouldn't remember so much, but we were very close family, and I just can't forget it. It's very difficult. Very difficult.</p><p>Especially, I couldn't talk to him. My husband didn't want to hear about it. You have a different country. You have a different life. Forget it. So I learned to just keep it in myself and having a lot of ulcers. And I never talked about it. It's very difficult.</p><p>The only time I used to talk is when I used to go back to Paris, and all my friends were living. And they all died already. And -- Q. These are friends from childhood?</p><p>A. No, from camp.</p><p>Q. Oh, you mean -- A. Yeah. From childhood, I have -- they're not Jewish, but they're very, very nice. I lived with them. They clothed me. It was very -- and when we talk about that, they knew all my family, and when we talk about it, she cries, like Ido. I just -- but most of the, my family, my father's family, are, like I said, they said to me, um, a French policeman -- I didn't have any money to have a winter coat, and I didn't have a winter coat when I came back, and he got me material.

Any message to your grandchildren?</p><p>A. Well, I hope they grow up to be sensitive young men and to learn what went on, not to be blinded by their parents. That's what I feel. It's very important for the young kids to do that. It's very hard.</p><p>Q. Before we finish, I just wanted to know what your feelings were when you received your number on your arm?</p><p>A. Oh, I felt like I was cattle, you know, stamped. And I ran out -- it was February, and it was muddy, and I took the mud and tried to erase it off, but it didn't come off.</p><p>And I felt very bad. I felt -- well, maybe someday if I come out alive of here out of the camp, I'll have it taken off. And then when I asked my doctor to do that, he said he wouldn't -- he didn't want to do it. He said this should be the diamonds for your grandchildren. And that's true. That's what he told me. Doctor Rosemoth (ph). So I kept iton. Many people took it off, but I kept iton. I don't care anymore. It's part of me, and it's part of what I went through, and it doesn't bother me if people make bad comments or laugh about it. _ It's just, I take it with a grain of salt, and that's it.

From 6 million, that's early. That's very early. And this is Jewish.</p><p>The gentile did not have that. Justthe number. That's it. But I rubbed it very hard in the mud. It didn't come off.
