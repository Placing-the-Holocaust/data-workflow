<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: He was a Dutchman working as a consul, as a British consul. But later on we found out that he was a Nazi.

So, he refused the vis</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A:</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Ubhuh.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And then I went with my grandparents, my grandmother to Hattem and then stayed there.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uhhuh. And you say it took about a month or so until you saw the first Germans?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And do you remember in what capacity you saw them, what they were doing? Were they marching? Was it tanks? Was it</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No. A patrol came by and entered our property and put the rifles in the racks around the fish pond and made themselves comfortable to take a break. And my grandfather went out and yelled at them in German and chased them off.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And they went?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. Well, he spoke fluent German. And, you know, a lieutenant I guess it was the second lieutenant he had been addressed in fluent German by an older man and he packed up and left.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="14"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. I had been in the Lyceum which is the more classical education. And then in Hattem there was a very good school. It was actually a Christian school. But my grandmother decided that a little religion wouldn't hurt us. And that school did in three years what all others did in four. And it also was recognized by the Merchant Marine Academy that I wanted to go to.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Ubhuh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: So,</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So, you went there. Boy, you certainly had the gamut, you know, from a progressive school to a Christian school.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. But the head master was very religious, but we went sailing on Sundays. So, we often met him coming back from church. He came back from church and we were on the way to the boat. So, he gave me a hard time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Because of that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. And did the curriculum change because was it different because of the occupation?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So, there wasn't</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I don't think so.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: There wasn't much influence by the</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, not</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: All right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And then I went to the Merchant Marine Academy up north.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uhbhuh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And there by that time, all students had to sign a declaration that they agreed with the Nazi ideas and principles and would not do anything against it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="15"></span> ontactrefiranneGaushariarg a hither atrmedortabeattfiexaliaton</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: If you didn't sign that, that was the end of your education. So, it was the end of my schooling too.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, you didn't sign it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, no.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was that unusual that people wouldn't sign?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, no. But then you run the risk you have to go in hiding. You had to work for the Germans either in Holland or France or Germany.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, a lot of kids didn't sign and took that risk?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yeah, right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: What did you do when you didn't sign? What did you</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I went back to Hattem, the place where my grandparents lived. But I went to live with another family not too far away and, in a sense, in hiding.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uhhuh. And during the time you were in school, were you involved in any kind of extracurricular activities?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, field hockey.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Field hockey?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Organized, and sailed a lot.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uhhuh. But not politics and not resistance and not going, nothing like that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Didn't like the Nazis, but the Germans</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: When you then went into hiding, how did your life develop? What happened then?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I lived with them but I could not get (inaudible) cars any more. So, the resistance provided those I guess.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And this was in what year? In 1943 or "44?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: 1942.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, in "42?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="16"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So, 1940, "41, "42. And, so, you never did get to the Merchant Marine school?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I never did. Finally I was, but it was very short.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, yeah. So, in 1942 that's still your there's three more years of war left?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What happens to you after that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I got involved in the resistance.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, tell me about it. Tell me how were you brought in? How the same sort of questions. How did you start? Who involved you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: A good friend of mine and I decided he decided that his father was an officer in, say, call it the fellow police and they were mounted. And his father stayed as an officer.</p><p>And then Harry felt that his father was a collaborator and a traitor and we would try to get to England. And he did quite a bit of research. And we went on a hiking trip and got into Belgium and almost to France. There were safe houses, farms where you could stay. You could not camp overnight outside.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Ubhuh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And these safe houses Harry had figured, found out. And that way, we could get through France into Spain and then Portugal and to England. But we lost the trail and we got short of food, so we started going back. And just back in the Dutch, across the Belgium Dutch border we were picked up by a patrol.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: German?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: German patrol, oh, yeah. And they took us actually to a police station and we were interrogated there separately. But we had a good story. We had been on a hiking trip and we were on our way back home.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uhbhuh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So, we spent overnight in separate cells.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uhbhuh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And then they let us go.</p></p></dialogue>

So, if you want to do something, start " we  <span class="page-break" number="17"></span> started actually taking downed airmen we called them pilots but, of course, they were any kind of airmen from one place to another.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Pardon?</p></p></dialogue>

They were brought there</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: by other people. And then we had phony passports and we'd take them to another house. And then we didn't know anymore.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You never knew the people that you met.</p></p></dialogue>

I also knew the guy who was in charge of the whole resistance of the whole are</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I just happened to know the family.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, how long did you do this? How long were you involved in this kind of activity?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Until I was arrested.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And that would have been how long? A year?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was in on December 5, 1944.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Certain dates you don't forget, huh?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Pardon?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: There are certain dates you don't forget?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: That's an easy one, though. December 5th is Sinterklaas in Holland.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. What happened? How were you picked up? How were you arrested?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, I was staying in a house of Mrs. (inaudible). My friend's fiance lived there and his two sisters. He was living somewhere else. And in the morning one morning I was sitting looking at a magazine when German troops, an officer and I think 10 or 12 men came into the yard. And I thought at first I could have run out into the woods through the back door. But then I thought nobody knows you're here, so</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I stayed. And then they arrived at the house and knocked on the door and asked the girls if they would open the door and if there were any men in the house. And she said, "No," of course.</p><p>So, the living room where I was,</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: the corridor is here and the door opened this way. So, I stood in the corner behind the door. And they went through the house. But well, they saw a shaving brush upstairs, of course, and knew. Then the guy in the living room looked under the couch, which was only this high, and they looked through the house and didn't find me. They were outside again talking. And all of a sudden, I heard the guy run back. And he pulled the</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="19"></span>  door open and there I was. So, he poked a rifle in my gut and he yelled, "Da ist er," there he is. So, then I knew that they knew that they were looking for somebody.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So, then he said, "Where's your friend?" I said, "I'm the only one here." They said, "Well, it will be more pleasant if you go with somebody." So, I kept saying I was the only one. They said, "Go upstairs, get your toothbrush, and get on the bike." And I could have escaped many times on the way to their headquarters, but they would go right back and pick up the family there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, they already knew that the two of you were involved, that you and Harry were involved?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not that I was involved, simply that there was a man that lived there, or a boy, a man who was not working for them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Oh, I see. They picked you up because there you were,</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: you're the right age, and you're not working for them in any way.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And that's suspicious?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And then at headquarters they asked me many questions and you saw the ID cards.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Now, Jews had a great big purple J on them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uhhuh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Of course, I'm not Jewish and I didn't have that. But they still thought with the dark hair maybe I could be Jewish. I said, "No." They said, "Drop your pants." Well, I'm not circumcised, so I said, "Okay."</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah. And, so, then that part was at least safe?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="20"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But then they said, "You have to be punished." And but they didn't really know what to do with me. So, they said, "Let's take you to the gestapo in the town across the river." And there the gestapo questioned me again. They never beat me. They never hurt me.</p><p>But my story was good.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uhbhuh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I'm a student up north. I came down here for a vacation. In September the trains stopped running for civilians, so I got stuck here.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That was your story?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And it was so simple and it was partially true.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: So, then they said, "Well, you don't work for us. You have to be punished." There was a hard labor camp, Klein Erik</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A:</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Klein Erika?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: It was called Klein Erik</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: There was also a camp called Erik</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A:</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Uhbhuh.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And it was very bad.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And these were within, within the Netherlands, these camps?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Klein Erika and Erika, the two of them?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Klein Erika was the German name for it, but also in Dutch Small Erik</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A:</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Small Erika and Erika herself?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, you were sent to Klein Erika?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Pardon?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You were sent to Klein Erika camp?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="21"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: What was that like? What did you</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, it wasn't too bad.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: The camp commander had been a professor at the university in (inaudible). And the guy in charge of the work detail had also been a professor. But when the war got bad, they were drafted and put in charge of a hard labor camp. "When one man escapes, shoot two," you know. But</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So, one escapee; two are shot?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. And they had hostages. And the first morning when a new person came in, they selected so many of them to become a hostage.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And then the old hostages were not hostages anymore.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: They were released from being hostages?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But they were still within the camp?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay, okay. So, were you chosen to be a hostage?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, that meant if someone escaped, you were in line?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Irun the risk. So, I looked at my buddies and said, "If one of your guys goes, I will go with you," but nobody ran away.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. So, what how did things progress from there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Pardon?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did things develop from there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, we were marched off every morning to work somewhere, install trenches and gunnery placements or unload barges and do any kind of hard labor.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, this was already towards the end of the war.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="22"></span> </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: When you marched, you had to sing; right?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Pardon? Oh, yeah. When we were marching through the town, we had to sing. And we had about, I think, 25 soldiers, then came the group. Then we came, soldiers on the side. And then behind us again we marched in fives. And behind us again, 25 soldiers.</p><p>And two firemen from Rotterdam had been picked up in a raid. They were still in uniform. They had jumped off a train to Germany and were put in our camp. And they were there, one on the left and one on the right. And then the group leader would go and lead a song. The guy on the left would call the name of the song. And then the guy on the right would call (German phrase) whenever the feet came down and then we all burst out in song.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, good God.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I can't sing. And I was a hostage and I was miserable and I didn't like it. So, I marched along quite grim.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uhbhuh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: One of the guards along the side noticed that I wasn't singing. So, he came in behind me and beat me with a rifle butt and told me to sing. So, I sang off tune and I brought a whole bunch of others out of, out of tune. Another guard heard the discord and finally found out the source and beat me with a rifle butt again and told me to shut up, "Halt mund."</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Halt mund, yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: "Keep your trap shut."</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So, I marched along. And a soldier saw that I wasn't singing, so I got beaten again.</p><p>And then after that, I just mouthed it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You just mouthed the words?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Oh, dear.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I didn't have no more problems, but it took three beatings.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That was a hard lesson.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. What kind of work were you doing once you got to the place you had to go to?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="23"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: We were digging trenches for, along the river</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Uhbhuh.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: at gunnery placements and ammunition bunkers. We also unloaded barges, did all sorts of stuff. Once in a while, we had to unload the barge with carbide. Carbide makes acetylene gas, so it comes in steel drums. Two men could easily lift them and then pick them up and roll them down the gangway</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Uhbhuh.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: to shore. So, we would break it, crack it, and made sure that it ran into the water.</p><p>So, a lot of gas would come out and the Germans would scream and panic.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Sabotage?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. And everybody would be evacuated and sent to wait until the boat stopped.</p><p>So, we got a break that way.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When you were arrested, it was December?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Pardon?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When you were arrested, it was December Sth, "44?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And how long did it take between the time you were arrested and the time you were in this labor camp, Klein Erika? Was it a week?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The evening of the same day.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It was that fast?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did anybody interrogate you about resistance activities?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My story was simple and good.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And, so, they didn't question it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The train stopped running for civilians. I couldn't get back and that's why I'm here.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="24"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When you were in Klein Erika, though, there are two things that come to mind. One, it's wintertime. It's December, January. And, so, conditions probably are not very comfortable. But I want to ask you about that. And, number two, we're already going into 1945 and there's only four months left of the war. Were there battles that were already being fought around the area where you were?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. That was further south. The allies didn't come up September, "44, it was not part of Holland. And, actually, later on in "45 our area was liberated before the western part of Holland.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: My father did mention that they would use their shovels as helmets from the antiaircraft fire.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, tell me about that. You said you used shovels?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: We were digging the trenches</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: from the bridges across the river. One was a railroad bridge. The other one was a traffic bridge. And the allies would come by and try and bomb these. And then the Germans would and also heavy antiaircraft. And when the shells broke, of course the fragments have to come down again. So, we would sit in the trench and have the shovels over our head for the</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So it wouldn't hit you?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did they ever land on one of the people who was a prisoner?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: The guy next to me had one land on his shoulder. He was wearing an overcoat and a jacket. Both had padded shoulders</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Ubhuh.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: but it tore both padding out and it knocked him down.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But he, he had a sore shoulder, but it didn't break the skin. Thanks for reminding me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uhhuh. So, how long did this continue for you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, you've maybe heard about the Battle of Arnhem or A Bridge Too Far." It was a movie. Well, the allies were on the south side of the river. The Germans were digging in</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="25"></span> </p><p> and the allies were shooting them. So, they lost too many troops. So, they decided that they had expendables in camps. So, our camp was one of the camps that provided labor to the area. And that night, it was my turn and there was always confusion. The gates were open. It was a blackout, quite dark. Two guards came marching towards each other and presented arms, about face, and marched back. And they did it and I watched them for a while. And, like I say, it was very black out. And the trucks were there ready to drive off. The gates were open. And I went up there and walked out.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You just simply walked out?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. I had nothing to lose. Not too far away was the house of a friend of mine.</p><p>Now, he and his father were in hiding somewhere. But I knocked on the door and I borrowed a bicycle there and went back to my apartment the other side of the river.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: A bicycle with rubber? With wheels?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Pardon?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The bicycle had wheels?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It had even tires.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It had tires?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But she never saw the bike again.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, you went back to this was your grandparents" place?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, but I didn't go to her house.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Your grandmother's house?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I went to the house where I had been arrested, where I'd been in hiding.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see. And what why did you go back there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, my grandmother's house was right in between two estates that the Germans occupied. Actually, my grandmother's garage had a cannon in it. The Germans had put it there.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I didn't think that the camp would really know who had brought me there. So,</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And where else could I go?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And, so, what did you do then? After that, you returned to this house. Did you go back into hiding?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So, our group went near the bridge across the canal. The river was further to the east.</p><p>And the Canadians were coming up on that side. So, we were supposed to hold the bridge in case they came, the Canadians came across. They never did. And then one day the Germans came and they wanted our house. So, we could not go there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uhbhuh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And that night the Germans ambushed the guys that were at the bridge and they were wiped out.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, this was part of your resistance?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And the farmer and his wife were hung in the door of the barn.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Who was hung in the door of the barn?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: There was a farm, and the farmer and his wife were strung up in the door of the barn.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Then later on we were asked a German General Blaskowitz had been in the southern part of Holland or not the southern, central part of Holland. And he had been harassed there. Then he was in Hilversum where the allies had their headquarters. And he had come to our area and we were asked to harass him. And, so, we went and cut his wires, telephone wires across there was a small road into the woods with three rows of birches on each side. It was somekind of a fire break. But there were two paths you could walk through more or less.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Ubhuh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: There were several houses, summer homes that now the Germans occupied. The telephone wires strung through, across the road through the trees.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Ubhuh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And we were asked to cut the wires.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They said that I was the most technical, so it was my job. But we had to pull down the wires and cut out about six feet so they couldn't just splice them back. And we did.</p><p>And then we cut several wires. Then somehow the Germans started blowing whistles and they all barged out and started shooting at each other and we backed out through the woods. I had a whole bunch of wires wrapped around my waist.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, the guilty guy.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, the Canadians were on the east side of the River IJssel and the resistance decided to like I said, there were two estates with ammunition in them and a small group of Germans. But then they decided that we could take over.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Ubhuh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: So, we went to talk with the officer of the Germans and he said he would not surrender to terrorists, only to an allied officer, equal or superior rank. But he also said that we could blow him up so he would not do anything anymore. And we put a guard</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Ubhuh.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: next to the place for there was a chance that people in the town would come up and harass them.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And then we waited until the Canadians came close, and we got one officer to come over and they surrendered.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: To that officer?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
