<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My name is Helene Barac, Helene D. Barac. I was born in Belgium in 1933 in April. I was born in Brussels. I know that my patents at the time lived in a town of Namure (ph) that's it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Your parents were from Belgium?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, my parents were both Russians. My mother and father were both born in Madava (ph), which at that time was Disrabia (ph), and came to Brussels, I guess in about 1928. So actually on their way to South America. My father had a Ph.D in chemical engineering and was a paper expert. And they stopped, had dinner at somebody's house, who had invited a man who is in charge of the paper mills in Belgium, they were naturalized. And, this man and my dad got along very well. He offered my dad a job and asked my mom how she liked the country, and she said she loved it, and there we were.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What do you remember of your life in Belgium before the war?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Normalcy, a great deal of normalcy. We lived -- it was very old fashioned but the people who worked at my dad's factory were separated between the workers and the -- what do you call them -- the managers. And they all lived in complexes, and where we lived which is where the managers would live, was the street with a mountain behind it and a squate, not too far away. And I was not allowed to go play on the square. And on Sundays we would climb up the mountain. And other than that, I was allowed to talk to people on my street and play with their dogs. None of them had children. I went to bed at the same time every day. I got up at the same time every day. I was fed basically the same food every day. Very, very normal untramatic life.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you have any brothers or sisters?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No brothers, no sisters. I had a lot of cousins who I saw quite a bit.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What about school?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh, I don't remember much about school except that I loved my teachers.</p><p> oO: Was it a public school or a ? <span class="page-break" number="0"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And did that cause any confusion?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. My parents were both and I was brought up with no consciousness of being Jewish at all. One of my sets of cousins was terribly terribly Catholic. And, I remember thinking it's kind of a silly waste of time to have to spend so much time praying and going to church and all that, because it's their business. And my other cousins who weren't Jewish were really not practicing Jews in the same way that we were.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was there any conscious -- political consciousness about 2</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> "As No, my parents were both -- I guess they both felt -- especially my dad, that they belong to the Russian Italian Embessy. I guess that my mother didn't. My mother was really very high politicalized person, but she was much broader, my father was not. And my father belonged to that category of Jews who had aligned themselves with the Russian Communist Party to a great extent. And really thought of themselves as Russians not as Jews. And felt that they had been totally accepted in the world of Russians on . That is what he felt. And <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> was teading a French book and that got us into a conversation which finally ended up by telling her where I was from and she said "Oh my goodness, she was from there. When did I live there?" Very suspiciously she asked me this and I told her and she looked at me and she said "Oh, were you the Belgiums or the Jews?" So which really brought home to me the fact that I wasn't the only one that considered myself not a part of this Jewish community.</p><p>Because there were many -- I don't know, there were quite a few maybe 20, 30, Jewish people who were living there, you know, under village arrest.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You wete aware that you were Jews but you weren't aware of the double risk?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Absolutely not. I didn't realize that anybody was at a double risk. And I was a small child and quite innocent. My knowledge of war came from literature. And in literature there is no such thing as this. At least not the literature that you read when you ate six or seven years old.</p><p>There ate good guys and there are bad guys, and that is basically it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Let's go back to Belgium. I want you to tell me a little about what you were, your family knew about Hitler or Naziism (ph) before Belgium ?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I knew nothing. My father, I really don't know. My father obviously knew everything that my mother did because she would have shared it with him. My mother was a clinical scientist and she said that when I was born, she cried and cried and cried and cried because it was 1933 and she could see what was coming. So she was very aware. And I know that when I was a child there had been many many conversations about immigrating. And my father kept saying no, we will be okay and my mother kept saying, no we got to go. At one point they -- my mother and I, went to Romania (ph) where my maternal grandparents were living and we went to where my maternal grandmother was living. You see my maternal grandparents and my maternal grandmother were living and to try to get them out. At one point my maternal grandparents did leave Romania (ph) and they went to visit their son who at this time, that's the man who had gone to live on _____ at one point. And he was now living in Argentina with his wife and two children. I guess maybe that he didn't even have two children at that time. Yeah, but anyway they went to visit him and they decided they really wanted to go home, they didn't feel comfortable. They felt that maybe they were too old to take on this culture. My mother and father argued with them that a Spanish culture was something very foreign to them. French or Belgium culture would be something they would be much more familiar with, at least through their education, etcetera etcetera and tried to convince them to stay in Belgium. They declined this as well and went on back. And then in 1937 my mother and I went to Romania (ph) and Russia, and tried to get my grandparents to leave, to no avail. So that is how much my patents knew, a great deal, a great great deal.</p><p> oO: What do vou remember about this when it happened. how things started changino? <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> that they were passing out flowers in a corner and we should take these flowers and take the petals off of them and put them in baskets. Because, the next day our armys would come on through on their way to fight the Germans. And so we did this to the flowers and a great deal of hooplah and horay horay, we ate going to be saved. The next day we were excused from school. And, my parents house was on a main toad which was a two-lane highway but was still a main road. And, the troops came marching down the main road where everybody who lived anywhere near was out on the streets. And people had bread and they had cheese and they had wine and lots and lots and lots of wine which they gave to the soldiers wishing them well and wishing them luck and children would throw petals on the soldiers marching by. It was very glorious and very very glorious and three days later they came back or four days later or something, you know. The wat was won, the Germans had walked all over them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How was the mood?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, they went from total elation to total defeat, I mean not good. There is a very very powerful poem written bv -- I believe it is . It just basicallv sets the tone for this <span class="page-break" number="3"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Sure.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So even the short time and we are talking a few weeks --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, we are talking -- yeah maybe two.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were your activities restricted?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was there any sense --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No that is what I was going to tell you. Yes, things changed terribly from the day of the petal throwing to the day that we left which was somewhere between seven and ten days later. I mean we ate talking about a very short period of time. What happened is that the routine my life had followed until that day became nonexistent. Nobody seemed to care whether I was fed or not. I had a maid, my parents had a maid who was usually about 17 years old or so that took care of me. So she was mote ot less like a mother's helper more than anything else.</p><p>Anvwav. this voune cirl had cotten quite sick with and she had sone to live with her <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> certain amount of are successful and people are just down dead. So it is just an unbelievable sight you know. And this went on for a long time, it went on for about two days, I guess.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Who wete all these people 2</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: People, people. Belgium citizens, .</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Where were they going?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They were going away from trouble. They were being bombed, I think. And you know the Germans had occupied Belgium.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Where were they going ?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: To the South, there was no other way to go because on the one side was the ocean and on the other side was Germany. So they all had to go to France.</p><p> oO: Would vou find this ot somewhat an adventure this ? <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> which of course, was occupied at the time. But my Argentineans (ph) uncles sister in law lived in Paris so we went and lived with her. We went and stayed there maybe about a month and a half and it was very, very strange because people were wearing gas masks and all I remember Paris is playing on the , which was . And the gas masks that people were wearing were very strange. It was kind of a unpleasant time. So after Paris, we went to this --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How long ago?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: About a month and a half. Until after Paris then my parents decided that we ought to go to the South of France. And I guess this must have been in July or the end of June or July. In putting it all into perspective I thought that we got to _____ in June because everybody went to in June but, I think maybe it was in July. When I say everybody I really mean everybody. The whole country was heading for . It was the big free city it was still the third or fourth largest city in France at the time. It was free, all the great movie stars were there. All the great singers the popular singers were there. Everybody who was anybody who had any rights to anything was there. And the whole population besides that was there and all the refugees were there. The city was bursting, there was no room anywhere. When we got to Y=</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did you get there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: How did we get there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It's difficult. My mother was pretty much the brains behind our organization of that particular trip and she said that we had to leave, so we went on to the southwest. And we got to and along with a great, great many people, we tried to cross the river a couple of bridges and we got to one of the bridges was already overfilled with people and the Germans were still , they were bombing badly. And we barely did not make it to the bridge. But then we finally did. And we pushed and we shoved and we pushed and we shoved and we moved to the other side of the bridge. And we pushed and we shoved and we oot off the bridge and the bridge went into the river. So I cuess that was a vetv <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> and then the train was stopped and everybody had to get off but we didn't have a bicycle. So we never made it to Rome. Though, we were to Central France then we went on to LaRuse (ph).</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: re</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. We got to LaRuse (ph) which is, as I say, was a total mad house. And you know how French towns ate with the squares in the middle, every tree on that square was filled with notes. You know family so and so looking for so and so and looking for so on. But in 19-- maybe it was 1983, "82, something like that, I was stuck at the airport in Miami because of a huge snow that developed in the North, that was getting back to New York City. And I was stuck there like for a day and a half, and turned out I was sitting next to a French family there talking away in French. And my father and I had just gone through a part of his history and I was writing it down. And he had just told me about his episode in LaRuse(ph). You know how everybody was blah, blah, blah. So these French people were there and I asked if they were about my age or a little bit older. Actually maybe ten years older than I was. And they were at about the right age to remember everything. And I said to one of them after we made friends, and where were you in June of 1940? He said "Madam, I was in LaRuse (ph) like everybody else." And he described to me the scene exactly as I have described to you. So that's -- I found that very interesting, indeed.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When you were traveling, did you have food?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> Ag Where did we stay? We always stayed with somebody, somebody always put us up. I mean we were -- I think by this time France has sort of polarized itself, you know, pretty much.</p><p>The poor Germans and the Germans and the for the most part were <span class="page-break" number="7"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: On the tree?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And so had they. People find each other like that, you know. It's the same way they found themselves after the war was over in all countries. They put up notes and advertised in newspapers. People just combed those lists, you know, and if you knew somebody that was looking for somebody, you found the name and you pass it on. When people are determined, it's not very hard. All you have to do is just comb the lists. So anyway, we stayed with a very nice family in LaRuse (ph) the man had been _____ I guess he had a place that done weddings and receptions and what not, so there were grounds -- very nice grounds.</p><p>And little gazebos and a very, very lovely large restaurant and barns and what have. And most of his family was there and some of his friends were there and we were there. And after that I have no idea why we were there. But I know that my parents and he just got alongs just famously and he had a nephew who was 15 who's mv life and other than <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> 0 changed back and forth from 1914 to 1940 between Russia and Romania. And in 1940, I was given over to Romania. Romania was part of the axis, so therefore I thought it was part of his military service under an allied country or an unallied country. Which caused a great deal of problems to the Germans who were very, very rule bound as we all know. And, he didn't know what to do with us. So they simply put us under house arrest and they sent out for more instructions. This was -- I skipped over one town that we were in all together. That is the town where I lived -- the woman I told you about earlier. Anyway, we are in a little town called which was outside LaRuse (ph) and that is where the Germans had problems with my identification, my parents had classification and they put us under house arrest. And we would leave at night and we would go stay in the yard, mostly in barns and then we would come back in the morning. Anyway, one night my parents had organized a group of maybe about 17 people or so -- all Jews, and with children unfortunately. We left one night to cross the to get into Spain and because the shepherds in the hills were very, very friendly. They kind of considered everybody to be part of . And which we certainly weren't. These three salted the milk. They salted the milk so it wouldn't go sour and they welcomed people to use their huts. Well they weren't really huts they were more like stone</p><p> . I mean great big stones. We arrived in one of those and settled in and children cried and screamed because of the salt in the milk and they were hungry and tired. So my father put it in cold water down stream but he didn't -- the Germans running an expedition found the milk and us and brought us back to the village. Of the 17 people that were there, 14 of them were sent immediately to a concentration camp.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: ?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> "As Well , I don't know, they were just sent. And they didn't know what to do with us. So the next time --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How come you didn't go with the other 14?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because they didn't know what to do with my father's papers. My father had done his military service for the route. So he now has the right and they didn't know what to do with us. So if he had been German and had done his military service, there would be no problem that was covered. So, it is nice not to be covered. So anyway, we were put under strict house arrest except me, I still had the freedom to go around the village. I still don't know why I did that. It was a very small village, I don't think there was a 150 people in that town, that village.</p><p>We left again, this time we left the two grown men, two brothers and we crossed the mountains and arrived in . I was kind of terrified that we were caught by soldiers on the way up but they were French soldiers so they let us go. I think my father gave them some gold. We also had a guide, my father said that he knew the guy that was going to kill us or try to kill us because that is what a lot of the ouides did. Thev killed the people for <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> 1 after a while and disappeared, he just ran off. So then there was just the five of us.</p><p>O: ? <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> 2</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: ?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> Ag No, not at this level of jail. And of this level of jail, of course, we were sorted and put into other jails. The women went off to the women's jails and the men went off to the men's jails.</p><p>Now the men's jails was just more of the same. It had political prisoners, it had political prisoners that were left over from the Spanish Civil War. It had criminals, it had big time criminals, it had small time political prisoners. And those jails was the men's jail which was the main jail in Barcelona (ph) which also was filled to capacity. Anyway, I am trying to remember exactly what -- I went to the jail a number of times so I'm trying to remember what it looked like. It had three sides with a bench of a stone bench built inside to the side of the cell and the door or whatever and I think that in my father's cell there was nine men with a place for three men to sleep. So they took turns, you know. And my dad tells me that one of the men who was a political -- I'm sorry who was a political man, a wonderful, wonderful story teller. And I know that one of the other men was a political prisoner who -- a Jew, a French Jew who joined the French underground. He's a psychiatrist who been caught and sent to which was the terrible concentration camp in Spain. And he had been <span class="page-break" number="11"></span> 3 End of Tape #1 <span class="page-break" number="11"></span> 4 Tape #2</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Okay. Well I am going to go back in time now and tell you about my life in France. Because that will give you a sense on how people did live. The first town that I lived in that I can remember very well was Paris. Paris as I remember was a fearful place, not a pleasant place.</p><p>A very -- maybe science fiction type of place because of the gas masks. And they are really fixed in my memory. And I don't know if they really looked that way or not but as I see them, they had these two thinks plopped over your eyes. And then this nozzle which came out and I think, plopped over your mouth. So it really looked like an anthestetic-type contraption, you know. As I said, I don't remember if it's true or not, maybe that is just what I see in my mind's eye. But, I didn't have any friends there where I used to play on the Chamuse (ph) and under the Eiffel tower. And I just don't remember anything except life was not pleasant. Life was definitely not pleasant. We had the run of the town, there was no food to be had. The Germans were there and there were lines everywhere. There were coupons for goods but even with coupons you couldn't really get anything, so that takes care of Paris.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was the German presence like?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't remember, I don't remember anything except what I've told you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q:</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: There were curfews and there were blackouts and yeah, the curfews were very long. I guess they were from six to seven or eight or something like that. So all night long -- a lot of sirens, a lot of sirens and a fair number of fires.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you stick with your parents most of the time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Ah-huh. Sure, sure. You know if I had any brothers or sisters, I don't know if we would have made it or not. It was so much easier because they shuffled me around ftom one parent to the other one and they were both parents together. And so I always had somebody protecting me. And they only had one person to take care of. But with brothers and sisters, I don't know if we would have been able to manage it. Because I have four children myself and I think about how difficult it was to travel or to go anywhere with them when they were small. And I just don't know how they could have done it. Anyway, the next town that I remember -- well, you asked me at one point how people helped us and how we lived in terms of food and everything. I remember that we went to another small town where we lived for maybe two months or so. I don't even remember the name of the town -- if it would come to me. was the name of the town. Just and the rivet is <span class="page-break" number="12"></span> 5</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What happened to those relatives?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> Ag Ah, those relatives. Those relatives most ingeniously, I don't remember. I call one of them, his name is . I call him my uncle, he's not of course. He is my father's second cousin who married my fathers first cousin, who was his second cousin. And who presently lives in New York and I call him my uncle. It has always been much easier. Most ingeniously, he said to me one day, oh Helene I knew it you know. I said to your dad, we have money, we will get out of it somehow. You have no money, but you have brains you'll get out of it somehow. So they did, from Laruse (ph) they vanished with their money to and then from to Cuba. And they spent the rest of the war in Cuba with families. I think the other family stayed in Cuba throughout the war and eventually went to Mexico. That families business has been tan, tanning furs, or tannery. And all business had been fur brokering and after the war and his family went back to New York, which is where I ended up. But that is the end of this story.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So back to ?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> At Back to to where we staved for about two months. We remember the <span class="page-break" number="13"></span> 6 months and I remember this was the first time when I really remember my dad taking me out for walks and becoming the great philosopher, you know. We saw a field of daffodils one time; words could not have been any prettier. It was in an oak field tons and tons and tons and tons of oak and mistletoe growing from the oaks. And just tons and tons and tons and tons of daffodils. Oh gosh, this must have been 1941 right, because of the springtime.</p><p>And it was so beautiful, I remember my father telling me that marriage was a terrible institution. And he was very, very lucky because he had found himself a very nice wife who had not conned things out of him. Not just the fact that she was his wife but, the only way to live is for two people who adored each other to live with each other, without the unsacred</p><p> of marriage and on and on and on. In his very procommunist fashion we went on and started talking to me about politics. About how the communist regime was the only thing that made any sense, you know and blah, blah, blah. And I remember being very struck bv how much sense this made daffodils. So then -- those are the sort of memories <span class="page-break" number="14"></span> 7 had moved to the South of France warmed there way, but still didn't speak French -- we did.</p><p>We were accepted by everybody, everywhere that we went as being French speakers. I told you about that woman that I met who asked me, was I for Jews or Belgians. We were for Belgians, we were one of them. And so it was very different and I could go to school and make friends with my teachers and make friends with my school mates. We read the books and we get benefits of going to school. So my life was normal and then just totally disrupted.</p><p>Was totally different, but at least there was a base, a connection in my life. I never felt unconnected.</p><p> oO: vou talk about beine a concentration camp. I'm trvine to understand about <span class="page-break" number="15"></span> 8 I remember where we lived and how it was. We lived in a house that belonged to the priest and I guess he had rented it. I don't know if he rented it to us or the Germans or whatever it was. But you seen pictures of Welch Villages where the street is like this and then the -- kind of a side street like this, with a wall and then the house is behind the wall and there's this walkine place. then we lived in one of those. And next door to us. there lived an old <span class="page-break" number="15"></span> 9</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Um-hum. I remember my school teacher, I remember the school was divided into two parts, the boy's side and the girl's side and usually in schools then -- country schools like that the husband and wife would teach school. And I remember going -- when I went back to see them, I was 20 years old. I'd teach at this school and one of the teachers said "Ah, that's little Helene, who wasn't always very good." You know, I remember reading novels for the first time. I remember I was very young reading a Mid Summer's Night Dream. Which, I thought wonderful. But then I remember reading a story which really was not a child's story. And I remember the plot of it perfectly well. So then when I read it as an adult I said goodness, I really did remember that story, you know. What did we have to eat, I remember on my birthday in 1941 when I gathered about 25 kids that was -- I think is what the village had. And I brought them all to my house for my birthday. And my mother produced a couple of onions, which is all she had. But, it was okay. I mean I was very disappointed, I mean very, very disappointed, but it was okay we got the onions, you know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When you talk about this time in the concentration camp, it doesn't sound much like a concentration camp?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's what I keep --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Sounds like you had a nice little life.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's what I keep telling you it wasn't a concentration camp, we were under village arrest.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You had to live in this village until --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We could not move out of it. Okay. Now eventually we left and we tried to escape but when we came back we were put under house arrest. And that was very very bad. When we were in village arrest my father went out and -- you see my father was brough up on a farm when he was a child and he's very clever with things and he knows how to make things grow and to ___ with machinery and make it do whatever he wants it to do. He's just one of these people that just seems to have a way with everything. And so he became friends with some of the farmers and he would work for them, of course it was for free. But it was never for free they would give him a pregnant rabbit, a duck with some eggs. Though we always had things, and food and at one point we had these neighbors who lived -- I guess that is when we lived in</p><p> . We had these neighbors who were very Jewish, I mean the man was a chauffer, they were very religious and they had a grandmother who really couldn't ___. So my father decided to build her a little privy (ph) which she put in the little shed in the back, which she had to share with two goblins. Turkey goblins, which my father had gotten. Again from some farmers which and we had votten a who we called Hecter (ph). I cuess we called <span class="page-break" number="16"></span> 0 people would get up on the table and let go and sing. You know, and there was a lot of wine flowing. There wasn't food, because we didn't have food because the Germans took much of that. But we did manage to secrete enough of the pig, you know. And then once in a while we'd kill a goose or something and render its fat and put the goose into the fat, you know.</p><p>And you would have meat to eat along with the goose fat. You could spread on whatever, potatoes or whatever vegetable that you had. So that is how we lived, we went to school and I played with the kids and I'd play with them after school and my parents talked to me and I read a lot of books and it was very disruptive, but I don't remember the bad things, I just refuse to remember the bad things. But I do that as a adult. I have a very very hard time remembering bad things.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And wherever you went, it seems the people that lived in these villages were all very well</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> ?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Pretty much so, to us anyway. And , the mayor and his wife told my parents that they wanted to adopt me if anything bad would happen to my parents, they were going to pass me off as their child. And everyone in the village said that it was okay. They would ask me and since I spoke French, the Germans wouldn't know. And they gave me some sort of Catholic instruction so I could deal with that a little more easily. I still didn't know that I was Jewish, I just did know that I wasn't Catholic. Or a practicing Catholic. Because to me, there were only two religions. Either you were a practicing Catholic or you weren't. And you know, that was so common in Belgium and France at that time. Nobody was Protestant, nobody was Jewish, nobody was Moslem. You were Catholic and you practiced or you didn't.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did the adults, at this point have much information about what was happening in Eastern Europe that you were aware of?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> Pats No, at that time, I didn't know. My parents told me in 1942 is when they started becoming aware of what happened. I think that was true everywhere, wasn't it? Pretty much.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Through the radio or through other organizations?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We weren't in contact with any organization, only the free French. And they weren't really interested in anything that wasn't military.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I also understand maybe that your parents had no connection with this but Southern France. there were efforts to set people over to Switzerland and Spain? <span class="page-break" number="17"></span> 1</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I have absolutely no idea. Thinking about it, I would think that my parents would have thought that that was one step closer to the United States and it might have been easier to deal with the mountains that were already half way on than to have to start from the bottom and cross over. More difficult mountains.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But your dad wasn't involved in any organization -- you know crime -- communist organizations or any political organizations?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He was involved with the political resistance in a very, very small way, when we were living in . Somebodv asked him and mv mother if he could help bringing food out to the <span class="page-break" number="18"></span> 2 fourth time that I was really scared. I mean that was total terror. Total, total terror. Because I knew that was instant death. And-- but they didn't find us and we headed back to our house and I guess what had happened is that they came to our house and found that we weren't there and so we were to be deported the next dav. and we left. And that is when we <span class="page-break" number="18"></span> 3</p><p> Pats Yes. That is because we were dealing with this family called the Hartoff (ph) and my mother wanted to send messages to my dad and so they had gotten a piece of chocolate somehow. A nice little piece of chocolate with a wrap around it maybe this big and it looked very small to me and it was small and the only thing that looked chocolate was this enormous and very tempting to me and I remember my parents would put little messages inside the wrapper and I would take the messages from one to the other back and fourth. Oh I remember how they got that piece of chocolate; my father said that he sold his wedding ring to get it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now this is a different family than the German family?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No this is the family --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: This is the family's house that you tried to burn down?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> Pats Um-hum.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How long did you live with them?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: At least three months maybe more. At least until my mother got out of jail, about three months -- it was three to six months.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The ___ was before this?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> At No after when mv mother got out of jail and mv father was sent to the . <span class="page-break" number="19"></span> 4 feelings about leaving your parents to go to Portugal?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Close to my parents. But, I wasn't -- I hated my parents in a good healthy child-like way. I trusted them ___. I guess pretty normal feelings towards them and hated them bitterly because they put all these restrictions. I trusted them ____ because I knew that they would always take care of me. I was pretty adventurous. I think that at that time I had learned like I really liked to live on the edge. I thought that was the only way to live and I came to realize much later in my life how other people have always lives is because I learned during that time that was the only way to live. As far as I was concerned there was no other way. There was no safety in anything and so that was the norm. And so I left my parents to go to Portugal an extension of the norm. If bad things had happened to me and to rescue me in some wav. You know what I'm trvine to sav or is that too foreion? <span class="page-break" number="20"></span> 5</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Ah, did I make friends? Yeah, the way you make friends in a boarding school. You make friends with a lot of people but you didn't make close friends because there wasn't enough time. We were put in this convent where we all had one thing that we wanted to do and that was to make the nuns totally miserable for no reason but to amuse ourselves. Find toads and put them in their beds and tear up sheets and do bad things for the sake of doing bad things.</p><p>Tell awful stories about those nuns, just awful stories. I don't remember any of them but I remember that was the order of the day.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you think maybe that was an expression of some control?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> "As It's hard to tell at that age, you know. I mean that is what you read in all the 19th century novels of kids of that age doing probably -- but I don't think that the war was related or more experience related --but more age related. Eventually we got on a ship.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now were these European Quakers or American Quakers?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I didn't meet any of them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So who was in charge of you -- organizing this -- who were the people?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Damned if I know. You see I have no recollection of any supervisory other than the nuns.</p><p>Eventually we got put on the boat and as far as I'm concerned nobody was in charge of us.</p><p>All I remember is that the sailors thought that he was very amusing to have us and the sailors told me they were going to teach me proper American manners. Teach me how to say thank you to everybody and you know. So a European little girl sat down and curtsied everywhere I went. So I bowed and curtsied and then they taught me to say "fuck you" which was the first thing that I said to my aunt when I came to the United States. And I said that and I had no idea what I was saying to them. The innocence and they didn't speak English so, tell me that that boat was filled with bread baskets. But as soon as the bread was put out, it was eaten up. I remember and I don't know how this happened these two men to which we had crust were on my boat. And I remember we went by authorities and kids came up to the boat and the people came up to the boat and the people came up to the boats from little ships and climbed up the boat. And came with pineapples I never had eaten one and those two men had enough money to buy me sugarcane and pineapple which was the first time that I tasted either one of them. And I don't remember what they were doing on that boat with it. If it was in their way or if there wasn't enough room but I know that they were on that boat.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember how long the trip was?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I don't. I remember that we arrived as far as I remember we arrived in Pennsylvania. So I guess it must have been -- I don't remember -- what's that city in Pennsylvania -- there is a port and I think we got to Pennsylvania and then we were put on a train and the train brought us to a school. So it must have been June. Must have been summer because school <span class="page-break" number="21"></span> 6 was out and up in New York State around Mt. Pleasant, just north of New York City.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In 1943?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: June or July or August. You know it was summer time because school was out and it put us there and they set us up style to play outside on the playground. I remember seeing things that I never seen before. The slides that they had in those days. Just the two bars with no nothing between the two bars, you don't remember those slides?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, just two bars and nothing in between. You know and you just went down the bars, they're fun and swing sets and things like that. My parents put down the address of there only known relative who is a cousin of my fathers who lived in Pittsburg. And sewn it in my coat pocket on my coat lining. And he was contacted and he said he would have me. But he really didn't think that he should. Anyway, should just have me come to the United States.</p><p>That is exactly what happened . Andre was contacted at the same time that he was combing these lists and I just arrived and he had called my cousin -- my mother's cousin to let me know where he was. So anyway, it was arranged that I should go and live with them. And it was a good arrangement because these were people that really knew me. And he was with my dad when I was born and he known me as soon as my dad had seen me. But you know, people thought of as our very closest relatives there daughter was -- ah, I don't know eight years old, my big sister so they took me over.</p><p> oO: You don't have anv more memories of what that felt like _ what vou did -- did vou plav <span class="page-break" number="22"></span> 7 Conclusion of Interview <span class="page-break" number="22"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
