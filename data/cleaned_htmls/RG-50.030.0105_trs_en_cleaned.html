<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And what was your maiden name?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My maiden name was Weissmann so I still carry it as Gerda Weissmann Klein.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Where and when were you born?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was born on May 8th, 1924 in the most southern western part of Poland in a town called Beilitz in German and Bielsko in Polish. It went by both names and it was in the province of Salasia (ph) at the foothill of the mountain range. <span class="page-break" number="0"></span> place called Krinitza (ph). Uh I even remember my my very first uh incident which inspired a great deal of fear. My mother and I went to a concert and I remember the setting quite vividly. Uh there were flowers around. I'm not very musical but uh that summer something caught on that day and I remember uh the crowd of people sitting there and and flowers and it was very warm, uh a day of...you know, one of the golden days of of summer, as I see it now, and suddenly a young man came running up to the podium and he pushed the conductor aside and he said, how can you all sit here listening to music when danger is coming from there, and he pointed to to the ___ which separated us from Czechoslovakia which already had been occupied by the Nazis and and he said monsters are coming from there. Why don't you go home and take up arms and join...I remember moving closer to my mother and and saying shouldn't we go home and uh but pretty soon police came and uh arrested the man because he was an agitator for disturbing the peace. I I I still remember that that sudden fear. That that really was my my first memory of uh of something impending but we stayed perhaps another week. I don't remember exactly how long. However, on our way home we saw at stations an awful lot of baggage which was labeled Warsaw. Apparently people were going to Warsaw and when we came home uh my father had his arm in a sling and my mother naturally was terribly concerned and uh apparently he had suffered a slight heart attack and uh unfortunately and since things were moving very fast, uh that must have been perhaps the third week in August...that we received a telegram from my uncle in Turkey. My mother had a brother...my mother only had one brother and he lived in Turkey and uh he sent us a telegram saying that we should get out, that we had visas which were in the Embassy in Warsaw, but my mother said uh we're not going to tell Poppa about the telegram. Poppa is ill (ph) and he should not be disturbed. And I guess that my family, and I only <span class="page-break" number="0"></span> know, when Poppa decreed something, he would do anything and that he should suddenly ask us, particularly my brother, to make a decision...such a momentous decision. I remember it was a terrible shock and uh it was very turbulent night and when it ceased in the morning and my father said to me that I I should go and apparently he wanted to talk to my mother and my brother that I should not be around and he said that I should call the family to see what everyone is doing, my father's brothers and there were uncles and aunts and so on, and I went downstairs and uh the ring of the telephone...there was no answer. No one answered anywhere and uh you know, I remember suddenly it was like like you were left in a world of the dead, you know, all those homes that I remembered and the phones were ringing and ringing and there was no answer whatsoever and uh when I came up my father said no one answers today, and I said no.</p><p>And it was a wonderful Saturday. Everything was cut off. There was...we had no electricity, no light and it was a beautiful, calm September day, flowers outside and my parents were sort of joking. My father got dressed and came downstairs and we were all sitting together and it was really the the last beautiful day. And then in the evening they start with some shelling and my brother went out to let his dog in and when he came back he he had a hole in his trousers and he said they were shooting from the rooftops. The Germans were coming but we went to the basement with some other people, you know, and it was morning. Then I I don't remember those hours too well, but what I remember most vividly is uh that my mother called, said we should come. She had prepared some breakfast and we came upstairs and we sat down. Suddenly, this tremendous roar, the roar of motorcycles and it was the motorcycle with Nazis in it, two...one in the side car and on sitting up there, and my brother had just, he had a wristwatch, but he had just taken it out of his pocket because he carried it in his pocket, and I saw his, you know, his hand was down and it was 9:10 in the morning. And I remember everybody just sat there totally stunned and then we heard people uh running. There were more more cars and more motorcycles were coming and and people were shouting, heil Hitler, and we saw from from the house across the street the black swastika flag and I think that was the most enormous shock, that people were prepared, was our neighbors, you know, our friends, and they knew it in the very first hour and uh to me, and of course, you know, you can only see it in in retrospect and of course I lived it many times, but one of the things uh it sort of changed suddenly. I remember uh the coal fell out from the cradle of the fireplace and uh it went on the carpet and the carpet was sort of smoldering and and no one paid any attention to it and I remember it had once happened before...how upset my mother was and no one paid any attention. These were just tiny little vignettes which suddenly sort of you know changed everything. And uh shortly thereafter perhaps...you know, then more and more trucks of soldiers were coming and and the voices grew more hoarse, people shouting heil Hitler and I I saw a childhood friend of mine carrying white roses to to the soldiers and somebody was giving the soldiers schnapps and flowers for</p><p> and the whole sort of thing and I I remember starting to cry and my brother <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> things happened that afternoon. Uh the mother of the childhood friend of mine...she blessedly is alive and she lives in Israel...her name is Esther Bergman (ph). Her mother came and she asked where my father was and she said uh...but she knew that he was ill but she said,also to my brother that no man should go on the streets because they had rounded up all the men that they could find and they locked them in the temple and they set the temple aflame and then she sort of went out by the back door. And I think that was truly the first impact what happened.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What happened over the next few days? How did uh things 2 <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> change?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: What I can unfortunately tell you...uh fairly soon an order came that all young men between I think sixteen and fifty had to register. My father at that point was about fifty and since he was ill he did not have to register for a transport. My brother was nineteen and, of course, everyday you know, that we knew that England and France declared war, you know, that we knew right away. That happened Sunday. You know, we were occupied Sunday morning. Sunday afternoon uh England and and France declared war on Germany. Uh then you know, most of the family had fled, our family; however, my father's sister who had uh been separated from her husband and daughter in one of the trains which which were bombed, came back with her son David and she found her apartment occupied by uh by other people, and she came to stay with us. David was about my brother's age, and David and also my brother went to register to whatever they were going to do and they said that they they would be in uh in some sort of labor battalion to uh build up what was uh destroyed by the war. The date was the 19th of October on which my brother left. Anyway...I tell you one thing...my my mother refused to make his bed for for months. She wanted to keep the imprint of his head on the pillow.</p><p>(Pause) All things got worse from day to day, you know. We didn't hear from my brother for a long, long long time and when we finally did, which I believe was months later, he was uh blessedly in the Russian occupied zone. He was in . And what apparently happened was that uh they were brought into the interior of Poland uh near the _....I don't know exactly what location...pursued by bullets. Those who were good swimmers swam across. He was a very good swimmer and he was in in , Which was uh <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> those things were very hard to come by but where we lived, you know, there there were vegetables and things were obtainable and our our neighbors... [hada __, you know, a nanny, who was wonderful to us and she lived diagonally across the street and she would go and get vegetables and bring things to us but uh my mother was always a wonderful needlewoman. She could do wonderful things with her hands, so we sort of through</p><p> that we would be knitting and I learned to...I learned to knit before the war but I wasn't particularly interested in that, you know. I was more of a tomboy running around with cats and climbing trees and and I settled down and we would start knitting sweaters for people. My mother really had a wonderful reputation. You know, she would embroider things on sweaters. She did some marvelous things and uh we would be able to get candles. We had quite a store of candles because uh we couldn't use the lamp too often because petroleum was available, you know, on only limited things and our ration card...we got ration card, you know, with the name Jew and and there was very little to eat and uh so uh my mother and I would would knit for as long as daylight would allow and my father would sit and read to us. And really this is how uh my father was wonderful..you see, I went to Polish schools. Even so, my first language was German...spoke German at home and when I would come home from school I would switch to German, but I couldn't read or write German, you know. I spoke it naturally. It was my first language. So my father unearthed my mother's books and he started teaching me to read and write German, and then my father would read to us, you know, and and we would let the candle go down. Then we would take take some wax and my mother made uh little wicks and we would put the candle on again and we would uh we would knit. We got...I remember it very clearly...for knitting a sweater, uh intricate sweater.</p><p>You know, at first I would just knit the sleeves and things and my mother would do the intricate work. We would get uh thirty . Well, it was thirty if you could buy food on ration it was fine, but we had to start buying food on the black market, so I would say uh roughly a loaf of bread would cost thirty marks so for knitting a sweater we would able to buy roughly a loaf of bread. And this is how things went. And then started the things of the , you know. It was uh to be sent away and every so often a <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> whatever was needed for for that purpose because uh then a note came to say we could stay. You know, , and that would happen roughly every six, seven months, and again I I don't know exactly that, but uh but is after we got, you know, my mother seemed to bounce back and became her her strong self and and from that time on I would say until the very end, my mother was absolutely a tower of strength. You know, looking back now, my mother was a very young woman at that time. She was she was forty-one when the war broke out. Of course to me she was an old woman, you know, to a fifteen year old girl, you know. My father was ten years older than my mother. So the existence, you know, and worse and thisis___ how we survived. This was three years...1939 through the spring of 1942. The very very spring...it could have been March perhaps when the order came that we had to move to the Jewish ghetto which was the shabby, remote part of our town, quite far away from where we had lived, because it was actually in you see. Uh Bielitz- it's called now, two , twin cities and that <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> know. My...as a matter of fact my my grandmother, my maternal grandmother, uh still celebrated Kaiser Franz Joseph, that's the Austrian Kaiser, uh birthday which is on the 18th of August which I still remember, you know and because uh and I think they all talked about the good old days, you know, the wars and you know, everybody has to think the good old days, but my father's family uh came from a place called and</p><p> was the seat of the which was he was very well know. As a matter of <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> amongst them. (Pause) We went to the station. My father stood in the...it was just dreadful. He wore the yellow star. (Pause)</p><p> TECHNICAL CONVERSATION</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: OK. You had just finished. We're back on camera, and you had just finished telling me about the orange your mother gave you for your eighteenth...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right. And then the order that my father's leaving. There is however one thing that I would like to mention as a tribute to my parents. Uh the last night before my father left...of course we all lived in one large room at that point...I heard my parents talking. I don't know if it was for them or for my benefit. They did not mention at all the parting in the morning, but they spoke about their years together. They were, you know, about about the happiness they had shared, about uh my brother's birth and mine, about the hopes they had for us, and I think in in death they have instilled something in me which which has been my legacy all this...uh the value of of the love, of the commitment, of the</p><p> of the family, and uh you know, when the going goes rough as it was in in <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> 0 uh watching by a shop which sold fabrics and uh remembering the type of fabric that my mother bought for a summer dress, but it wasn't colorfast. You know, it was such a...and yet it's very funny. I remember it in . [remember them now you know. Uh seeing some neighbor peering from behind the curtain, because you see we went in from from the ghetto, through through the town again to the other side of the town to which was called the where we went. Uh I marched with my mother. I saw a man with a cane. He asked me how old I was. I said eighteen. He told me to go to the left. We were loaded on trucks sometime later and I would like to get this over with as fast as I can, OK? And I heard my mother's voice...I did. And she was calling be strong, . And I heard that. I was in the truck. I jumped off and I said I want to go to my mother. The little man in a raincoat came by. Hisname was__. He was from . I don't know how he had this enormous strength. He was quite short. it was raining. He was wearing a raincoat and a hat. And he took me bodily and he threw me back on the truck and he said you are too young to die. So it was the man who probably sent my mother to her death decided I should not run back to her. We went to a place called . There was a ___ lager. It was transient camp and there was the 29th of June, 1942, a Monday. A long story _. I'll just confine it to my own....] had the opportunity of leaving there, cause of ____, you know, a boy who liked me. His parents tried to get me out of the .</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell me, tell us a little bit about that...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: . (Sigh) Anyway, in my naivete (ph) I made a decision that I did not want to go out ofthe __ to go back to Bielitz. There was...there were two camps in Beilitz and uh I mean again there's a story about a young man there who apparently liked me very much.</p><p>His name was . He was a very fine artist and uh his family suggested he __ with his family that you see you could get out ofthe __ if you uh had a place of work, if you had some working permit and uh that you can put, get out to...and uh he had two sisters and they had two sewing machines and they were willing to put one in a shop to secure a place for me, which was an incredible sacrifice. Uh however I knew that if I did that I would probably have to marry __. I made the decision not to go. Uh maybe this is a good story to tell because I that I uh I wanted to stay with my friends even though I knew I was going to camp. By strange, almost incredible coincidence, the man inthe who came and told me that I was able to go out...his name is Jacob Chancer (ph). He now lives in Buffalo, New York, where of course I lived for many years. That decision proved to be a decision which saved my life because unfortunately the Briggs (ph) family, all of them, were deported and killed about two months later. And you see uh Beilitz, my home town, was renown for its textiles. Uh it was called of central Europe. And uh in the they registered your name, your age, and the place you hail from (ph), and industrialists from all over Germany would come to buy slaves. A man by the name of Keller (ph)...I think it's good to use the names...his name was Director Keller from a firm called 5 had several uh spinning uh weaving and uh <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> 1 always looking because you see that still fairly early. That was "42. They needed German speaking people to be trained, so he bought all of us for a place called Bolkenhein (ph) which was a new weaving camp in . And in fact this is where we went. In all <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> 2 she didn't...she won that bet. Anyway we came to Bolkenheim. Bolkenheim...you know uh it's a terrible thing to say but but I think because we are recording that sort of thing should be said...actually for me it it was easier then. Easier in terms that I didn't see my parents suffer. You know, I could sort of put things over there but I uh I was convinced that my parents will survive, that they are someplace which they are probably working. I pushed all thoughts aside and I was in a way liberated in fact but you know I wasn't worried that each of my action might spell danger to my parents. And you know, I know if somebody's going to beat me, they aren't going to see it. All the indignities that one has suffered and you know and vice versa, you know. But of course when you're eighteen years old you know, you have the _ that you don't...anyway uh Bolkenheim was rough in terms until we mastered what was expected of us. There was somebody there by the name of Meister Zimmer (ph). He was dreadful. And uh I used to amuse myself when he told us all things, you know, that uh that we are going to be taught decency and all the things, you know, uh that I think that that we knew so well which obviously were were designed to break our resistance, you know, and said if we behave ourselves and do these things we can live there all our lives you know, and I used to sort of speculate what he would look like when he was dead and things like that, you know. Uh now L...I...you know, fortunately uh you know I I always wrote when I was a little girl and things like that and I I could lift myself from some of the things and do other things in my mind to remove that, and I think I did that in the very first weeks when we were there. But you know, he used to sit with, stand with a watch, with a stop watch, and you had to do</p><p> which are uh was very intricate uh...what do you call it...it's funny...I lapse into <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> 3 Tape #2</p><p> TECHNICAL CONVERSATION</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: OK. We are back on tape.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: OK.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: OK. You were telling me about uh the camp and the weaving...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The weaving...(pause)...we were able to write letters and again in that uh Mrs. Keegler was quite generous because I don't remember exactly, you know, what the ratio was, how often you were permitted to, but of course you know there were...who could you write to, but I was fortunate that I had my father's address in which way my father was allegedly working on the fortification of that river and uh I wrote to my father. Uh I did not hear. Of course I heard from and I wrote to him and he started sending me letters as well as packages which again through the type of person that Mrs. Keegler was, those packages did arrive. Uh I wrote to my father and I waited to hear from my father and one day a most incredible thing happened. Mrs. Keegler was handing out mail and she called my name and I saw a letter and I jumped to get it, and then I realized it was the letter which I had wrote written to my father and on it it said, without forwarding address.</p><p>Uh I think that we needn't go into that. No one think that I I lost my my speech for a day and a night. I I could not utter a sound. Anyway uh we worked there and uh the thing was uh, you see, the type of thing that I I don't know if it really comes across is the tremendous support system which existed in the camps. The love and the friendship and the sharing and caring and loyalties that people had for each other, the girls had for each other. Uh you know that was sort of the balance against the cruelty which we experienced and to me I feel that was probably one of the most important things that existed and I somehow wish that would filter down. I usually attempt to tell my children and now my grandchildren because in the very odd spiritual airs of those who did not survive to know that the legacy of the camps is not the legacy of the horror but of the greatness of our people, the very humanity which existed there in the face of such incredible inhumanity.</p><p>Uh I particularly want to talk about my friend Yelda (ph) for a moment but that actually happened in in another camp. I I'll give you the quick progression from camp to camp.</p><p>We were in Waldenheim, if I remember correctly when you know we were working on looms and pretty soon uh the raw materials started to disappear. We we had to uh work on uh uh paper. There was paper that they were spinning and of course you know in the warm weather it became brittle and it would break and uh in cold weather it would disintegrate because it got soft, and uh was, you know, those things tore the <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> 4 and I was running a very high fever and we had sort of a little...it was called in <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> 5 and he always knew what I was thinking, and I remember he came behind me and he said, without looking at me, he said, what you are thinking now is cowardly. He said promise that you are never going to do that. I didn't answer him and he took his hand and he turned my head towards him and he said I want your promise now. And I promised him. And I remembered it during the working in the coal trucks. There were trains going by. I didn't know if they were going to Auschwitz or whatever, and I remember sort of the tracks beckoning in the moonlight and I thought, you know, it would be over very quick. One jump and one pain and that's going to be it because it was so dreadful there.</p><p>And at one moment I think I really came fairly close. I felt a very strange pain in my neck. Anyway, obviously I didn't do it. So...when things were really very very hard in Matzdorf we worked in the swamp one days and I think that was really one of my lowest hours, when...we had a lager fuhrer in there who was the exact opposite of Mrs. Keegler.</p><p>She was maybe eighteen years old, sort of an over-blown thing and she was wearing rings on every finger and uh and her great joy was to have a little wagon, like a child's wagon, and she had us pull her around in that wagon. She was having a whip about it...I mean, you can't imagine the calibre of or the intelligence of that person. And all of a sudden she came with somebody else, with a man, and they said...they were calling numbers. You see we all had numbers, of course. And they were calling numbers and I was working next to Yelda and heard them call her number, and I sort of looked up. I must have been dazed, and she pointed and the lager fuhrer and said you idiots. Don't you even know your own numbers, and Yelda pointed to me and she said that is her number. I didn't understand what she was doing. She obviously wanted to get me out from whatever it was, so the lager came and naturally slapped me and she said don't you even know your own number, you idiot and so I...and since they called my real number and we didn't know what was happening or maybe Yelda...I'm I'm really not quite sure on that, but what happened was as we came to the camp, there was Director Keller from Waldenheim. Also I have an interesting thing to tell you about him. And Yelda fell to her knees and she said my sister, you don't have her number, something like that, and he looked at me and he says I know you. You worked on four looms. You're coming along.</p><p>They needed more people for uh working on looms in another camp called Landeshutz (ph) and this is how I got out of Matzdorf and Yelda was on it too and we got loaded on a truck and we went to Landeshutz which was the other, the sister camp. Yousee _if they had crossbars behind the open Landeshutz to Matzdorf and one more ____ and when we got there, who would be there but Frau Keegler was in charge of that camp, so that was like a homecoming. So this is how...] had one incident with Keller. He called me into his office once and I just remember this most incredible thing. There was that hugh hugh room or at least to me it seemed hugh with a single carpet and a desk on it and he sat alone at the desk and what struck me is that probably in a room of that size, fifty of us slept. You know, I think that...and he had a letter in his hand and he said to me you have smuggled out a letter from the camp . said I never smuggled a letter. I said I have <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> 6</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Who had written to who?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My uncle had...when he found out in what camp I was, had written to my, to Keller about me because he had that thing in his...Keller looked at me and he asked me a number of questions. Interesting thing was that apparently my uncle had sent a package and they encouraged me to write for more packages. The packages apparently contained chocolate and things which were not obtainable, which I never saw. They said the package must have been ripped up but it looked in a very sturdy wooden box but I was only too happy to write to my uncle that I received the packages I was told in very good order because apparently they wanted those things but this way I knew that my uncle was...I mean I knew my uncle was safe. He was in Turkey but that he knew where I was. Anyway getting back to the thing...of course we came to Landeshutz which like heaven by comparison with Matzdorf. Uh only in Landeshutz we then faced an...another difficulty.</p><p>And that difficulty was that we worked the night shift only. So you know, we didn't see any light of day except, you know, uh if you got up during the day you you could and we worked there from probably a year or maybe even longer, on the night shift, but you know Frau Keegler was there. Things got worse there because there was very little food but uh she she went on in the same vein that she was before, you know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell us a little bit more about Landeshutz and Frau Keegler...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Uh for instance, you know, if somebody was ill, if somebody got ill, you know, there were not the things which happened in other camps, sent to Auschwitz or beatings or things like that. Uh you got some sort of care or understanding or it was...things were covered for you a bit, you know, as far as work was concerned. Uh she tried to to get vegetables. I don't know what rations there were, you know, but it it whatever was so- called coming to us and believe me things were uh laughable but we got it. Uh I remember when this one thing that I always tell young people. Uh you know they knew of the Jewish holidays and there was one Yom Kippur when they marched us out and told us about the holidays and told uh that if anybody would be foolish enough to fast that that would be construed as sabotage and sabotage was punishable by death, and everybody fasted and uh we were given noodles and sugar and nobody touched it and I think you know those are the things that I think future generations should know and to me this was...and I remember then that night when we got our miserable smelling vegetables or whatever it was, there was such a feeling of sanctity, I think almost holiness, you know, and they really jumped. She tried to to see that we you know if if we didn't...everybody worked with uh uh you know al...almost with with such fervor and things that we couldn't falter. And I think that without such a oneness, such a...I saw so much nobility of spirit in the camps which somehow I wish would be better recorded, you know, when people reached out, you know...somebody had a birthday so uh we would uh save...on Sunday we had margarine, a little margarine on the bread, so you know you would cut off some of the bread and scrape the margarine and and give it to the person on the bread that she would have a lot of margarine on on her piece of bread. On Hanukkah, we knew it was <span class="page-break" number="11"></span> 7 Hanukkah and that was still under Mrs. Keegler, and she was busy celebrating... Hanukkah and Christmas are together...you know, and she closed an eye to that sort of thing. We uh made a menorah (ph) out of potatoes and uh of course we knew that you know we couldn't light ____ but we made a menorah out of potatoes and I I still have the things which I wrote about the story about Hanukkah which we sang. I would like to translate it and give it to you. I had a wonder...if I may skip for one minute just to make a happier thing...when I went to Israel for the first time in 1961 I my friends surprised me. I knew of three that were in Israel but actually ten showed up and I was the eleventh, and they got out of the elevator in Tel Aviv, singing a song which we had written for the first Hanukkah in camp, and we carried the menorah which I naturally have now, a beautiful old silver menorah that they give me in memory of the menorah which we made out of the potatoes, and you know when you made it out of potatoes it meant you didn't eat that night because, you know, you didn't have potatoes. You can imagine what that menorah means when my husband kindles the lights and we see our grandchild reflected in that...it's truly . Uhso you know, that was possible under Frau Keegler and one of the things that we did was Yelda and I dressed as grandmothers and you know, under the looms which we worked there was sort of a white powdery substance. We put it on our hair to grey and uh and we had a performance between the bunks under one naked electric light and see the faces in the bunks, you know. What we did is we started out with uh you know there were two grandmothers and everything, and comestothe -- and___ssays oh . That's how how it started out and then we of course predicted a brilliant future for everyone and then our two granddaughters came to listen to us. Strangely enough the person who played my granddaughter...her name is Hilda Steinhart Goldschmidt (ph). She lives in Israel. Her son was one of the heros of the Six Day War. Hilda never lived to have a grandchild and so the one who played her granddaughter did not survive and our granddaughters listened to our tale of the past and uh I'll say it in German. The exit line on that was uh . Do you understand German?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Uh come and look. I'll show you my newest , you know, what the granddaughter says... , OK. Then the , because old people uh exaggerate so much and then we see them exiting. Now mind you we were eighteen years old at the time and we say to each other, . Dear children, let us just say that uh humans <span class="page-break" number="12"></span> 8 we were taken early yet, you know, before Auschwitz was in its full__ aspect of the...because after that people didn't go to working camps anymore. OK. Briefly uh and finally Landeshutz was liquidated and we went to the most miserable and bitter camp called Gruenberg (ph) in . Uh Gruenberg was an enormous camp. Uh its factory was one of the most beautiful in Germany in as much that it boasted the most beautiful collection of roses surrounding the factory. It was direct contradiction of the beauty the ___ was in. Uh I don't remember his name now...we called him LaLouche (ph). I will have to remember his name. That was the most brutal, sadistic uh...I don't know if he was director but he was one of the people there. He wore a signet ring on his hand and and he would jump like a cat and beat his victim until blood showed, mostly beat the faces. He would have sort of a glazed look on his face. I don't know if...I tried to suppress the feeling...we called him Lalouche. He was a beast. Uh things changed very drastically then. I still worked in uh for a very little time in the weaving factories, but pretty soon they had very little raw material for that and I was moved into what was considered sentence of death...spin___...spinning. Uh we were spinning fabrics or rather threads which came from raw materials which...the raw material consisted of clothing which came from Auschwitz. It came to a place called .___ are hugh machines which sort of shred that. Uh it was not difficult to imagine that some of the clothes belonged to our parents. Uh I worked most of the time on the night shift there and I remember when whenever the the horror of some of that became overwhelming, one or at least I played a game. I perfected it. And that was to imagine my homecoming, with all the details being there including the sort of things that we had long sold but it was the miracle of freedom would always be there. In any event, the most dreaded thing on in Gruenberg was that...I'm not quite sure now if it was every four or every six weeks...we would go toa doctor's office to be x-rayed because tuberculous was rampant and whoever displayed anything was immediately sent to Auschwitz, so you had to leave some life, usually between four and six weeks...I don't remember now if it was four or six weeks. Uh there was something there with those x-rays. I uh did a thing which I will always regret. Uh the last day that I was with my brother, we had to go to the which was something that <span class="page-break" number="12"></span> 9 did, everybody was beaten and to say who who got it. I'm proud to say about our people that nobody gave away the culprit. We all knew who it was, and I think that this is that...you know, uh what has troubled me so much that I have read some of the accounts that people say how cruel people were, how they stepped on each other, or they make it sound like it was like a snake pit that people __ for survival. Look, I don't know what happened in other camps, and this is why, you know, I have always used my maiden name on everything that I have written . | would say that people behaved in the most incredible manner imaginable by and large. And I think that this would be something that cannot be emphasized enough. It was in Gruenberg that Yelda once found a raspberry in the gutter on the way to the factory. She carried it in her pocket all day long and presented it to me that night on a leaf which she plucked through the barbed wire, had washed it, and gave it to me as a present. I asked her to take a little bit of a bite and she wouldn't. One single raspberry. A total possession. She gave it to a friend. There were other acts like that, many. They unfortunately are not recorded. And I think this is probably the greatest tragedy of them all. The nobility and the love that was felt. Anyway when things got really bad, you know, you sort of knew when things are going bad for the Germans, they're probably going to finish us. When things are going good for for them or well for them I should say, uh they aren't going to let us go. I know we will forever be slave, you know. It sort of varies what is going to happen, and that became our obvious in January of 1945 where one day uh we knew...we were told we were not going to go to the factory any longer, to gather our meager belongings of whatever that was. Uh the night between the 28th and 29th of January, with great commotion and suddenly the doors opened. The camp, you know...we we were then about two thousand girls. An additional transport of two thousand came from Auschwitz. They told us they had walked for I don't know how long from Auschwitz and we were going to to go on a march the following morning. Destination later on we heard Orianienberg. Orianienberg was a murder camp also, small enough known near Berlin which fell into the hands of the Allies when General Eisenhower made his swift move on Berlin and we started to march now to to...the death march, 29th of January. I remember I had a terrible cold. I was coughing terribly. Uh we were told to assemble in four abreast. Was Yelda, Suzie and Leisle (ph). Leisle was probably the most beautiful girl I had ever seen. She sort of...she moved like a deer, had hugh brown eyes, __. She and Suzie were were sort of like sisters as Yelda was and I, you know, but the four of us together. Lei...Leisle was from</p><p> from Czechoslovakia and Suzie was from Czechoslovakia and Yelda and I from <span class="page-break" number="13"></span> 0 started the first step and I remember taking that step and I remember saying to myself this is the last chapter. But you know, I never had any doubt that we'll make it. And Yelda was to my left, Leisle next to me and Suzie on the extreme right. And I'm the only one left. I think the march is documented in I'm sure many other stories. (Pause) It was unspeakable. I had my skiing boots. I was the best equipped because I had my boots.</p><p>It...(pause)...at first we still had a little bit to eat that we took along and hoarded. We marched I don't know how many miles a day. We came to rest sometimes in in a barn. A lot of...we stopped in a camp called __ where blessedly a few of our girls escaped. I didn't. Uh people were shot continuously. If somebody stepped out of line, then you would see snow being red and there through the forest, beautifully covered with snow and birds chirped sometimes and uh we were marching. Everyday the number got smaller and then we came (sniffling) to a place called Flossenberg and in Flossenberg, Yelda was already very sick. Leisle, Suzie and I were still going pretty strong. One time we had nothing to eat so we started eating snow which was a terrible thing to do because the more you eat, the more thirsty you are. And of course then diarhhrea and all was rampant.</p><p>Uh when we left one morning, one time they uh put us outside. They would spray us with water and then they would herd us, literally hundreds into a small ___ and everybody started to perspire, put us out again and pneumonia was just like that (snapping fingers)...people died like flies. Then one morning we were told, for example, we were going to leave there. | remember Yelda was frantic. She said that's going to be the end. I don't want to leave. And I said if we are so much better off out in you know in the open.</p><p>Maybe we'll have a better chance. And all of a sudden came in an incredible announcement, that President Roosevelt died. Then I knew it was too late to run because you know we reconstructed at the time was and jubilation broke out, that all the enemies of the Fuhrer will perish in such a manner. It was a horrible blow, horrible. But we found something that day which sort of compensated us a little for that. We found a wrapper of margarine and there was still some little vestiges of margarine stuck to it, so we licked it dry. We thought we'll certainly get very strong. And things got very bad from then on.</p><p>Yelda was really very, very bad. And one night we slept in...we all used to sleep outside and uh it started to snow and sort of reminded me of the story, you know, there's little</p><p> and went around that everybody don't sleep, get up, because if you fall <span class="page-break" number="14"></span> 1 the Wermarcht and in order to get the numbers if we felt you know , we used our <span class="page-break" number="14"></span> 2 the sun got up, it was over for her. And we were told to bury the dead of that night. I couldn't do it. It's strange...I know she was buried because my friend told me under a tree.</p><p>I remember the most minute details and places, names of cities and towns where we went through...I still and I cannot remember the name of the place where she died. I can't. And sometimes I wonder perhaps it is so that that every tree sort of reminds me of her. You know, she's become over the years my my alterego, my __ with my childhood. And every year on the 29th of April I sort of step back and did for me some incredible things that happened on the 29th. In the past how many years, forty-eight years...no, forty-five, forty-five years. Forty-nine...from 1945. I didn't see Suzie and Leisle. I didn't know where they were because by that point I couldn't walk very well myself and I don't know now if it was a few days later, whatever, they really descended on us, and with tremendous vengeance, screaming it was all our fault because the Fuhrer is told...you know, Hitler is dead. We felt if it was true then either they're going to kill us now or maybe we will survive. It was uh we came to a place in Czechoslovakia...things were really quite crazy, you know. A lot of people were on on the roads again and uh soldiers running away and but we were still with the group. We had one woman SS with us and a couple of men. I don't know to to how few our group had uh...it diminished enormously from thousands to a handful, maybe a little over a hundred and I I think I was quite ill already, you know, because...I know, I mean I was ill anyway and and terrible upset about, you know, Yelda's death and uh one evening we came to rest...was a place...oh, a place in Czechoslovakia. We were in Czechoslovakia at that point, of course. And and that place was called which I only realized that later. Uh we were sort of <span class="page-break" number="15"></span> 3 overhead and everything, and then the story had it uh that they uh attached a time bomb.</p><p>It was strange...we just went my husband and I to a reunion of the 5th Division Medical Corps who were our liberators and they spoke about that bomb and how the ____ was there. I mean, you know, for a while we thought you know maybe they just threatened it was a bomb or something but apparently that was so, and they barricaded the doors with chains and things and we, you know, we sort to moved. They told that we are going to be killed and I think before that there was some shooting. I remember some shooting was going on like it was here and there. Nothing nothing happened...just a little skin, and uh you know, at that point I must confess that I'm not absolutely clear. Must have been quite ill already or or whatever but I remember sort of that night it was quite turbulent and I remember them curling up and sort of uh the SS left and they left their coats and things behind and I sort of went and and tried to sleep there. A lot of people were very ill. We knew the Americans were coming. I saw two the night before, and then there was the crazy night and in the morning I asked where...I asked Leisle...she was...this was the biggest irony of them all. They were shooting from planes and Suzie was hit in the foot.</p><p>Not Suzie, Leisle. And she was lying there on the straw and I asked her where Suzie was.</p><p>It was morning and she told me that Suzie went to find some water at the pump and I went to look for her and there she was, lying in the mud and she was dead. And I didn't want to go back to tell Leisle that. So I 1 went out. You see, I had seen...there were two Americans the night before. I spoke to them sort of. But that that is very vague to me. But I remember all the things of that morning and that was after I had found Suzie and I couldn't tell Leisle so I went outside and I stood sort of in the doorway. It was a brilliant morning. Oh yes. I have to tell you that I saw that morning on a steeple of the church a homemade white flag of peace. And I remember that was the first time I cried in many many months. It was a strange thing that I remember that my tears...you know, it's funny because now I cry at the slightest provocation. I cry when I see a dog or cat or something like that but didn't cry for many years. And uh and I was standing there and saw and all of a sudden I saw (pause) a strange car coming down the hill, no longer green, not bearing the swastika, but a white star. It was sort of a mud-splattered vehicle but I've never seen a star brighter in my life and two men sort of jumped out, came running towards us and one came toward where I stood. He was wearing battle gear. I have to think...you know, his helmet was this mesh over that and he was wearing dark glasses and he spoke to me in German and he said, does anybody here speak German or English, and I said I speak German. And I felt that I could tell him we are Jewish and didn't know if you would know what the star means or anything, but you know and I uh I was a little afraid to tell him that but I said to him, we are Jewish, you know. And he didn't answer me for quite a while. And then his own voice sort of betrayed his own emotions and he said, so am I. I was...it was the greatest hour of my life. And then he asked an incredible question. He said, may I see the other ladies? You know, was we have been <span class="page-break" number="16"></span> 4 for me and let me precede him and in that gesture he start me to feel and that young <span class="page-break" number="16"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
