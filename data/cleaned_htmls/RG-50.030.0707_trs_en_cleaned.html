<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, then my mother, my brother and I left for the United States. My father could not come to the states because the United States had a quota system and they -- they put him on the Romanian quot</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: As I said, he was born in this little town that was on the boarder of then Hungary and Romania, and the immigration authorities in their wisdom decided that he was Romanian and couldn't come in. So he went -- he left and I don't know how. He did not come with us on that ship. He went on -- he went to Canada, supposedly, to attend the medical congress and then he crossed -- he came to New York illegally and was caught.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And so how did you travel from New York to Ecuador?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. That's actually a good point.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And we even on the trip to New York.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Through this time, you always had enough to eat and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- food wasn't an issue?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Me, too. We are lucky.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. No. That's why I've always said, you know, I'm not sure if I can be considered a survivor because I really didn't suffer.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But surviving doesn't --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: It changed my life --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Absolutely.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- completely.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You should never have been forced to leave your home.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And you survived by escaping --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- from the persecution.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="27"></span>  Interview with Eva Desrosiers 31</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, I know, and, you know, that's what -- that's one reason I've never approached the Holocaust Museum until now.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Well, whenever you feel it's time, that's fine. And I understand that many, maybe, people who lived in exile or refugees or those who escaped, however they --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- term themselves, sometimes have difficulty with the word survivor.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, I mean, you know, I never, thank goodness, was into a concentration camp. I never --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- suffered the horrors that these people --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But you still should not have been forced to go through what you went through.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. I realize that, but, as I said, that's why I've always felt kind of guilty.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Guilty?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Survivor's guilt is right there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. So you can feel or see that clearly in your mind?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you think the rest of your family felt that way?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I'm sure they did.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Sometimes people say there's no such thing as survivor guilt.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I wouldn't.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="28"></span>  Interview with Eva Desrosiers 32</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I wouldn't either, but --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. I mean, I feel -- I remember the first day I went -- many years ago -- several years ago I went to the museum.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: This is the Holocaust Museum?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.

I shouldn't have been --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: That's okay. Gives more emphasis. Yeah. It could have been you.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It could have been me. Yeah. Very easily could have been me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And so I --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And I think I --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I think I understand without being able to know it myself, of course.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I could see how that would feel.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And, again, how that was -- I mean, that was my uncle and aunt had made those arrangements to -- with her family.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But do you think each leg from New York to Panama, Panama onward was planned before you left New York or do you think they figured it out --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I think it was planned from New York, yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And so where did this next ship take you?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And we were in this very dark pension (ph) and somebody, some relative had sent me for my birthday, which was June 10th, a Spanish version of Anderson's Fairy Tails. And I remember on my birthday my father was sitting in this dark room with me and the dictionary trying to read the book to me. And I didn't want to stay there.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, not -- it wasn't like that, but it was some sort of -- not as bad as the Japanese.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No, no.</p></p></dialogue>
