<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: N -- no, see there -- they followed the Swiss mentality, that we -- they had to keep the children, you know, more in -- in schools, maybe, in boarding schools, things like that. And str -- strange with it -- I mean being -- not being soft. See, I used to get in my window in -- in Drama and look outside. And I used to see boys or girls, you know, with no shoes because they were poor, walking in the rain. And I used to be to -- envy them that they were free, and I didn't have that freedom.</p></p></dialogue>

And they didn't have a good -- they didn't talk well about their -- the poor, they thought they were peasants. They didn't have manners, they didn't have anything. They [indecipherable]. And I started thinking like them, and now when I think of myself, I'm -- I'm -- you know, I feel bad about it, because if we didn't have that -- all these people, that they work so hard, a-and they were good, and everything, you know, we wouldn't have the things that we have today. It's because of them that we live better. And only when I came here, and I was living the way I wanted to live, you know, but I started thinking, poor -- poor people, you know, working on the streets with this heat, and every -- how they can manage? And what I'm doing? Nothing, in comparison with them. You know? And I started feeling different about people.</p></p></dialogue>

I was sit -- there were some people sitting with me, and they were talking about the Jews. And of course, not good things. And -- and I only was listening, and I didn't say anything. And then finally one of them said to me, "Well, we don't hear anything from you, you know, what do you think about the Jews?" "Well," I said, "you're looking to one of them." And they became all red, you know, and said, "But you're better than we are." See, they were from villa -- not villages, places where they didn't have any - - they -- they knew nothing about Jews. Whatever their church will tell them, that we killed Jesus, and we -- they didn't even know that Jesus was a Jew, you know.</p></p></dialogue>

And -- am I right that you tell me when he wanted to call his wife he would come to your house, because he could be private, and nobody would be listening. So your -- your family was not only wealthy and -- and prominent in terms of being wealthy, but they were very well connected in terms of people who knew what was going on in the world.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.

So we left him alone with a family, but he couldn't stand it there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: He couldn't stand it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, because he wanted to be with us. And he wrote a letter to my mother, and I have to read it again, because I forgot it.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right, the Italians were stopped, or at least there's a stalemate, they can't get through. But then the Germans come in, and they do win, and they divide the country into three parts.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But the archbishop didn't want to give us away, but at the end, couldn't make it.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Ancient theater, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Ancient theater, we -- has a -- has a better acoustics than the latest theater here in the United States.

My piano teacher, that she used to tell me that she was Jewish, and she was German, she was with the Germans.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: She was with them. So that must have been a big shock, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And to have the Germans behind us, but we weren't afraid at that time, you know? It's when they started taking the Jews and putting them in -- in Haidari, the prison in Greece, then --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Then you got worried.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: We thought that this was momentarily, and finally you know that, and understand that they were all --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: That they would stop.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, but we were wrong with that.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: You never get hot or sweating, or --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: No matter when, in the year, really? It sounds wonderful. Were there restrictions once the Germans took over Athens? Did you have to wear a Jewish star --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No Jewish star?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. They took us all of the sudden, you know, it seemed, that they decided to take us in -- in Athens. I don't know what they did in Salonika.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: They asked to show up in the synagogue. I don't know too much because, see, I wasn't with the -- the rest of the Jews to see --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yes, yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- what was going on. See, I was i-inside with this family. And --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: No, I'm talking about before you're in hiding.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Probably -- no, probably that -- that's when I used to go to school.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, was everybody stopped from going to school, or only the Jewish students, do you remember?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I tell you the -- I don't remember --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You don't remember, okay.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- Imi -- I don't -- I don't know what the other children did.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right, right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because I was with Christians, Greeks. Orthodox Greeks.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes. So you don't know, huh?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't know much.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So who ma -- the su -- was there a discussion in your house about hiding?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: There was?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And then is when we came in contact with all our friends. They said you can come out in house whenever you want, in the evening, any time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And the last house that we went to before we were caught, they had the big house, they send the maids away because they were afraid that the maids may say something. And they enclosed themselves in one room, and they gave us the rest of the house -- to us, and my father said, "Why are you doing this?" "Well," she said, "because I want to show that there are nice people out</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="40"></span> </p><p> there -- there -- there were, because we can go out, we are free to go out any time we want to.</p><p>But you stay home, and you need more room and everything." So they did that, and the love that they show us, and they used to bring us food and this and that -- amazing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Really? So you didn't just stay with one family during this -- is it --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, n-no, about two or three families.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Two or three families. And who ma -- did your father make the decision that you sh -- you should hide, or was it obvious, there were a lot of families who were doing this?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, because when we thought that someone has seen one of us, because my brother used to walk around, but he thought someone saw him, or someone may see him, or someone saw me in the -- in the window --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right, right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You know. We had to move.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did you look -- I don't know what it means in Greece. In Poland it seems that some Jews looked Jewish to Polish Catholics. Was there a look, so that if someone saw Haim they would think he was a Jewish --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: N-No, no, but there were some that look -- so. But ma -- the majority looked like a -- like a --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Like everybody else.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But when you say Haim might be seen, it was because he was known to be Jewish --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- not because he looked Jewish, I see. So were you afraid of these Germans now? Did -- at some point did you become afraid of these guys?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: If -- we're afraid now, or then?</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="41"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No, no, no, then.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Then.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When -- when you went into hiding.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, until we went to Haidari, I wasn't afraid.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh, okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It -- Haidari they put us in a room with two other people, and -- and then after that they put us all together in one big room, where we stayed there, and after a week they send us to -- put us in trains.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In trains, to Auschwitz.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: To Auschwitz.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So the hiding period is not such a terrible period because you're with people who know you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Who care about you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In Greece, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In Greece, and want to be good to you. But your life is all indoors, because the Germans are clearly looking for Jews, yes?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Or someone will tell them --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- there, because the Germans didn't know --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- who were Jews, and who were not, you know. Or, we didn't have ghettos like --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- other places. We lived everywhere.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="42"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right, right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So they couldn't know unless somebody told them that these are Jews.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. Now, your father is not working when you're in hiding, or is he going in and out?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, he stays in.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: He stays -- he stays inside. Do you think your father is -- is -- is helping with the cost of keeping you there by paying people, or are these wealthy people and they don't want money?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, they don't want money, but my father was -- didn't want them to spend all their money, you know?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right, right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We used to give them money.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, what happened to the house that you had bought? You just left that house, with now less clothes, I assume, and go into hiding. So each time you move, you have less and less things.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>Is there something that you take with you because you -- some, I don't know --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, I tell you, when we were caught, we decided that -- we used to listen the radio, th-the British --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: BBC.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- telling us all the time that we're coming, this and that, and years went by and nothing happened. And my father was still very young, and my brother, they were getting tired. We leave the country. [inaudible]. So we decided to go to Egypt, and from Egypt to Israel, and -- and we decided that we're -- we're going to get dressed as if we're going to a wedding, in case they si -- they stop us, we'll tell them that we are going to a wedding. And that's what happened. And a friend of ours -- you see, we had so many friend -- one of them gave us up. He [indecipherable]</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="43"></span> </p><p> in Germany, and we thought that he was working for the Greek government, trying to find out things from the Germans. And maybe he did, but he was on both sides.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Both sides.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And maybe the Germans found out that he was hiding Jews, who knows if he gave us up. And all of a sudden Germans stop us going to the -- to the ship, and since I knew German, I got out of the car, and I said, "I don't understand why you taking us. I mean now, as you see, we are dressed, we are going to a wedding." He said, "Fraulein, we know everything about you. You don't have to tell us any more." Mm-hm. "So you'll come with us." And they took us to a place to -- where the Germans were. And they started to interrogate first my father and my brother. So they came back, when they came back I was so scared to look at them, because my father didn't have the front teeth, and you know, it seems that they hit them. So then they came to pick us up, my mother and myself. And I spoke to them in German because I knew German, and -- and probably that's the reason they didn't behave bad with us, they didn't do anything to us. So we went back to the room where my brother and [indecipherable] and my brother comes to me and says, "You are no longer my sister." I said, "Why?" "Why they didn't do anything to you? Look at us," you know. "Probably you told them where our relatives are." I say, "I wouldn't do that for anything in the world. They ask me, and do you know what I told them? In -- in German, I told them, and they didn't hit me." So, I told the Germans, I know where my -- I don't know where my relatives are, but even if I knew it, I wouldn't tell you. So they started laughing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The Germans started laughing?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So then after that they let me -- let us go, you know? And my brother was very mad at me thinking that if they let us go like that, without hitting us, I told them where my relatives are and</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="44"></span> </p><p> so forth.

It was a woman from a school, a Jewish woman, but she used to teach that school, it was for advanced children. And they told her to -- to whom to come, and she came to me. I liked her very much. And I said, "Well why you want me? You see that I have difficulty, and," -- I said, "I can tell you -- I can tell you which people you can go to, and th-they help you out better." "No," she said, "I want you." And she kept coming, coming at my house until she made me go. I said, "Okay, but we won't let my daughter come, because she's going to be  <span class="page-break" number="82"></span> </p><p> embarrassed." So -- and she didn't come, we didn't tell her.

I -- I th -- I thought that I won't be able to -- to talk, and I said I'Il embarrass everybody, you know? But they liked it. And -- and they keep asking me again and again, but I said, "I don't know what happened that day," I said, "it's a miracle, because I -- I can't -- I can't discuss."</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did it mean something to you that they were so involved?

And -- and the one Jewish girl, her mother ma -- married a -- a Jew, and her mother was -- she said that, "If I lived at that time in Europe," she said, "that's what they will do to me, too, even though." I said yes. It doesn't make [indecipherable]. I had to be honest, you know. Because it doesn't -- if one of the parent Jew, they go.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. So, if that was so meaningful, why do you think you didn't do it again? You think it was some miracle? It was some odd event?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: It couldn't have been me, I couldn't [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: It couldn't be you?

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell me something, what do you -- what did all of this teach you, you think?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, it teaches me to learn lessons from the past, and not to ne -- e -- repeat them again, because we're getting more interesting, more intelligent, it's -- it's why go through this?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You think the world has changed?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah, they can see all these things.

So --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So do you really think people can learn from the past?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't think, no.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But you as an individual, did you think that these events changed you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Of course I'm not the same person that I was before, but I'm stronger. Maybe you see me now walking when I [indecipherable] today I wasn't feeling well. But I feel strong inside of me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And I feel like we have to do the best we can, and talk. Talk not maliciously, talk in the way that we can understand each other, and be friends with each other.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And everybody can, if they want to pray to God, or they want to pray to Christ, and they can do that. But you can -- there's no reason for us not to talk, not to be friends. We all are children of God.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But you also learned that from your father, didn't you, in some way?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well -- well, I -- I think I learned more from my uncle [indecipherable] than my father.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="84"></span> </p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was -- yes. And you're more religious now than you were when you were a child, when you were younger, or not?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I believe -- n-now I believe that our religion makes sense, you know? And I don't see any other makes sense as a -- as ours. And I think it's superior. And I feel like how can anybody believe anything else, you know, and we do. We made mistakes, too.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But still, I think, we gave the best to the world.</p></p></dialogue>
