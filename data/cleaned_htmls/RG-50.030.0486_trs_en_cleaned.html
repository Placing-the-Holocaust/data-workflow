We had little time to say good-bye to our mothers, and they faded away forever. We felt exhausted. The place was like hell. The smoke was getting thicker. We didn't know then, and we learned the following day that the smoke was the result of burning our parents." She says [indecipherable]. "I had no time to cry. Our nightmare had just started. As I turned around, I saw Rachelle with all her hair gone. I felt a sudden sadness, and I cried." That's when they took my hair.</p></p></dialogue>
