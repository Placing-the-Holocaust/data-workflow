<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: My name is Max Haber. I was born on the 31st of December, 1904, in Essen on the Ruhr [River], Germany.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Tell me about your childhood as you were growing up.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: My childhood up to the First World War, which started when I was 9 years old, was a nice one, a happy one. In fact, my father took us and my uncle to visit our grandparents in Kolomier. In other words, in those 5 weeks that I was there, I met my grandparents and I still remember when we went back to Germany, he asked me, "What is your name?" I said, "Max. Max." He said, "No." He said, "Moshe." Uh...then he said, this what I wanted to know from you. When you go to Germany, I'd like to stay a good Jew. And I think my father did everything and myself to follow his advice. After then during the war time, we were very hungry. We did have very little to eat. There was a blockade against Germany. My father was in the army, and my brother was taken a little bit later into the army. But they came back in 1918, 19 and life was normal. I learned my trade. Was an ___ export refinery for non- ferrous metals. We had different....we had different...uh...uh... departments and I chose to be in the metal department. By the way this trade I continued here when I came to Chicago.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Max. Excuse me. Tell me about...before we go on, being a Jew, being raised as a Jew.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>Uh...What kind of school did you go to?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The school T attended was an orthodox school]. real orthodox school. _ Our teachers <span class="page-break" number="0"></span></p><p> still a baby, we moved from Essen on the Ruhr to Homburg. In...uh...[ became a businessman and was even for myself in business until I had to give it up when Hitler came to power. And end of 1933, my father having passed away and buried now in Homburg, I remained with my mother because my brother and my sister lived already in the East.</p><p>My...my sister married and my brother had to...in order to be...to be a doctor, practicing doctor, had to go there where he was born. He was...when he was born, it was Austria, as I mentioned before, but it became after the first world...world war, Polish territory. In 1933, I tried to go to the United States. I had relatives there, an uncle, brother of my mother, and cousins. It was...I did not get an answer so that means I could not get any papers and go here...go to the United States. So I decided in Germany I cannot stay and I went to Poland because my brother and sister lived there and they said there are three and a million Jews live. You can live too. When I came to Kolomier where my sister lived, was a city not far away from Rumania border, and there I could make a living because I needed a territory where there was industry. So I figured it out and I went to Katowice. For two reasons. First of all, there was the so-called Polish industry, and the other one was that I did not speak Polish and I could help myself with a lot of German and a little Polish. And I even went to an evening school to know a little bit more of the language. I made a living, but in 39 we heard, in May 39, that there will come probably a war between Germany and Poland. So I decided to get out of Poland. But, as I mentioned, before you couldn't go anywhere. I met a young man on the street and I told him we had to talk. And I told him I think we get...have to get out from here, somewhere. So he just said..uh...(clearing throat) well, you have a Polish passport, you cannot go anywhere. You have the will to go, but nobody lets you in. A few weeks later I joined the party on advice of friends and thev told me that thev will <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> routine and went to the Rumanian border and so we were reunited in Kolomier altogether the whole family once more except my father who was not anymore alive. Thirteen or 14 days later the Russians came in. And I remember so well because they came with tanks, slowly in, and every second tank did not function. A few days later we saw trains going day and night out of Poland with everything they could get...put their hands on and they were at that time making the Ribenthrow-Molotov Pact and felt obliged to give them food and assistance to lull everything that is..-uh...capitalist. Soon thereafter you had to stand for bread in line.</p><p>Everything was...you couldn't get. The businessmen were forced to sell everything they had for was declared as null. as..of no value. And when I looked at all these <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> were Jews that fled Poland from the other side where the Germans came and they took them prison...as prisoner anyhow if they didn't do anything either. Then 2 days later there was an other man with us who was Jewish. His name was Mesha. He was very friendly and we...he said...we asked him what are you here doing...doing here. He said, "I am a leather cutter and I stole a little bit of leather. He gave me 2 years." But he used to get packages. He used to be very friendly, and he heard what we talked and up to the time when Paris fell to the Germans that means somewhere in June or July...don't know exactly, we didn't know that people that are interrogators take nights out and I was not, as I told you before, I had a clear case what I am. A Zionist! They told me there were a lot of papers in different languages. He was very friendly...gave him cigarettes. in German. And...uh...looked to...looked to it that they should see that Paris was taken by the Germans. So he told them, "You see. Now the capitalist are gone. Now we will fight the fascist. That is our purpose." So he came back to the cells and I...L...I heard from anybody of them...from all of them the same...the same news.</p><p>And in August 1940 they took us all down in the former church of the Kiev prison and told us we will judge...be judged now and get the sentence. I was called and there were three men sitting there, not dressed very nicely. , proud of it and said in Russian language. May I say it in lanouage which I talk vou know? -- That means. <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> are put in a train. The train was not...uh...a car..uh...animal car, but it had grates and it was similar to the first class of prewar Germany. Hard seats and outside was both sides soldier with a gun, and we were transported through Russian Europe. To show it is nor so bad, we were in a train like humanbeings. But as soon as we atrived...as we reached the we <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> thev plaved Jewish sonos. Like ~ When we went out to work. we went over 1 and a <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> mention that because it was...at that time when I started to give a account, I had a home. I had a family. I had a mother, a brother, a sister, relatives. And all probably looked where I am, hungry and almost dying. My body was going. It was my soul. My knowledge of my religion, my education from Homburg that made me think I will survive, gave me hope. I used to cover myself and forget where I am and dreaming that today is holiday. The fourth Yom Kippur I was in a camp because Russia lost a lot of people at Stalingrad and in the war at all, and they started to empty out prisons...prison camps, especially those people that could not work. And they want them out maybe to replace the men that were killed. So I was sent to a camp. There I was told I cannot go out. He looked at me and he said in Russian language, " ." He is such a bird. They don't know what to do with." There is such an expression in Russian, . Such a bird! So I was sent back and a few days later I was called to the gate and I was told to go take my few things, less than I brought here today.</p><p>And there was a horse and wagon waiting and a woman was sitting on it. She's going to have a child. And I...and the...the man with the gun, ___, went with us to go to another camp.</p><p>Could see it from far away. It was a workers" camp. In contrast to this camp which was an assembly place for those they took eventually go out. I couldn't walk that far so I told him I cannot. I was sitting down in the snow. I cannot. So he told the woman to go up...down, and put me up because the horse could not pull that much. Such a horse wasn't fat either. We finally arrived after | and a half hours there and there I was taken to the office and in the office there was sitting a woman that...uh...told me, "Grandpa." And I looked at her because I had a beard and I walked with a cane which I bought for a piece of bread...that somebody made out of wood. And she said, "Take a look." I said, "I'm not a grandpa. I'm 39 years old, and I..." And she said, "Take a look at the mirror." And it was the first time in many years that I saw a mirror and I didn't recognize myself. Being friendly to me...she was a___, she was a prisoner too. She told me...uh...] told her, "I'm hungry. I didn't get anything to eat from the morning til now. It's afternoon." She said, "I cannot give you anything I don't have." And it was Christmastime, and nobody was there of the high ranking. And she said, "Evenings when they give everybody to eat again." So I had to wait. And I got the piece of bread and I went. before that I went to the _ 39 called hognital of the camn and told the doctor I <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> was rags was better than his, and he wanted me to exchange. But lucky enough towards evening...quite a bit of people came back from work and among them boys from Vienna.</p><p>Jewish boys from Vienna. Oh, I said...and I am bad on Germans and working there. This is a working camp and I will not go free. And that was very sad. But they had flour because they worked unloading flour and they brought flour with them. And they took water and flour and made it because our soup was watery. The spoon did not stand, but there the spoon stood.</p><p>And they gave me as much as I wanted of flour and water and with a spoon to eat. And I told them about what the others do to me and they went over and told them, "You are talking here to soldiers. You will get it." And they let me go. Let me go. They called me uncle. Was 20.</p><p>21 years boys that were expelled from Vienna. Children of...probably of parents that once were from Galicia and lived in Vienna and the children are born there and they were prisoners there. What happens to them I don't know. Anyhow, after a short while I was called back to the other camp. When I came to the other camp it was empty. Only a few people from...uh...which you see now on television from this..from those Republic that wants to be by themselves. They...we had there to sleep. The food was not good. Again a piece of bread and that soup. So I had no other way. I lived everyday in and out, but I didn't go to work. It was in February. It was Christmastime. It was in February. We didn't have the calendar. I cannot tell you exactly the date and it was very hard winter, of course there 40 below. And...uh...but one nice day, that is a nice day in 44, in March 44, I went somewhere. I went to the man of the kitchen, in charge and he was from White Russian, a Polish citizen from White Russia and he wanted to learn how to speak German. So he will give me a little bit of bread and soup. So I spent my time with him. As soon as he didn't cook I spent my time with him. When I came back to the barrack, "Where are you? Where have you been?" The __ looked for you. I said to him, "I'm free to go. I don't have to go...be where...I'm in the camp. I was in the camp." The ____ came back, called my name. Always that same way, "Waxim "Max. the son of Solomon. You goto freedom. I didn't believe it <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> So we came to the station quite a bit from the camp. There the window was closed and after a certain time she opened it up. There was...uh...uh...a station made of wood. Everything is wood there. They have nothing else, but wood. And it was, of course, cold. Worse than outside because the cold inside is usually worse when it's not heated. And she opened up.</p><p>She said, "Children." In Russian they talked that way. "The Biata...I have no tickets for you today. The train will come through in half an hour and they have no space on that train. The train from Blabiwostick to 20... went throuch there and we were soing - <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 0 uh...is here and he wants...and he wants to...uh...to...uh...make me to help him.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: We're back on camera. Now? Okay. Uh...Tell me...the butcher gave you food or did the butcher take you home? Tell me about the butcher.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: When we talk about the butcher, he had not a butcher's store. It was a booth with an open window and nights locked. You couldn't go into it. From the street, you showed your that means to prove that you are entitled to so and so much meat. And he gave it to you and he saw to it that he didn't give you everything to you was yours because he needed some for a black market so that he could exchange it. The...he took me home and he wanted to help me. All of a sudden, his Jewish heart came out. He wasn't an educated man, but his Jewish heart came out and he said, "Stop suffering." I did not know...I thought he...I said, "You went by one of the ____ and they were nice to you. You were a friend. I wasn't considered a friend." So he went with me to another Jewish place. The man was not married and he lived ina small __ there. I said, "All I can do....[ cannot sleep here. I can give him bread." And that was like giving you blood. Because it was rationed. And he gave me a big piece of bread. I had, as I told you before...uh... ____ called and there I put in with the piece of rag a big pocket. And needles we made ourselves. Got a piece of wire and yarn we got from other materials and I sewed a big pocket in and there I kept all the things that I hoped I will have when I...get...don't get anything I will not die from hunger. Of course, I couldn't eat anymore bread so I put the bread away. Then he continued...he needed from me where to go to sleep.</p><p>Outside was still 30 below, and it was end of May. So we went to a place. Her name was Sara. I never was her...know her name. And there was somebody living there by the name of Shiem, Shier. And her so called husband...don't know, Samuel...I don't know. Don't remember. She was...she had two rooms. One was like this window here where we are look on it, that you could look out and there was a big scale inside a scale...outside the scale and inside to read up how much it weighs. The farmers used to bring their product...delivered, that they had to deliver and she rated...and in the other room there slept. And he told her, "Sara, the man has to sleep somewhere. You know I cannot take him to me." She wouldn't give. But here he is among Jews...you understand, and she said, "When Shier comes home from work, she will talk to him. So I waited...he went home in the meantime and left me there...get rid of me, and then the others will take over. So when Shier came home he said, "No. We don't know you. You may have lice." They had the lice. I was deloused. When I went out I was deloused. So they had lice. And he cannot...no...and he gave and he gave me a piece of bread. It is blood and a drink. And they let me be on the hayloft. There I went up and I thought maybe the hay...when I go under the hay I will not...I will be not too cold. It will be not so bad. But after 2, 3, 4, 5 minutes I had to get up. Couldn't stand there. I started to exercise, do whatever I could and I was waiting because I went to bed 6 o'clock, got...got...got night there and... uh...in the morning...the nights were short. Came already towards June and there was already sometimes when it had only half a hour night. And I was waiting for the morning to see again the butcher. Shier came up before he went to work and he told me in Yiddish. " &gt; So T told him. "It's cold and I am almost frozen and so <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 2 half loaf of bread on the black market. It is not so much, but 2 and a half loaves of bread. I went to the butcher and I told him everything and he went...he brought me a hot soup. Not good, not that soup. It was bitter, bitter flour. I don't know what's in it...what it...what it was.</p><p>Probably a food that they give to animals but...uh...you cannot die from it. And I had...uh...the hot soup and the bread again and he was...he told me he made an arrangement with a Russian Jew who has chil...children that are...uh...manager of a cohorse. Cohoss is like the kibbutz. When he came and he start to talk to me, I went with him because he started from Kanaa and he wanted to know this and that. "Oh," he said, "Yal. Yal. Yal." And he showed me his wife is standing on the black market and sell things. They were fleeing the Germans, and he pretended that they always...that they took the last things with them and he sells it day after day so that they can live. But in fact, he was a black marketing. Things she bought, got and they lived. So he took me home and I got the first time after 4 and a half years of my life, I got a hot dinner. That means a piece of meat, a soup with beans and..and noodles. But sleeping he couldn't give me. He was tight, and they didn't know who I am from a concentration camp. Didn't know. And I had a beard and I walked with a cane. I didn't look like I look today. Came back and the man, the butcher went home and he couldn't do anything for me so I went to the railroad station. Because the railroad station you wait for a train and there is an oven. So I went there to sit down and warm myself until the next night goes through and then I had an appointment with a Ukrainian manager where the children said he should get in touch with me to go to the cohoss. There I had...there had a hat...I had to sleep and where to live. I was sitting there and fell asleep at the oven, at the belly oven because I didn't sleep the night before and I was always on my feet. I wonder today how I did it. And I was awake by...uh...by...uh... . And he said, "What are you doing here? Where is your papers?" Papers mean that everybody that was over those years had to have a passport.</p><p>So I had to have something to show who I am and why I am in this city. If I'm allowed in this city or in this village. You couldn't go from one city to one village without permission of the</p><p> ~ When he looked it..oh. he said. Parasranh 58. come on with me. And he took me to <span class="page-break" number="11"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 3 to give me 4 or 5 potatoes...I don't remember the details, 4 or 5 potatoes and a bowl of sauerkraut. So I waited because I will go with several other people, with their girl who had been to the marketplace, brought there something from the village to take home, salt, " and he told that one girl, "See to it that he goes there and there...there to this village," because she lived not far away. She didn't know if I was Jewish. She didn't know who I was.</p><p>She saw that I'm a grandpa. Good looking, strong, not educated girl. And she helped me to carry that little wooden case where I had nothing in. I...I...1 threw it away after that. (clearing throat) And when I came they were all sleeping because it took us a long time. They were all sleeping. She woke up. I gave her this little ticket. She gave me the potatoes. She gave the sauerkraut and in the farm house always benches along in Russia, where they sleep. They sleep on the oven and all on the benches all high up because the heat goes up. So I laid down and I couldn't...I couldn't get up anymore. I couldn't get up anymore because in walking so far, I had pains here, my bones. I think close to the...to the first of May. I made there a mistake. It was the first of May...it was the end of April and not May. I have got to correct that. I was...was right originally that it is...uh...it is the 27th of April and...uh...not May.</p><p>Uh...uh...I got...they were sitting down that day over meat, bread, soup and I didn't get anvthing. Uh...She told me in Russian. she told me _ "Whoever does not work <span class="page-break" number="12"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 4 Everybody has to work and I had to go to the field again. There I fell asleep and I had some potatoes already prepared to take home and somebody that checked on me told them about me. That would be 5 or 10 years again for doing that. She got me out of it...got me out it, and 1 left that hospital. And I did not work. I went on the black market again. But there was a bookkeeper that gave me at that time what I had to come for that work and she was a Jewish woman from Kiev. Her husband was...uh...State Attorney in Kiev and he was sentenced for 10 years by Stalin as not reliable. And she had a daughter living with her 8 or 9 years and never heard from her husband again. We became friendly. I visited her. So what I got more from her was an onion or a garlic and a little bit more bread and we had talks. In the meantime, I had company with that Mr. Becker who became after then the conservative rabbi of Memphis that gave me the...the money...that gave me the money. I met him at services. He made a Minyan in 1944 in September at Sara's place because she had an extra room. Now he prayed the Musaf service and I pray...I prayed the Shofer service. And at that place we were four people, all foreign Jews but one. It was a Russian Jews. He was...name was Matowich. He was in his high 70s. He fled Ukraine, and he had a prayer book. Didn't take anything this prayer book, the Moosberg. And from that we prayed and all the other said, yes...yes...harman or. When he heard me pray...Becker, he decided he wants to be more friendly to me, wants to know about me. He was afraid of anybody because he was...uh...every 3 months checked if he can go to the front line again because he came from Rovno which not far away from Limburg and there they took him into the army and they retreated and you know where he __ in 14 days the Germans were before Moscow. And all of those people there that army, they're taken to camps. Not concentration camps, but not transports. And every 3 months he was checked for his health and he played the crazy one.</p><p>So he could not tell me and he didn't have the con...I could be linked up with their men. He did not know. But then he got confidence in me. He told me that has ____ from the Yeshiva in __, and he was writing for The Moment in Warsaw and was a friend of Begin. Begin was retired the Youth Movment, and he wrote for The Moment _ articles. Now, he doesn't know about his family anymore and that was it. He is here. He became so friendly I told, "Why do you read the Russian paper. Learn English. One nice day we will be in Western Europe, the Western Hemisphere, and English will be it and not Russia." So the girl where I lived had a book, an English book, was a first 2 years used. And we talked. I forgot to tell you that a man...man by the name of Smiger, a photographer, helped me more than anybody else. The butcher told me, "Go to Smiger. Tell him who you are. I told him already that you are here." And he gave me, of course, something to eat. Bread and butter, and some fruit...fruit, had some fruit. He had...he was a photographer because, as I'd mentioned before, anybody after the age of 12 has to have a passport. So he was making these pictures for passports and had to give him for 5 rubles. But then...when you wanted more pictures, you had to give 50 or a hundred rubles and there where he has the money.

Can you see that the man there...we are a friend...write your name. There's room for both of us that we go on the same trip with her. She listened. The next day we came and she said, "You did me a very bad service. They wanted almost to kill me. To take someone with paragaraph 58 they had you...his papers, your papers there and...uh...want to smuggle him out from here?" So that was it. That was October 1945.

She was a teacher and a sergeant in the army. Very good looking and healthy, you know. And I did not know that she took an eye on me because she passed there. I...I did live in the room and she passed there and saw me. But during that time, there was a law given out that anybody that is...that care...has a right to be repatriated when he is married from wherever she comes, she can go with. So there was a young lady. I can say really a lady. Her husband was the transport minister in Estonia. And her father was a banker. And they were taken the first day when the Russians came in and they never saw them again, and her mother and herself and several children, they sent to Kotenish. When she heard that I speak German...you know, these Lithuanian, Estonia, and Latvia, there...uh...the language was German. And she made my acquaintance and she told me that she has a lot of money in banks in Western Europe. If take her out and get married to her, either we stay married if I want; otherwise...but she will help me with a lot in business as a businessman. So, of course, I denied it. I didn't want to go into perform a marriage. But was I myself considered myself very..very weakly patriation man.. I was always a question...question mark if 1 go back not to connect myself with another dark person. I can endanger and I don't come out again. So I told her I cannot do it. Finally, when we came to Keof, very happy I have my paper with me, and I have some rubles from the black market and I went to buy some cigarettes on the market and other things, and my paper was stolen. I got so frightened and I went to that woman from the office there. Said, "Your fault. You will stay here. What you think? I can make paper for you? Why do you go on the black market? Aren't you glad to get out from here?" And shouted at me and all that. So I was told have to go to the office where they lose and find and that was closed and after 4 o'clock it opened, and she didn't have anything and I had to bring...uh...uh...uh ...uh...little piece of paper that I was there. If she had no paper, so I went without the paper and I went back to her. Broken! Heart broken! 6 o'clock. And this is not just here, and there's a taxi or anything. All or a piece of bread. When you have to you have to. So she told me, "I'll tell you what. I go with you night to the __.</p><p>Maybe they give you another paper." I just called them and told them about.
