My name is Teofil Kosinski, Polish, but for Americans it may be a little difficult to pronounce, Kosinski, so it's better I say Toffi Kosinski.</p><p> I was born in Poland, in Torran. This is a Polish name, and in German it was Torran. I</p><p> was born on the first of January 1925, so in one month I will be 71 years old.</p><p>Q. Did you go to school also in Torran and what did your parents do?</p><p>A. I finished my ordinary school, seven classes, in Torran. My parents -- my father worked on the railroad and my mother worked from time to time cleaning some houses.</p><p> We were together five children and my mother and father. Until the war, until the first of February 1929, we were living in the railroad blocks. We had three rooms, but two rooms were rented always because the salary of my father was very low to feed the whole family.</p><p> Q. You speak also very well German. Why?</p><p>A. You see, in Torran were many German people. Even my parents had to go to the school, to German school so that before the war I learned a little German from German people, and just a little home because from time to time my parents if they wanted to speak in secrets before me they tried to speak in German.</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And do you understand what they were telling?</p><p>A. No, no, I couldn't. I was so angry. "Mamma, why you speak?" And she laughed and it was so funny, but then when Hitler came I had to try to speak and to learn because I knew that was very important for me.</p><p>Q. How were you raised -- in which religion were you raise A. I was catholic. I am catholic and that's all. I was educated in this religion. When I was going to the school -- we had also because in Torran were some Jews. I had two friends at my school but during the religion lesson they went out.</p><p>Q. Do you remember their names?</p><p>A. In Torran school not, but later I had some friends after the war that I met. Titlebaum.</p><p>He's now in Israel. He left Israel in 1968 probably he's still alive. Maybe when I will be in Israel I will find him. It will be a great pleasure for me.</p><p>Q. I don't know Torran at all. Can you describe how it looked during your childhood when you grew up and your family --?</p><p>A. Yes, I try. It was a wonderful time. It still is wonderful, very old city. Some people called this town . Itis from the old century, middle age city. A most gothic, beautiful old churches and the music house also very nice. This place, the Torran was the place born . It was very famous. You remember maybe or you know something <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> A. No, I noticed. In Torran, not very Jews but the Jews that are, are very kind and very good. Even we, we made shopping by company by . My father was, as I told you, a railroad worker, so if we like to buy something, some dressing, some clothing, we received from him especially . It was very convenient for us because cash to pay it was very <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> I gave it back to this tailor because I didn't use it and we couldn't pay. So, my further education was finished. Since the war it was absolutely forbidden for the Polish people to go to the school.</p><p>Q. Do you remember the day in 1939? Can you tell us exactly?</p><p>A. Of course, I remember very well. It was on the third of September, morning --no it was on the first of September. I was in the market. Usually I went very early before going to the school, and I helped some German farmers to put vegetables on the market. They paid me also with some vegetables and it was very hard for my mother. I returned home. We heard the signals and my mother said, "Oh my God, the war began." She has seen -- many people had seen a cross on the sky oral like this because my mother spent the first war, she had the experience and she said, "No, never in our life a second war." But the second war began.</p><p> And then, on the third of September, it was Sunday, I'll never forget it. My father has to go to Warsaw to fight against the Germans. He has received three months salary. He left his money to my mother. My mother took the money. She took special -- not in paper money only in coins, use silver because she said she had experience. Paper money would not be valid. The coins will be valid, just silver.</p><p> So, the third of September, from our family from village they came with the horse and how we call it this car -- with horse, and they took us from the village because everybody afraid that they will come, the bombs will come, and we want to be hidden there so that we went to the village with our family with our family to be more surely there than in the city of Torran.</p><p> Q. Did you return to Torran?</p><p> A. Not so early. First me, brother, everybody, we were there and the village but maybe after</p><p> two weeks after we heard that in Torran are the German soldiers, my mother asked me and my</p><p> older brother has to go to this house and try to prove that everything is okay because during the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

We had returned. We seen soldiers, some soldiers in the beginning were very kind. They tried to give soups and breads because in the soups we had nothing. I took some breads even and I went by foot with my brother to the village and I told mother, "Come on. There is no reason to sit here. We must go home. The soldiers are not so bad. Maybe the war will be not so long." And we returned to the same place to the nice house where we lived before.</p><p>Q. Did you stay in this house during the war?</p><p>A. Oh, only maybe two months we were living there in the same house, but then once they came there, the soldiers, by some patrol, I couldn't recall because I was very young, and said you must leave this house. Oh my mother began to cry but where are we to go. We are living so long here. Don't make a . You must leave. We are giving you a few hours time but <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> A. The only reason was that we are Polish. This was the reason. It was too nice to us. They put it immediately German families from Germany. Sometime, because we were living in -- across sometimes we look out the window. It was very difficult to just living here and the people from Germany took our flat.</p><p>Q. How did you support yourself and how did the family support themselves in the following months?</p><p>A. Usually all young people were sent to the force camp to Germany. My brother -- before the war was one or two years he learned not as baker for some sweet things, but baker and so he worked by this baker and once he came to me he said you see, it's better you take the job by</p><p> . It is also baker and I have some friends there. It will be very good job and <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> A. [heard this immediately. It was written, we had many times some special how you call this on the streets, there was written, at the first in the beginning it was written in German and in Polish . I don't know in English how it was. I went to the school but the door was closed and it was only for German children. I knew immediately I couldn't go.</p><p>Q. Were you disappointed?</p><p>A. Of course because I was so glad I started to study. I wanted to be as we called in Poland, even in Torran, one mensch. My mother, my father said I will take from a month and put to him for his schooling, one of our family must be a mensch. I think in comparing with other people, it was maybe in the beginning not so bad for us because as I told you I was working as a delivery boy for a baker. So, I could receive even for my payment, my salary was not so high. I remember it was only five marks per week, but I received some bread and it was very important because the food was rationed especially for Polish people. We had received -- what I remember, there was one pound of meat per month including bones. You can understand it was nothing. It was with some soldiers also. Sometimes we wondered she prepared some dishes, of course meat was maybe two or once per month, but she prepared this or that so things that my mama, she was very practical and we were not hungry. In the beginning I thought and my brother bought so that our family didn't be hungry.</p><p>Q. You said there were Polish people from Torran sent from Germany. Do you remember stories, do you know people who were sent to Germany for forced labor?</p><p>A. Oh, yes. Even my friends from the school they were sent to . For <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> , how very hard, and very -- they had here a -- Polish, this is in Poland and he wrote me so that I could read the conditions were very, very hard. So, therefore I tried to do my best only to stay to work for this baker instead to go there, to Germany.</p><p>Q. Did he write you where he was -- was he kind of imprisoned in a work camp or did he work for --?</p><p>A. That was forced labor, . He was sent, many Polish people were sent. Some of Polish families were sent to this . It's called because we were born in Torran.</p><p>Who was born in Torran the Germans they kept them there, but who wasn't born there, they sent to the district . Maybe it was better. We would like also to go there, but we <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> A. Yes, I tell you. When I was fourteen years old I worked for this baker, and I worked, let's see, 1941, I worked there. But it was so that during the war for young people, no chance, life was so boring we couldn't go -- there was cinema but for German people only. There was the arts but for German people only. We had nothing. We had to stay home from eight o'clock evening until six o'clock in the morning. It was how we call curfew. You couldn't walk. You can't imagine. It is summer, a very nice time. Evening it's dark first at 10:00 and you have to be home. What we have done. There was a small place, we took our chairs, from all people, we were sitting there to spend in the fresh air because we couldn't go on the street. One time when I was delivering the bread to the hospital, I pass, always the theater. I was very keen for theater because I like very much music. I like to sing, even in the school. And then I have seen there was written "Chorus singers wanted." I think "Oh my God, maybe I could go there." First I wonder and ask was me as a Polish can I do it. They look at me because I'm very young. I was 16 years old and first he said, "You want to be singer? You still have this mutation, this change of voice." I said, "No, no, I finish my mutation. I would like to sing." Okay. We employ also Poles, but the examination will be at this and this time. I asked to write to fill my name and after two days I went there. I remember Mr. Veber, not so old, but a very good man and he gave the examination, first on the piano and then he asked me sing something. German songs I didn't know and I asked, "May I sing Polish?" "Yes. You can do this." I never forget I sang a very nice Polish old song. He liked it. It was very nice. I translate it soon as I could and he said to me, "Go away, wait." I don't know. Maybe he asked somebody. Maybe the commission makes some discussion. Anyhow, after one hour he said okay, you will be our chorus singer. Your voice is correct, very good, only the question you must work here only as an extra task. It will not be main work. I didn't understand what he meant. You will work afternoon and evening and</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0 the other job you have you must keep it. Okay, I agreed. I went home. I said to my mother, my mother, oh, it will be too difficult for you, two jobs. And maybe the will not be <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 1 there will some blackmail. The man will be know about her and okay. I was looking for a new job. It was very, very difficult to find a very easy job. But I found it as an ordinary worker. It is in German a . You can translate this into English. I remember the name it <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 2 A. Yes, of course I had to because we had the exercises. We received a note and it was German. I tried to learn the German better. I asked my mother, my father, the grammar. My mother could speak but she couldn't explain me how it was grammatically good. Then I asked sometimes Mr. Veber and he was very glad that I am so keen for this language. He said, "Oh, you are a very clever boy. Ina short time you will speak fluently German." It was not fluently but it was better and better, always better. So, that's and even when I was working with this baker, we went together and we made shopping with the women, with the meister and I tried also to speak German or Polish. She said we are going now to the German shop, try to speak German only. And sometimes if I needed something, , then because we couldn't buy, except a small ration of food in the cart, nothing, no . The Germans had some <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 3 A. Yes. It was once when I left the theater I crossed usually the same place to make some shopping and I feel that somebody watched me. At the moment I thought maybe some policeman because it was dark. I didn't see. I went and he followed me and they see there is some uniform, some soldier. I didn't know what he wanted from me. He watched, but his watching was completely differently than usual. He smiled to me. It never happened before and he started to ask something of me and he said , which means "this is a nice <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 4 station. It was in the railroad station in the middle of the city. It was a very good place. Okay, but when? You see I don't know when I'll receive the permission for going out because he was a soldier. And I also, I don't know because there were differently plays, operetta, gypsy, a little longer, sometimes it is an operetta it was a little shorter. We fixed exactly I <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 5 of course, I was young, I feel it. But and we had no possibilities but it was a very, very pleasurable time. We couldn't see each day as I told you because he could not receive every day the permission but so long he could he came and he brought me always something, some sweet, some special ration card. With this card I could buy some pastry because for Polish people it was absolutely forbidden to receive pastry but for his card especially evening when I went, I could receive it. I received once even shoes because he had seen that my shoes for the winter time was no good. Home was big scandal, especially my brother.</p><p> My brother felt that there is something wrong because I brought shoes. I brought once shirt, inside shirt and he knew that this shirt was from soldier. He asked me something, "What's happened? Don't worry. What I am doing is my business." Sometimes he was very angry. He said I am older than you. I promise Father to take care of you so I must know.</p><p> Q. Did you tell him?</p><p> A. Not early. Later. When that was so big that even my mother feel something happened with me, something, because I ask very often, "Mother I need white shirt.". My mother complained, "I have no soap. You change every day. I cannot wash. Mother I must look very nice", but it was not for theater. It was for my friend. His name was Willie Goetz. I will never forget his name.</p><p> Because he was so sweet to me, I wanted also to be sweet and once they of course, when my brother drank a little, schnapps, that's a kind of illegal vodka, we couldn't buy it but he had some contacts. Maybe later I will tell you. I knew he had to work. He worked with some underground. I never knew exactly, but he brought also sometimes schnapps probably from these places.</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. <span class="page-break" number="11"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 6 I said to him, his name was Casimir, I said, "Cashic, you must understand me. I fall in</p><p> love with soldier. Oh my God, why? You don't like women? No, I like men like you like women. | like men. You must understand me. No, this is only for the moment. You'll find a girl probably, especially with Germany. You know what's happened. It's very dangerous. No, it's not dangerous, it's so good. No, you can be sure. You must stop this. I'll tell mother. Don't tell this mother, I ask you very much. Don't do this." He didn't say this, but from this time he changed his behavior towards me. And our relation was not so open. I knew that sometimes he went to somebody but not night only during the day. He had no permission so that his time working and doing this was not so easy for him. Anyhow, our relation was not so good as before.</p><p>Q. You said that your brother worked in the underground, did you ever get into difficulties with that?</p><p>A. I feel it. He never said this at home but there are too many friends and they came to our room, with no loud speaking. Even my mother, "What are you doing? This is our business." SO, that I feel there was something there. They had some news about the war, about the front, from where? We had no radio. I forgot to tell you that when we were living in this nice house we had very nice radio, Phillips Radio. We didn't even pay. There was two years of payment and the Germans in the beginning immediately took this radio so that the Polish people never listened to no radio. For my brother I had some news because from BBC they heard something.</p><p>It was only my feeling, but I suppose he was afraid that I was working in the theater with German people. And then I said to him I have this friend, this soldier, I'm sure that he didn't want to tell me about his underground work.</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Did you -- how was your feeling that Willie was Austrian, I mean he was part of the German army and the German army was responsible that you couldn't go to school, that you had to work. How did you feel about that?</p><p>A. Usually my feeling to German soldiers was very bad because in the school we were educated against Germany and Russia. Even my mother sometimes when I wouldn't go to the church, she called me a Bolshevik. That was the worst thing. When I met Willie and he said to me he is Austrian, my feeling was completely different because I felt he's not German and his behavior was so good. I thought maybe when I said to my brother that he will understand me, but he didn't because he said for me German uniform is German uniform. It's Austria or it's not Austria but it is for me German. And he knew that I couldn't go to the school. Very often he made me plans, you see the world, it will not be war time. The war will finish. Maybe you'll come to my country. You will study there, you will be a real mensch. Be a waiting person, do like just now. Be in this way as you are because I was very honest.</p><p> In our family and my mother was very strong, strong for the education. I never forget once before the war I went not to the school I went -- instead to school with boys to some play and because I was always going to the school, the teacher sent somebody to ask what happened to me why I didn't come to the school. My mother knew this. I came home as usual. It was ereetings. I said . My mother said I give you forever and I received -- I was <span class="page-break" number="13"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 8 to work morning from one work to another work. I even had not enough for sleeping, only when I had no appointments with him I could sleep a little longer.</p><p>Q. How old was Willie?</p><p>A. He was maybe five or six years older than me, but he looks very handsome, very strong.</p><p>I never seen his picture and he told me -- I asked once for his picture but he said it's better you will not have it. It will be very dangerous for you and for me. He told me also. He said something, you must be very careful because Hitler, what you receive for this kind of love is very dangerous. You must be very careful. I said what for we are doing nothing. Don't tell anybody that we meet or that we are coming here. It would be very dangerous. He told me one day he said "You know Hitler is also for men. He likes only this kind of love. Really? Yes, he's not married. He is single and he likes this kind of love. The Fuhrer then why are you so anxious? Please believe me, I am older I know better." He told me that.</p><p>Q. Did he tell anything about the persecution of homosexual men?</p><p>A. No, it was only the attention given to me in this way, but it was in a real 1941 when we met, let's go to a place here, I cannot tell you. He brought me something new and he was very nervous. What's happen? At first I thought maybe someone has seen us. I asked him, no, nobody seen you know. I'm sent to the eastern front of war. Oh my to Russia. | heard that this was the worst front in the war because it was warmer it was snow. You must wait for me. I promise you. The war will not be longer. When the war is end the war you will come to Vienna.</p><p>I will try to live with you together. Wait forme. But how will I contact. I'll write you. I gave him my address and I was waiting for his letter but I hadn't received it. I was very sorry, very sad. Even my mother, my brother. I said to my brother that my friend went -- he accepted, he agreed. He was a little satisfied with this. He was more calmly that something happened wrong</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. <span class="page-break" number="14"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 9 to me. I was waiting for this letter. Once I couldn't remember -- I have to state to you also that in my theater there was working like me. He was a little older. He knew exactly, he learned me this way, he explained me this kind of love and he asked me -- first I didn't want to tell him but I wanted to see the place, what's happened. Where is this shed and then come on let's go. We shall go maybe there and once we went there it was after the performance and when we went there, voices. Some people -- I wanted to run away. He too, and especially one fellow took us here very quickly, halted the mouths. We couldn't cry, nothing and then in broken German he said to me that he's from the concentration camp Studthoff. He was a very young Jew. Bascal I remember this name. We give our story to him to the other people. We talk to them also. One spoke very good Polish. He was Polish. That Sigmund, the other boy took the Jew -- I couldn't take where we were living. He took him home probably for some feeding even some dressing.</p><p>What's happened there I don't know exactly. I was only with my things about my friend. Even Sigmund if I wanted to know, he told me only it was very nice time. I can imagine. Maybe he used him for some sex or something like this because he said it was so nice.</p><p>Q. How many men were in this shed?</p><p>A. Three men. Some of them they had stripes, some trousers. Maybe they found them, but they had stripes. They couldn't go on the street. They would be immediately arrested.</p><p>Everybody could recognize them. They had this cap also with this thread. Now I know that they had some but I don't remember exactly. I knew only the faces very --- Bascal was small, <span class="page-break" number="15"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 0 had seen a German newspaper and this German newspaper on the table and there was written, there was the address for the soldiers who are on the east front. I wrote secretly this and then I was fighting with myself. It was so long time, four months. I haven't received a letter. Have I to write or not to write the letter.</p><p>End of Tape 1</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

When you went to this shed and you heard voices, what exactly happened?</p><p>A. You see, when we went there there was change. Usually I remember it that it was completely different. We heard some voices, some human voices and when I said to my friend, Sigmund, let's go, we go, at this moment somebody stood up and closed our mouths, nothing to say. Probably this man thought we are from Poland or maybe some spies. Then he started to ask me Polish. He spoke very good Polish. "What are you doing here?" he asked me. We came only here because our paths crossed. We are not from -- no we are Polish. He tested me many times. He feels that I speak perfect Polish. My friend also, and then we have seen two other faces. They were laying the sheets and the youngest was trembling, was very cold even the outside was not so cold. And the youngest tried to speak something. I asked in Polish first, but he couldn't reply me Polish and he said to me in German. I asked "Are you German? No, ina completely different way, in French. I'm French and Jew." He said Bascal's his name. My friend Sigmund took care of him immediately. I gave him shirt because he had only his striped jacket.</p><p>This from the Studtkoff. It is warm outside I can go home in my white underwear shirt. And so I did. Then he said to this Bascal that he will take him home but only in this dressing. Then to the two, he promised to wait here so long as they will come. The French with the Bascal probably he wanted also to bring some food, maybe some dressing. I don't know exactly. I had enough problems with my Willie and I couldn't help nothing more. I give only my shirt and that is all.</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

He said everything is okay. Bascal was at his house, slept there, and he didn't want me to say more. I can imagine he helped them. He gave maybe food some dressing and they escaped from this place to maybe another place. I never went more. I was also afraid that if I go there and there are some prisoners because they said they are from Studtkoff. It was for me also very dangerous to go there. So, that I didn't go anymore there.</p><p> Only this I knew from Sigmund can be sure everything is okay. You can be sure don't ask more. I was wondering a little. Usually he was a little crazy, not crazy, but so funny and at this moment he was very, very serious and I proceeded very much. Unfortunately he is also not alive. I have met him maybe even ten years ago when I was in Torran but no more. He's also dead. He's no more alive. If he were we could go -- I would like to ask him even for this address of my friend as I told you Titlebaum. I tried to find his address. I wrote to my friend to</p><p> in the South of Poland but for Sigmund I have no chance because he is no more <span class="page-break" number="18"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 3 A. No, I don't know. Maybe not all. In Torran there were not so many, but near of Torran there was Alexandrov and there were many Jews. Even immediately in the beginning of the war when I didn't work by baker, it was not so far so I went by foot to Alexandrov to buy some bread. I remember that the Jews had to wear their David stars and they had to go on the street, and probably from Alexandrov they were sent to Studtkoff.</p><p>Q. And Polish people from Torran, do you know any Polish people?</p><p>A. Who were sent? No. At the moment I don't know. I cannot remember.</p><p>Q. But there was talk in Torran what happened in Studtkoff?</p><p>A. Oh, yes, yes, you know among the people there was talking of course that the situation was very bad. The food and the hell, --as all the concentration camps, but exactly as you know, maybe you remember about my life, later then I was arrested and my knowledge about the situation of Polish people, Polish Jews in Torran was broken.</p><p>Q. Why were you arrested?</p><p>A. As I told you when I found the address in the in the German newspaper, I wrote secretly the address and then I was fighting with myself whether to write to Willie or not to write.</p><p>Q. Which address did you find?</p><p>A. I find it . It was for the soldiers who were sent to the eastern front <span class="page-break" number="19"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 4 give me some news because I am so anxious about you. I cannot sleep. I cannot work and at the end, with may kisses your friend Teo. I wrote.</p><p> And it was a little naive to write especially I put my sender. Usually I couldn't do that but I was fighting if I send without sender what will happen. Maybe the letter will not come back. And if come back I will know that he is not there. So, I send the letter with my sender.</p><p>(section in bold has been copychecked; get most updated version from Joan. 9/10/96)</p><p> Q. And what happened then?</p><p> A. After sending I was still waiting. I was waiting for a reply, but the reply didn't come, never. Once it was September 19, 1942, I was working morning at this manufacture and the boss called me and told me that I'm invited to the gestapo. I have to go to the gestapo. I asked him, me to the gestapo? What for? I was so honest. I do nothing, what for do I have to go. He said please go there. We have received the order that you will go there.</p><p> Usually I took a bag with some sandwiches to the work. My mother prepared me the sandwiches and I left this bag with sandwiches at this manufactory but he said take this with you. Maybe you don't come back. Oh, why not? If I come back I will have nothing.</p><p>No, I didn't take, and when I went to the gestapo I remember this uniform, this black uniform with red here on the arm. He asked me first for the name. I told him that and then he took a typewrite. He started to write. He write I sitting also in front of him when the paper came down. I read from other side and I never forget the words it was written Lu " In English it is "Order for prisoner." The first moment I thought I <span class="page-break" number="20"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 5 cellar. To the cell and there was the furnace was only a wooden bed and a toilet and that's all. Even the door was scraped with wooden so I could put the handle like this. And I had to wait. The whole time I was sitting the night and I think what happened. What for, and the next day when I was called again to him, he showed me the letter. This letter which I wrote to Willie. Is this your letter? I was very honest. I said of course. This is my letter. I wrote this to him. You, you wrote this letter to a German. You loved him. I wrote him it was very good, yes. Then he said where did you meet him. He wanted to know exactly where we met at, what we had done, in which way. We seen only once or twice. I lied, I tried to lie but you say me and he showed me some pictures, other pictures of soldiers, not only soldiers, civilians. He wanted to know you cannot remember. You will remember.</p><p>with trousers to beat especially with the . It was terrible and I cried. They put it in my trousers and they beat me when I couldn't breath, I couldn't speak they brought water and poured water on me and began once more again and again.</p><p>All over, and always I heard only them, "You pig, you " So many bad words I cannot translate it into English especially in German.</p><p>Q. Say it in German.</p><p>A. In German . Terrible, so many words I hadn't <span class="page-break" number="21"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 6 what. I was so tortured. For me it was everything I signed only to be free.</p><p> , when you tell us the truth you'll be free. I was so stupid. I told them also about Hitler, what Willie said, that Hitler is also homosexual. He wrote this. Yes, and you the Fuhrer. It was very, -- now I'm smiling but it was not for smiling. It was for crying.</p><p> It happened so after two weeks as I told you I signed this what they wrote. I don't know.</p><p>Then they took me by special closed car. It was a kind, we call this like a &gt;&gt; which means you don't see nothing there, like in prison. When they brought me I had seen the round prison. I know because my brother immediately after the war, he was by the Germans also arrested by Germans but for very short time. Only reason was that he as a boy when he was going to the school -- it was not high school it was for the baker school, when he was going there, he has to train as a soldier, a Polish soldier. For this reason he was in the same prison. I never forget how my mother suffered. Sometimes she give me bread to give him and then I had seen she cried and she said "Oh my dear God it's better you take him." I had seen how the mother suffered if the son is arrested. Later when I was arrested I thought also that maybe she suffered also. He was only one month and she suffered and when I was so long time, but maybe we should go with my story further.</p><p> I was brought to this round prison. I was put in the cell with six or seven crime prisoners usually. When they heard because each prisoner had received a special card. I had received card. It was written paragraph 175. I didn't know what this mean paragraph and I showed it to everybody, but there was somebody oh it is for the gays, for the homosexuals. <span class="page-break" number="22"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 7 table when the meal began. They treated me very, very bad. And I was sitting there until fifth of December 1942.</p><p> On the fifth of December 1942 somebody opened the door. The block meister took me to the Judge. I remember there was only my mother, no people and me and maybe five or six in black dresses. They were the judges. There was shouting and cried, I have to be isolated. I have demoralized the German military, me Pollock and how could I do that. I must be punished. I must be punished for long time and I was 17 years old. They punished me for five years exactly</p><p> . I don't know exactly how it's called in German but is a very hard prison.</p><p> Immediately then I met my mother. I couldn't speak. You can imagine how was the feeling my mother and me. When I came to the cell first I cried. But later I had to go -- I was sent to Koronovo. was not far from maybe 50 or 60 kilometers. It was the worst prison in Poland before the war and during the war. Only for Polish and Jewish prisoners.</p><p> I will never forget they cut my hair because in Torran I still had my own hair. They gave me with some maybe yellow -- I don't know, it was here on the arm, and I was sent to the cellar with about 40 prisoners. There were maybe about five or six Jews together with me and it was terrible. My memories, especially in this cellar because the oldest of this cell it was a prisoner for a long life, murder and there was a clan. Around him he had a few prisoners. They made everything for him what he liked. We had nothing to say. We had to be polite what he -- even with the toilet. The toilet was only morning and then the food, when they delivered the food it was very small, but even if we received one spoon of marmalade, he took from us. We were given a little margarine, once or twice per week, he took also. So, that this time this is my worst time in my life. And then my leg began to be I have received a kind of I <span class="page-break" number="23"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 8 cannot explain in English. Due to the reason I had no vitamins. It was like it was spoiled this leg. It started from a small wound. This was this leg. From this to this here, this place.</p><p>Nothing, in those terrible times but of course everywhere is bad times and after bad will come a little better. Even there, there was so that because our work we were living, we were working in the same cell. There was very stupid work but very dangerous, very dusty. We had to the ropes, we could resolve the ropes then we had to make the leather for the new shoes for the front they were sent. This was the job and once they looked they wanted one . Oh, I have to explain also here that here we could write the letters once every two or three months home in German language. Everybody doesn't write German. Me and especially my good friend, it was the Applebaum, exactly I remember, he wrote also German. Some of them gave us one potato or two potatoes for the writing. At the first moment I didn't want to take but Applebaum said yes take it. It is for them also very helpful when they have the contact with the parents or with family your letters.</p><p> And so we cooperated very good in this way and once happen that block meister came to our cell and asked the oldest men for somebody who can write and speak German. First he send someone from his clan but after a few minutes he came back and he said no. Exactly he said</p><p> . Then when he came one more, "You have nobody here? Among 40 men you have nobody. I need a writer. I was standing and I said -- usually I couldn't do that and I think maybe I will be able for him. I said "Her block meister, I can speak German and I write German too." He was wondering I was so slim and young, where I could speak English. And he took me to his room. He gave me paper pencil and dictated. He dictated in German. I remember it was an office, exactly as you like I can do this in German, . He looked at this, yes, good. Go there. Take your clothes and <span class="page-break" number="24"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 9 you'll come here. I went to the cell and I remember everybody especially those of the clan but my friends, they said, really, he agree. You are able to take -- he takes you? Oh that's very good.</p><p>Go boy, with his hand and with this you are also good that God helps you.</p><p> When I went there it was a three men cell, much better, near the kitchen. Sometimes when I had a little more -- I received sometimes cigarettes. Cigarettes were very good like money for exchange. Because I didn't smoke -- I never smoked, I could make the exchange for the prisoners in the kitchen for cigarette I received some bread. Then I had the permit to go to other places. I belonged to the high society of this prison. I received better uniform, prison uniform, better warmer. Even the hair was a little longer than usual. As the flour sometime one had no water and me I was -- but I never forget about my friend Applebaum. I went and took with me some bread some food and I went to the cell and I wanted to give him this. Then I remember, I don't know exactly the name of him, he said since few days there's no more Applebaum. He patted -- he was in so high depression. He was ill. He had diarrhea and it was very, very dangerous. You know if somebody had this they couldn't stop and suffered. I suppose he thought that this is the end and he made this.</p><p> Of course I left his bread there. I came -- and that was not all because every week from Koronovo where the transport station to Sauxenhausen. So always thinking about it was one day I will also be sent there. Because that was the end of their life. Who was sent to Sauxenhausen never returned.</p><p> Q. Tell us a little bit more about --?</p><p>A. He was older than me. He was maybe forty, maybe, older than me. He was black, black hair. He spoke very good Polish. He told me that he lived in Lodz, this German city for</p><p> . He had family, but he never didn't want to say me what the reason was that he <span class="page-break" number="25"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 0 was in Koronovo. I thought maybe he was arrested before the war. I don't know, maybe political, I never knew. Usually later you received a card what was the reason of the prison. But this we haven't therefore I never knew. I never heard about this. His behavior, he said to me, boy don't be worried. You are very young. You will succeed. The war will be not long. You can be sure. He should be older because he told me also about first war. Maybe he knew this before. He was so sure that -- because I lost my hope. I thought maybe that Germany -- because always the Germans said Poland is forever forgotten, forever. And I lost my hope, but he gave me this trust in the prison.</p><p>Q. Was he Jewish?</p><p>A. Of course. You see I have to state, even in this prison, you knew immediately who was Polish who was Jewish. The David's star, they had this, this Applebaum. Therefore we knew, we Polish had only a number or maybe yellow on here, this stripe around.</p><p>Q. What was this yellow mean?</p><p>A. I don't know what this yellow means. It was prisoners, not like pink or no -- the differences of color when I was sent as a writer I received green. Before I don't know exactly the differences of color.</p><p>Q. Did people in the prison know that you were sentenced because of 175?</p><p>A. Yes, Applebaum knew. I told him, before I never hear this word homosexuality. I told him only that I had something with a man. I told him also with a German soldier. He wasn't astonished, only he smile, oh you are a young boy. It was stupid. You are still healthy. But my leg, you see, the war will not be so long. He told me always in this way.</p><p>Q. Were there other prisoners who were imprisoned because they were homosexual?</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. <span class="page-break" number="26"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 1 A. You see there were of course many, but some of them like the doctor for instance. He was working as a doctor because we had lazaret. It was for the very ill people, but there was no medicine, nothing. But there were some. When I was in the high position I met also another writer. I met also someone from theater, not from Torran, from other places. He was also for the homosexual. Then because we receive, everybody has a card and there was written for me for instance was written at this time not paragraph 75, only . Idon't know how to translate this into English. I don't know. It is like because I have just now this year I received a document thanks to the red cross and I have even with me this document and there was written</p><p> . Llooked at a dictionary. It's terrible. It is in the Polish language, <span class="page-break" number="27"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 2 what it means, homosexual, gay etc. but me I was really very shy boy and I didn't know this. I didn't talk about this and nobody asked, so that I never talked about homosexuals in the prison.</p><p>Q. Did you understand when during the interrogation, in the prison when the guard showed you the pictures of the other men, did you understand why -- what were you supposed to do with those pictures?</p><p>A. You mean after the war?</p><p>Q. No, you said in the beginning.</p><p>A. In the beginning when I met Willie --.</p><p>Q. No, no when you were arrested.</p><p>A. I think maybe they wanted to know that I had maybe more soldiers, not only one. This was the reason. Before they showed me some soldiers and civilians but I hadn't. I had only Willie. It was true, but they beat me. They wanted to know and maybe they should kill me because they didn't believe me. But maybe after two weeks they couldn't receive nothing more and they believed and I signed something. What, I don't know. After the war, especially later when I was a tailor then I tried to find the documents so I wrote to Red Cross, everywhere. I wanted to receive my documents. See, maybe I will tell you something. When I was a tailor and then when I was ill I didn't receive any indemnification for my time for prison. Then I think I have to do something, I must write to anybody and to fight for my rights. I spent as a boy for nothing so I suffered and my leg was -- my body was burned, and I want to call. First I wrote to ask for the indemnification. I explained that I was so long time the whole time in the prison for this reason and I would like to receive something, some compensation especially because I had to go early as a tailor. I couldn't work. I was ill for this reason and I had skin cancer and different illnesses, but I have received a reply very kindly that the money has been sent to Polish</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. <span class="page-break" number="28"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 3 government. I have to go to them and ask and they have to give me. But it was the communist government. They will never give money. Then I wrote once more that maybe some symbolic one mark only that I will have this satisfaction that he agree with me and I ask you for forgiveness. No, I received letter if I try more to write all letters will go to the paperbasket. I was so angry. Then I write once more. I will fight so long I will write to New York to the United Nations. I will fight for my rights. I black mailed a little because I knew I couldn't do that. Then what I have to do, then I find an address in Germany in the parliament there was homosexual bond organization. I wrote to them. I explained that I was so young. I suffered. I have paid with my life. My mother suffered and my family, and they explained we agree with you. We are very sorry, but really what we can do, we can only collect money for you for your research medicine. And I said no, I don't think you -- I don't need money. I want to receive indemnification. You must do something for me.</p><p>Then in Poland there was martial law, you remember and I said oh no, I cannot stay here.</p><p>I must do something, and one day I received a very nice letter from Germany. A young writer wrote me a letter and he put this letter in a book about young Jews in Israel. He wanted to give me with this book a sample of his writing, how he writes, his style of the book. And it was written in this letter that he found it by this organization a homosexual by Mr. 5 <span class="page-break" number="29"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 4 sent me again, so about six months we wrote. He wanted some pictures. He wanted to know some details and when this project of this book was finished he came to me, to Warsaw. I gave him the signature and the book was printed in Germany. The reaction of this book was fantastic.</p><p>I never believed, especially the young people. They wrote letters and they asked me, maybe I need something. They wanted to help me and they were saying -- I suffered only the reason was I love somebody, that I loved a man. It was very touching for me. Even until now I have contact with some of them, especially one doctor who delivers me always there the medicine and they contact -- they visit me. They come to me. I stay up to now with very good many friends and the name of this book is "Damned Strong Love" and in German . I paid really <span class="page-break" number="30"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 5 By American I learned how it is good because I was working in the canteen, I'm asking an officer. I'll never forget the nice apples, red, the conflicts and even I remember some words I learned, very funny like "hubba hubba" and it was really -- I had some friends and I met also one officer. He wanted to adopt me. He wanted you must come to America. I dreamed about America. I wanted to come here to America but he said you must receive the permission from your parents because they are alive. I received once the letter from my mother and my father came back. He was also in the forced labor camp in Germany and especially my mother asked me so much, come boy, back. Come on, it is not very good but we will be together. And I was fighting with myself. I didn't know what have to do, to go or not to go. Many friends said don't go, but my soul says, "Better go" and I went of course.</p><p> When I returned I regretted it because it was everything strange. Even when I went to this bath house where we were sent from Germany I didn't recognize my young brother. I remember he came and I said to my mother, "Mother a boy came." She said, "This is your brother." I cried but I couldn't go to Munich. I had to stay in Poland.</p><p>Q. Let's go back to the prison. You told us you were transferred to a small cell with three beds. It was a better situation. Did you stay in this prison?</p><p>A. No, no. Later, in the beginning I didn't know, but when the transport to Sauxenhausen the block meister came also to me and said you'll go to Stum. You must go -- no he didn't sent me to Stum only e took me to same transport. Me and some many four or five prisoners. They gave us you know how the hand -- and we went by and we went in special truck. Then on the way I heard Stum. Also, it is . In Stum, because my leg was so bad they <span class="page-break" number="31"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 6 months, when the control always was there. Once he said, "Oh, you are too long. It is not sanitary, you must go out." I know why because the front of Russia was near and near and they wanted that we do something. It was very hard work. It was very wrong because once I was in a one man cell and we had always this card and it was written , what, I was <span class="page-break" number="31"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 7 . Iremember near Linnenberg. Then they send me to Birken Belsen but it was <span class="page-break" number="31"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 8 Tape 3</p><p> Can you tell us again, when you left the Koronovo prison and where did you go to?</p><p>A. Yes. As I told you a few prisoners were sent to some places at the beginning we didn't know exactly where we are sending. The first moment I thought maybe we are sent to Sauxenhausen, but usually the transport to Sauxenhausen were much bigger. At this moment, a few only went. Then we had seen some other prisoners, a new one and we heard that it's Stum.</p><p>Stum, special for young prisoners. Young 25, 26, but not so many older. And immediately after arriving there, they had seen that I couldn't walk. They had seen my leg and they sent me to Lazaret. I was in the Lazaret with other prisoners, not homosexual there. There was one from Kriena, there was from Belgium. There was from Norway and German. This Ukrainian, I was a little friend because it was very easy, Polish and Ukraine language is similar so that we were like friends. We talk most than with other prisoners, and after maybe two months, because every time came control, especially one was very, very bad, probably he was from Hamberg, somebody said to me. I don't know exactly for everybody block meister we gave a special nickname. Let's say this horse Polish it was , it means horse head, because he's looking horselike. He said, "Oh, you are still here? You must go work. He is not sanitary. You will sin heathen." What I had to do, I had to leave and I was sent to one cell, one person cell. As I told you maybe before with it's description on my door, , with animals. I <span class="page-break" number="32"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 9 hard, with other prisoners. The nationality I told you was most of them were Polish, some German, some English, and also from Ukraine. But Ukraine, I was wondering why from Ukraine, then after the war I can remember because Ukraine was treated a little better. They had collaborated with Germany and maybe the prisoners were better treated. It was the reason.</p><p> Frankly speaking, maybe it was not so -- only the work was very hard. The food was maybe just a little better but not much better than in Koronovo. Of course, there was not enough to be food, but better than in Koronovo. I don't know why, but one time they had to send me to</p><p> . Then I also feel what happened here was a big change. Then somebody said</p><p> to me that my mother applied -- I don't know this is kind of a group for German cities and like that. She wanted to help me. Then after the war my sister she told me she wanted to take the lawyers advocate. She had done everything to release me from this, and this was the reason that I was sent from Koronova to the Strum generally for the young prisoners. Not so the crimes like in Koronovo, there was completely different.</p><p>Q. Which kind of release --?</p><p>A. This is like German release, this belongs maybe for better treating. It was a kind of -- it was exactly a group , | don't know. I had never seen this. I had <span class="page-break" number="33"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0 therefore, when I wrote the book, I asked the writer to find old documents. First I wanted to find my full documentation. I wanted to have the same that's happened in east Germany. He has done everything, he couldn't. What I received, I received only an option of one part of these documents which was as I told you, -- but it is not exactly the same.</p><p>Q. In Stum 2 <span class="page-break" number="34"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 1 A. No, it was a prison. We were always in a group. We had to go with the block meister.</p><p>After it was from early morning to evening. It was dark. We came back. We had received hot soup, evening first and the morning we left.</p><p>Q. How many hours did you have to work?</p><p>A. Oh, it was very long. Let's say from 8:00 until 4:00 afternoon. Because it was quickly dark. I remember this was autumn and it was very cold. Before I tried to do my best and it was you know, everybody had a place. You had to -- then I met also this Ukrainian Andre. He was Andre also and he came to me with some , you know he wanted to give me, he found that we were staying also in very good friendship.</p><p>Q. Were there any other gay boys?</p><p>A. In Stum I didn't find no gay boys, no Jews. In the same, no Jews. Only in Koronovo.</p><p>Q. When were you ordered to 2 A. It was maybe December -- before -- maybe December 1944. Yes, I was sent there and it was very fine block meister there. He sent me immediately to the job, the magazine. You know, where the dresses of the prisoners there. It was a rather good job because I was not so -- and then I met in Stum, I met also Hendrick. This was from Holland and we in Stum we worked also together. I was a friend with this Hendrick and when we came to he was <span class="page-break" number="35"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 2 A.

After this came the Russian soldiers. So, that it was in winter, half of January 1945.</p><p>Q. How many people were all together in do you know?</p><p>A. Let's say maybe three or four hundred. When we were sent from the ; there were two groups, two groups, and it was in winter. We had to go by foot and they give us attention. When we tried to escape they will shoot immediately. They stopped only from time to time in some , to sleep there. We had sleep only on the straw so without nothing. I remember it was winter, very cold. When we slept there even there was between the wood the wind with snow would come in and you wake and you had plenty of snow. But butter there instead.</p><p>Q. Did anyone try to escape?</p><p>A. Yes, tried, and we don't know what happened. Many, many tried. Maybe succeed or maybe not succeed. I don't know. We, when I escaped, we escaped we succeeded.</p><p>Q. Do you remember if anybody tried to escape from Stum?</p><p>A. No, no.</p><p>Q. And from ?</p><p>A. No. It was too difficult. Probably nobody could in that. You see there was so surround and with they were watching and in concentration camp there was also the electricity. You couldn't do that.</p><p>Q.

We stood there in this barrack. There was no</p><p> central heating. We had only through -- they gave us wood, but it was warm rather, so long as you put the wood. It was warm. Sometimes the guard would bring some kind of tea that somebody put in the water. Some they drank, but only prisoners who had a special contact with somebody. I had no contact so I couldn't do nothing. I was living, as I told you, with Hendrick.</p><p>He was upstairs. He was working for the tailor.</p><p>Q. Did your mother know where you were?</p><p>A. At this moment, she knew. She had received information that I'm -- but I never saw her.</p><p>It was not allowed to visit to come, no, but she knew and we have also family, relations in</p><p> probably across the river somebody has seen me and wrote to my mother that I am alive, but she told me later, when we talked, after my return from Germany, she said somebody said I am alive and she wasn't sure exactly, but her hope was a little better.
