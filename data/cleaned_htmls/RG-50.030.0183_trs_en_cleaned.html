And it was a very nice, nice family. It was old-fashioned, but not too much old-fashioned.... My mother died when I was sixteen. Then we spread, and I went with my eldest sister. And I went uh to school again, because I didn't know what to become...I didn't...I didn't want to do anything. There was nothing I liked to do, you know? And, uh, so I first had a...I worked with the um...uh, American company there, telegraph company, and I learned to type blind; and at that time uh there was a girl, and she said to me, "You must come to...I, I'm dance...I do a little bit dancing, and we have a performance in in the theater in Amsterdam. You must come and have a look." And then I did that. And I knew from that moment what I wanted to become, because it was very advanced ...uh modern dance, at that time. It was in "30. I was about eighteen, I think. And there were a lot of men--about twenty men, I thought--in that choir, you know; but, uh, dance...dance. And it was very interesting.</p><p>A woman who...I, I went there the next day, and I got my class...amateur classes because I was still at, uh, Cath...uh, Catholic school. Because my father was bookbinder, had an office in house (ph). My brother was printer; and so I thought, "Well, ....". And then I got an, after three years I got a marvelous job. And then in between I learned what dancing was, a little bit; and a woman, [Florrie Hodlechko (ph)], she asked me to become professional.</p><p>And I said to her "I, I have no money for that." "Well," she said, "I do it for nothing." And so I started. I started the same day, perhaps a name will say something in America. [Lucas Offing (ph)], a very famous dancer in America, and in Holland too; he was...we started the same day dancing with this woman.</p></p></dialogue>

It should have been there, but I don't...we lived in a quarter where there were many many people, and we were...well-to-do people, and there was nothing in particular difficult. Because then I was at a school where I...twenty-eight pupils, there were at least twenty Jews. But my mother had a special, uh, relig...religion for herself, so she thought it was unthinkable that God would not uh...would uh be so that you had not to learn on Saturday.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, the moment that they had to move to uh, to the Jewish quarter, that I knew immediately that I would go underground--or how do you call it?--and, uh, I had a very nice house, small house, in the Jewish quarter.

For example, the first thing I did was a Coppelia; one of the...one of the boys, of course. And it was a very pleasant company, not too big; and so I danced there until "42. And then I went to the hiding address, and it was a marvelous address in, in, near Amsterdam.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Before you went into hiding, can you tell me what the Germans, the Nazis, did to the townspeople in Amsterdam and what the people's response was?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I must say you notice...I notice...noticed nothing. I am a very strange character. I didn't want to hear about it. I knew I would hide, and I didn't see my family anymore because they were already in hiding places and uh.... Of course, you didn't know where...nobody knew anything about anybody. And uh I got uh...because I...at that time I was very blond, and blue-eyes; and so for Germans, it was unthinkable that I was Jewish. So I was very free to walk around and to do everything I wanted to do.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When did your family go into hiding?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't know.

And, uh, they went in hiding in a place near, quite near Amsterdam. And there was a minister, you know...a ___ minister, from what I heard afterwards from my other brother-in-law. And he said to my brother-in-law, "Do you have a lot of money with you?" And he had. "And don't you think it's better that you give it to me?" And he said, "Well, yes." And then the next day he was thrown out...of the house, of the hiding place. And then my sister was a very nervous <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> person. She wanted to go back to her own house, which was already more or less raided by the neighbors. But she got things back, and they waited until the Germans came to fetch them.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Who did you perform for?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: For a few friends of this woman...she was also (laughter) of the society, grown up, the theosophic society. That is in this little town, it was the center there; and so she had a lot of good friends, but they didn't know that I was uh hidden. They thought I was bombed out of The Hague. That was our story. She had family in The Hague; and so she made the nephew who was bombed out, and I took her name and I got the right, uh, papers.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh well, at first it was all the training.

And we read a lot, and we walked a lot; and uh we had a very ordinary life and the shopping in the nearest town. And uh, and in...when I was shopping there in Hilversum, suddenly I saw my brother--who was in uh, in Holland ...1n the concentration camp in Holland--and uh went (pause)... and I went up to him and I said, "Mr. Poons, how are you?" He said, "I don't know you." I said, "Yes, but I am your brother." And then we talked for ten minutes; and I asked, "Why don't you uh, go hiding?" He said, "I can't. They don't do anything to me. I have in uh..." Westerbork, is it?..."my wife and children are there, so I can't stay away. And I have all the supervision of everything <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> that's printed, so they will not do nothing to me."</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was he supervised when he left Westerbork?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I don't think so; because they were sure he would come back. He was quite alone there, because of his wife and his work, what he did there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Why didn't he recognize you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because I was blond. I wasn't blond before the war; and during the war there was a lot of peroxide (laughter) and....</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you dyed your hair?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When you were hiding, did you have false ID papers?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. First very uh...the first time they were very bad papers of an acquaintance, of the pianist of the company. And then I suddenly was in a shop, and the owner of the shop said to me...it was an empty shop..."Do you need good papers?" And I was a little bit, uh, taken back, and said, "Well, I don't know." And I asked this woman where I lived...she said, "Oh, yes. It's alright." And the next day I went and said, "Well, this offer you made me yesterday, it's alright. Now somebody will come to you." And comes someone.... We became very, very good friends afterwards, because he was a...he spoke fluently Dutch. I thought he came from the eastern part of the country. But it was a German Communist, married with a Jewish woman...one child; and they had a house quite near us where about thirty people were hidden. All her family were there. And it was very strange, because uh he said to me, "Do you have any work?" I said, "Oh, there is nothing to draw." I was drawing. It was in my papers that it was...how do you call it? Graphics. He said, "No, I don't mean that. I mean, of course, are you still doing something in dance?" I said, "How do you know that you're...that I'ma dancer?" And he said, "My wife is a dancer, too; and she saw you many times in, here in [Hausen (ph)] walking." And then afterwards I met her; and we took the vitality to, to rent a studio in a nearby city, near my village, and we went to train there for a while. And then they were uh, um...they were all taken away by Germans, of course. It was somewhat</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Who was that? <span class="page-break" number="7"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Who did that?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Who...who was taken away?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The family that you...you were living with in that town?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. Well, I was dancing only with this one woman. And I never saw the other ones who lived in that house. I never came to that house, only a few moments. And I had the luck there that this woman had said to me, "If there is something wrong with your bike, or something else, we always know people who can make it all right." And so one day we had given...on a Friday night, we took our bikes there and we could get them on Monday; and we had given them books to read and they had given us books to read. We were on the...on the verge of uh going there to fetch books and the bikes; and we were outside and I said to the woman...I wasn't living..."Let us wait for the postman." He was in the house nearby. And the postman said, "Well, you have heard about it?" That the Germans are at this moment in the house where they are. So then I went...we went back. And I had to leave this house, of course, because...because it was too dangerous. Perhaps they found out letters or.... And so I...I didn't know what to do. And I had met just, before I went away from Amsterdam...I uh had a lunch with friends--an actor and and friend of his who was student in [Maarthen (ph)]--and they was having lunch with me, in the Jewish part of the town, of course. And then we were having luncheon; and I don't know why but I had all the family silver... the forks and spoons and..., and then soon there was a ring at the door. You can't imagine it now. And there were two very uh, well, violent persons and they came to fetch the silver...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: ?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah...Anaz...Nazis, of course. And they were very polite. And I said, "Well, they are all on the table. Take it away."</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did they know it was there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did they know it was there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I couldn't tell you. They just tried, perhaps; or they knew from someone. And then this student boy, this...certainly he was--his wife was his screen...he said to me when they left, "If ever you are in trouble, you can...here is my phone number in [Maarthen (ph)], where I live." And at that time...I mean.... "44, "43...I phone him. And he said, "Well, come to me." And I stayed with him for a fortnight, and everything was clear again; and afterwards he came to us, when they started to go after the students. <span class="page-break" number="8"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And what was it like when you stayed with him for a fortnight?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, excellent.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yes. I went everywhere. I went even to a performance in a nearby city of the company where I was in; and it was a little bit stupid, but nothing happened. And uh I went shopping.</p><p>And nobody paid any attention to me, ever. And only when there was a razzia in this...in the village, in the street where I lived, and I was uh.... Well, we lived in a nice house, a nice villa; and uh next to us there were two...a German brother and sister lived there. But they were already for thirty or forty years in Holland, and never spoke German. And in the morning, at seven o'clock in the morning, suddenly I heard that they were speaking German; and I said to the woman...I said, "Please go and have a look." And she went out to have a look, and she...she said to me...she made a sign; and we had a marvelous hiding place in the house. And I went there in two minutes. And then they came in.</p></p></dialogue>

And then I heard them come in to the uh bathroom, but it was so nice and so well done that they couldn't imagine that there was an entrance to the, uh under the floor; so I laid there down. It was all over with, with blankets and everything. And after a while I heard this woman laughing with them outside because she was glad that they were outside... out of the house.</p></p></dialogue>

And my brother-in-law. And then there came...uh, there was a Polish woman, a dancer; and she started a small group. And I heard, and I was engaged for two weeks. But because I got terrible [allergies always (ph)], during the rehearsal I left the company again. And then we went with this first woman I had class with, and who made this [fantasist (ph)] ballet. She made the ballet about the uh setting, about the time during the war; and with that company, we went to Copenhagen for the Concours. And when we came back--there was only half an hour--and um when we came to uh, back to Amsterdam, we thought it was a pity because there wasn't ballet. And then we made with a few other people a new company... <span class="page-break" number="11"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: When you say "we," who are you referring to?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was Mascha TerWeeme, and [Florrie Hodlechko (ph)], and the dancers of the time;</p><p> and Je Donke (ph)].</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When did you meet Mascha TerWeeme?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I knew her before the war. She was in the same company with Yvonne George. She was the first dancer at the time. And now, I don't know...and she lived in Amsterdam, so I went up to her...it's very easy. She lived at the same address, so there was no difficulty at all.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was the ballet involved at all in helping the resistance efforts?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I can't...I don't know. Of, of course I don't know, because I wasn't there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And when you were, after you just described...how was your life after liberation?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Excellent. A marvelous time. I liked dancing. I liked uh...I did teaching; I liked teaching, and uh that's what I said ...you had, you had to have luck. A friend of mine said the other day to me--the man, that friend whom you met yesterday--he said, "The only thing you had to have is mazel." And it's true. It's true.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So what company did you dance with then, after the war?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: After I was danced with this Ballet de Laaglanden, the Lowlands Ballet, Ballet of the Lowlands. And in in "50.."54, I suddenly stopped dancing. I was only 41 or so. I was not old.</p><p>And I started a studio for myself, already; and then afterwards, I had to do with the company of young Skapino Ballet. And I gave them training, and I made a lot of ballets for them. And so I stopped with everything when...when I became director of the Academy of Dancing...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Which one?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Skapino Dance Academy. And that was a part of the theater school afterwards. I started in "55 for myself; and then I got acquainted with Skapino, , the director, and so it grew and grew. And there again I had a lot of luck.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can you tell me about your life from that point to the present?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: My private life? <span class="page-break" number="12"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: you just described to us what, what's happened currently?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, you know I met my friend in "51, and we had a very happy life. (Pause--weeping) It's your fault, you asked me. Now and then, I went on giving classes and being Director of this school, this academy. And I've really had a very nice life.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can you tell me about some of the things you've choreographed?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Hmm?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can you tell me about some of the things you've choreographed, about your students?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I choreographed for the company always, uh...well, abstract ballets, and, and story ballets. And, uh, for my students, I made everything because, uh, I had to do with the smaller ones and it had grown up. And I did all kinds of things; even when I was 64, I did in the ballet Coppelia, the old man... because one of the pupils fell ill a week before the performance, so I had to take the part. It was very nice.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Are there certain individuals you've enjoyed dancing with the most?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Hmm?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Are there certain individuals you've enjoyed dancing with the most?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, in a big company and I dance with a colleague a lot of duets. It's a [pas de donke (ph)], and we made them ourselves. And when you're in a company you have to dance with everybody, you know. That's just the fun of it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Have there been any other...have there been exceptional students ?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Pupils of mine? Yes, a few. Yes, certainly there have. A few with the National Ballet now, and a few of the boys will become one of the...they became good choreographers. The younger ones at the moment are nearly all ex-pupils of mine, that they're all 30 or 40</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: May I ask...when did you find out what had happened to your family?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Shortly after the war, of course, when they brought all these lists and.... But my father came back from Theresienstadt, and my second sister came back. And then, as I say I, I don't know where they died. I don't know; because the family should know, but I didn't want to hear about it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Is there anything you'd like to add? <span class="page-break" number="13"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Huh?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Is there anything else you'd like to add?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Ah, no. Many things happened during the war. I always felt...sometimes very interesting, but well..you have...you certainly will have much more stories told than I can tell you. When these people what I told you about in in Hausen (ph) were all taken away. They all were taken away; and afterwards, a few months afterwards, we got the message that uh there were papers in the house left from the underground. And they had, um, one daughter; and it was...when these people would have, had been married really--the German Communist with the Jewish woman--then the child was not Jewish, and uh...at the moment. Then they took...they didn't take the girl away [NB: the Germans regarded her as non-Jewish, and therefore did not take her]. She was hidden in the house by the doctor, I think. And then a few days later, we heard that...well, we had to find out that these people were not married at all. So the underground knew that this child was...should been taken next day. So we were with a few people, and we took this child away from this house in...early in the morning. She lives now in East Germany, and uh I often see her. She's now a grandmother already.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You and who else took the child?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Now, I didn't took the child. Marion [von] Binsbergen, Marion Pritchard [NB: the reference is to the same individual, under first her maiden and then her married names]...she was leading. And the parents of this child always tell them everywhere that I did it, and I gave up to contradict them. Even the books they have written this, and Marian has it now. As if I, I uh rescued the child; and it was not me. It was Marion who did it. Because there wasn't...they have told she had spoken with this doctor, and he should be away early in the morning and his wife should open the door. And when we came she didn't dare. She didn't open the door, and uh Marian took in hand and took the child away. She hit this woman. She knocked her down, and took the child away.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: She essentially kidnapped her?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, quite true. Yes, fortunately. Otherwise she would have gone to concentration camps.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you with Marian? You were with Marian at the time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, we saw each other.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, in this particular instance?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, yes, yes. But it was just an incident. And uh when we took, afterwards we tried to find these papers in the house. And that's like a a story in a play, you know? Because I told you I did a lot of uh movement exercises and then I had to... had one...woman [where] I was hidden...she climbed up the house and uh threw something through the window. And she <span class="page-break" number="14"></span> throw everything out in our house what she could find, also the papers that they are looking for. And I stood outside...it was outside the, the village; and I was looking around and I was laughing a little bit...that I don't what I should do if somebody came. I didn't know what to do, and nothing happened.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You knew the person who was throwing them out? I'm a little confused. Who was throwing them out?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The the woman who, um...where I was hidden. She was also underground...engaged with people. And it was like a comic scene. It was...it was in the middle of the night, and we were not allowed to be on the street; and we took the mattresses and everything out of the house. It was ridiculous.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Are there other such stories that you can recall?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Uh hmm...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you have other such stories that you can recall?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. I don't think so, but I...no. I only recall that uh uh...I told you my sister was...came to us, and afterwards she went to uh a peasant family. But she couldn't travel with her bags. And so we said, "Well, we come...we come after you, afterwards, a few days later with all your luggage." And this woman where I was hidden, she--uh, Mrs. [Hanneloos (ph)]--she, uh, was weaver and so she had to buy wool. So we went there, and we said, "Well, of course, we are here to find wool." I, I don't think there was one sheep, but that didn't matter. And when we came after a long trip to this village, there came then policeman and said, "What are you uh...what are you doing here?" So we said, "Well, we are looking for, uh, wool." He said, "Well, I don't think so that it's true. I think you are going to Mrs. De Vrieses (ph),"--my sister--"who is hidden away with Frau Haut (ph)." And it was true. But we said, "No, we don't know anything about that. We were just looking for wool." And I show him..."Show your passports," and I gave to him. It was good and he gave it back. And my, uh, guest, uh, woman, how you say? She gave hers, and he said to her, "Well, this is false." And I said to this man, "Well, how can you say that? Of course, it is not false!Otherwise we would be much more nervous." And he said to me, "Well, you needn't be nervous. I can see that. But this woman is totally..." Uh...uh...how do you call that? "Bleak... have lost all color, you know." And then he said, "Well, it's alright. Go to this house; because you needn't be afraid.</p><p>I made the hiding places for Mrs. [De Vries (ph)]." And when we came there, they laughed a little bit. But again, the luck.... This man was after the war, had been I think ten or twenty years in prison because he had given people to the Nazis; and by chance not my sister and not us. Luck...mazel.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Anything else that you'd like to add or 2</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no, I don't...it was not a very interesting time. It was a nice time, and we followed <span class="page-break" number="15"></span> everything and we thought what we should do after the war. And I wanted to dance again.</p><p>And that happened.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was it hard putting your life back together again after the war?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no. No, not at all. No. I got a room...I got an engagement since I couldn't...I don't...I don't remember. I'm not so very much interested in money, so I really don't remember where that money came from after the war; but somebody have given it to me for a while and then we...I got an engagement in 8</p></p></dialogue>
