Whether it was clean or dirty or infected, we didn't think about it, nor did we care about it. All we knew because we were thirsty. And then one time, one -- one time we got to a water and we just ran into the water and -- clothes and all and drinking and -- an-and bathing and just name it, we did in the water. Then they wa -- some of them wanted to swim away from it, and they were killed in the water. We got out of it, and I think that was the last time that we had water that I know of, is when we were at the river. And then we walked about a couple more days.
