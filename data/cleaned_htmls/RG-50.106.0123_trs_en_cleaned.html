We didn't know nothing about it, we never even heard there's such a thing as gas chambers. So he said, they're burning bodies. One who died and one who was killed. And as we walked in on the right side into the camp, we looked back and we saw my parents, my father, my mother and sister with the little children, well that was the last time I did see them.

Sometimes we stopped earlier and just like the man was saying, we were using whatever y -- tools you had to make a hole and get some water out of the field to drink it because there was no water. And if you walked on the main line, there was the sewer -- not, I wouldn't say sewer, but water drainage, and -- and we used to drink water. Whether it was clean or dirty or infected, we didn't think about it, nor did we care about it. All we knew because we were thirsty. And then one time, one -- one time we got to a water and we just ran into the water and -- clothes and all and drinking and -- an-and bathing and just name it, we did in the water. Then they wa -- some of them wanted to swim away from it, and they were killed in the water. We got out of it, and I think that was the last time that we had water that I know of, is when we were at the river. And then we walked about a couple more days. And they said pretty soon we going to go into a -- no, I think -- I think we were about -- I would say about maybe three or 400 mi-- kilometers we walked. Then they put us on the train. Where it was, I couldn't tell you.</p></p></dialogue>

And no one experienced what the man in -- in Auschwitz said, the first thing you do is get out a ca--a death camp. And exactly that's what we did, and we got to a small town, what they call Mildorf(ph).

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I feel that it is nothing we could have done, but the world as a whole, yes, it could have done. And I felt, as "m speaking in an engagement, that what happened to us, it could happen to other people, because people are fighting not a war, but always a religious war. Whatever the reason it is, it happens -- it just so happened now in Russia is the same way with the Orthodox Ukrainian, with the Muslims over there, or Yugoslavia, the Serb, and the Muslim. So it could and it does happen.</p><p>But as far how I feel about it, I think the world could have stopped it and I feel that partly President Roosevelt was also like against the Jewish people, which I feel it wa -- you know, that's what everybody else feels the same way about it, because he sent the ship back and the Germans figured nobody wanted, so might as well kill us.</p></p></dialogue>

So that's was one thing. The second, when I'm in a speaking engagement, I feel all if I sleep, I dream sometimes, but I try to get away from it because it -- it brings bad memories. So -- but I have to talk about it for the simple reason I get it--I get it out of my system and I feel a hundred percent better.
