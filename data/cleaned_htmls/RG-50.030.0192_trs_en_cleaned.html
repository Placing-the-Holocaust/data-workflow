<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Would you tell me your name please?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My name is Barbara Rodbell, currently. My maiden was Lederman.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And where and when were you born?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I was born in Berlin, Germany, September 4, 1925. My mother's name was Else Citroen Citon, which means lemon, and it is a Dutch name because her father was from Holland had come from -- to Germany from Holland, and married my grandmother, Ellen Citreon Sileppe. Her name was Sileppe in Berlin. And so that is how the Dutch family lived in Berlin because that's where they married. They were three children, the old-- four children actually, the oldest died very -- at 18. She was a poet and a wonderfully, well loved child, and she had a brain tumor and died. It took a while year and my youngest uncle tells that he has never seen his mother in anything but black ever after. So I saw her in other clothes, but he never saw her in anything but black as he grew up. At least that's how he sees it. People sees things in different ways. My mother, I remember as a childhood, as being relatively happy and her oldest brother was Paul, and he was lively and he was a painter. Didn't pay attention to anything but painting and art. And then she -- then it was she, and then it was a brother, Hans who also survived the war. The -- they all -- the brothers survived the war.</p><p>Each of them had their own story, but they all survived the war. We lived in Berlin, and I had a sister, named Susannah who was three years younger than I was. And we -- my father was a lawyer, born in Hisberg, Silesian, over Silesian, and in Germany and studied in Verslomberland, later in Geneva for his Ph.D. in law. And he had a good practice. And he was quite old really. He was 35 when he married my mother. My mother was 20. That was done that way, that way, in those days. Anyway, I was born a year later and I remember my childhood in Berlin as being wonderful. It was -- my father loved Berlin, and we went all over Berlin as soon as I could walk. And he showed me absolutely everything. Every little corner, and he liked history and music and we went to museums and I still remember where the Rembrandt hung in this museum in Ber-- in Berlin because he loved it so. And I remember the trains from Casovillan trains, and the stories he told me about how Casovillan used to have big dinners in those trains, and he was a very faster easter, Casovillan was.</p><p>Nobody ever got anything to eat because he was always finished before the last person was served and everybody had to leave very hungry. This was one of my father's story, stories.</p><p>And my sister was born three years later, and we were very happy. We always went to Holland on vacation. And in 1933, when we went to Holland on vacation, one of my many cousins of my father's, Uncle Biet Pierson who was a journalist, a editor of a paper in The Hague said to my mother he felt that she should not go back. This was 1933. And Uncle Biet had, when he was very young -- when he was 19 and, and just learning to be a journalist, he had been sent to Munich to cover a trial. And nobody in Holland paid in attention to this trial. And when he came back and he wrote up his paper, they said to him, "Why are you making such a fuss?" And he said, "You pay attention to this trial. This is going to end up <span class="page-break" number="0"></span> being something quite awful and better everybody pay attention." It was Hitler's trial in 1923. And he was, you know, he was the only of them paid any attention to it. Took 10 years til things really heated up. So my mother, who always listened to my father because my father was the older one and, you know, he was the leader in our family said to my father, "I think we shouldn't go back." And my father said, "What does a lawyer do in a foreign country?" That's not a very good idea, and what am I going to do?" And she said, "Well, I don't know. You'll find something to do. It's -- I really think we should not go back." And so father said, "Well, I'm going to go back and see what I can do." I mean he had -- I think he graduated he'd already been a lawyer for 25 years. I mean it was -- it was practically impossible for him to start over. He spoke a few words of Dutch, but not very much. He got to Berlin and he went into his office and there were his secretaries and his assistants and stuff. There was also a big letter from the government, which said that from now on, he could only have Jewish clients. My father had no -- had very few, I should say, Jewish clients. I didn't know any Jewish clients that he had. But he had things like the Mid- European Watch Industry, a___, Swiss Watch industry. He had big companies that were his clients, and now he could not represent them anymore. He packed up. And we could still -- [mean he could ship as much as he wanted to Holland. And we had two grand pianos, and he sold them because he didn't think that we could -- would have the money to have enough house or an apartment big enough to hold grand pianos so there was a big change in our standard of living. I mean I was raised with nurses and governesses and with English and French and you have Dutch and all those various things, with horse back riding and good schools. And when we got to Holland, of course, we had a little apartment. My father had to go back to school, to the -- to the university. He worked for a Dutch . He worked for a Dutch lawyer, but he had to learn Dutch, of course. He handled the clients who were very much like him who had come to Holland and, you know, he couldn't practice along because he didn't have the Dutch degree. So he went to the university, and I think he was now -- how old was he in "34, 35? He graduated in three years in a foreign language. I was -- we were very proud of him. It was very hard. He also worked at the same time. There was a big party and everybody came and then a few years later the Germans walked in, and it was all over.</p><p>We are now getting to the point where my -- Let me go back and say that when we got to Holland and I got to my first school, in my class was a girl named Margo Frank. And they lived riocht behind us on the We lived at the which was the hack of the <span class="page-break" number="1"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Let's -- let's talk a little more about your friends and your childhood. Did you meet Ann Frank too?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, of course, we all played together, you know. And Ann came to the house a lot and we went to her house a lot. When my kids grew up, I -- I could see that, you know, the same kind of thing, you know. You -- you go around to the people in your neighborhood and you work together for the schools and you do various things and My sister was a lot more serious than Ann was. Anne liked games the way I did. And she liked to play and have imagina -- imaginary games, and she was very high strung -- very easily upset, and -- . My sister tried to get along with all that, but it wasn't always easy. Ann was a very difficult child, an extremely difficult child. And not just for her family, but in school and she went to a special school, a Montessori kind of school I think or Dalton in one of those two kinds of school. And she did very well there. Not as well as Margaret, who was an absolute genius, if you ask me. But who -- Margaret also was very calm, and at least what I always saw of her was very calm, very deliberate, very, very beautiful. Margaret was very beautiful. Had great big brown eyes -- a very serious person. She would have made a real mark in the world. I know that. Just like my sister. My sister -- .I can't even imagine how wonderful she would have been. She was so smart and so sweet and -- and she was very anxious to be very close to me which was amazing, you know, for a young girl. She wanted to see what I was doing and later on, as I got older, she was very interested in my friends and she always had very -- a lot of good advice for me. This is no good, and this is very good, and you know, she was just -- and she was so sensible. It was amazing! One of the letters I gave you is from her, and there you will see all that. It's a very good letter. Very, very young girl! Anyway, we had a normal, very happy kind of childhood with a lot of music and my Uncle Paul was a painter and a Dutchman, a Dutch painter, with a enormous German accent, but his nationality was Dutch. He was born in Berlin, but at 18 he had to choose whether he wanted to be German or Dutch because he was born in Germany but -- but he had a Dutch passport because of his father. And something in him made him make the right choice and he chose Holland and he went to Holland and -- and lived there even since, and became quite a well known painter and had a very happy life in -- in Holland. Married a beautiful woman, had a daughter, and I have two very close relatives about my same age. One is his daughter, Paulinka, and one is the daughter of my Uncle Hans, the younger brother of my mother who is Tamara and she is in Israel. She lives in Israel with her family. And now why was I telling you all this?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Family and friends.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Family and friends. Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can we go back a little bit? I would like to go back just cause it has some relevance to your childhood. There was a group of friends with you and Ann Frank and Margo. You had talked Hanna. You had talked about Tummi. And there's a picture all of you playing at the party.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes. Well <span class="page-break" number="2"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Tell us about that circle and tell us about that party.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, these were -- these were mostly -- mostly, because on some of those pictures are also a lot of Dutch kids who were playing also who only were living in the same neighborhood. By the neighborhood was entirely mixed. Wasn't all Jewish. Was a completely mixed neighborhood. And as far as I knew the Dutch Jews and the Germans Jews got along very well. And I have just read a book which said that they were really pretty separate when it came to it..you know when things got tight. But I personally have never -- have never experienced that. And when I got to think about it not until I got in with a group of young people who were stridently trying to survive was it really all German? -- at that point I realize it was all German. It wasn't really my family that created that kind of atmosphere, but it was more when we were on our own, without family, you know, that it suddenly appeared that I really was in a German Jewish circle. This was when we were trying to save ourselves, you understand? As -- as children we played altogether -- everybody played together and was very good relationships between everybody. I've never heard my parents or Otto Frank, who by the way was an absolute angel, ever, you know, say anything nasty or have -- had any kind of problem with Dutch with the Dutch people. And, of course, I was half Dutch anyway. And the first time I realized I really wasn't Dutch was when the Germans came to Holland and there was five days where -- before -- before the Queen left Holland, while the Germans were there -- while the Dutch were fighting the Germans we were not allowed -- we had a great curfew. We were not allowed in the streets. And my grandparents and my neighbors had to bring -- my grandmother and my neighbor had to bring us food and everything because they wouldn't allow Germans -- we were then taken as Germans, not -- not as German Jews, but as Germans, and we weren't allowed to go out and to buy food except very limited periods of time during the day. It was the first time that I realized that "Hey. Hey. I'm really German. I'm not really Dutch." I never, you know, it -- I wasn't even aware of it, except when I came from Berlin and I went to school. I was in the -- I was in the 3rd Grade. I was put into the 3rd Grade. I was eight years old. And I had to write what they called in which write. vou know. somebody reads somethings to vou and vou write <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> nurse or a governess with me all the time. I could go, you know -- I wasn't supposed to, but I go more or less where I wanted to. And it was a more relaxed life. It was very hard for my mother, although I didn't hear her ever complain. And my -- I have a cousin who came to visit the other day from Holland and she's much younger. She was much younger than my mother, and she said that my mother never complained. Never! Never! And -- my mother -- I mean she'd had a -- a cook, a cleaning woman, a maid, a nurse for governess for us. You know, she never had anything like that to do. She did that social work. That's what people did. And of course, not for pay. I mean she did social work and now she had to learn to cook.</p><p>My mother never knew had to cook. So she -- her mother was there. My -- my grandmother had gone to Holland before my -- my -- my parents and she taught my mother how to cook because my mother didn't know how. And she -- she had -- I think she had some help every day for a few hours, but that was -- I mean for her, it must have been an enormous change.</p><p>An apartment, it had two stories but it was still a relatively small apartment compared to what she used to have and -- Of course, she was surrounded by family which she had not -- never had her own family. She had a lot of my father's family, but never much of her own.</p><p>And here it was very different. And because the family was Dutch, of course, we slid very fast into the Dutch way of life and aside from my father and my mother and for the children, it was very nice. So I loved it in -- in Holland.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You had again the friends of the children you played with these photographs that you showed us of all of you in a sandbox. and the more famous of one actually shows Ann Frank in there, but all of you were together. Can you tell us about the children in that sandbox.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>What were you doing and what was it like?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, we had -- I think we had a -- I don't remember now exactly, but my cousin she's now called Tamera Cidor, but her name was Dolly Citreon . And -- and she was visiting and we took her over to other familv of ours who lived also on the --~ who lived downstairs <span class="page-break" number="4"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You -- you said before that your sister, Susannah, was friends with Ann Frank.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yal.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can you tell us the kinds of things that they did?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, to my great surprise it seems they were much closer than -- than I had thought because again this cousin from Holland who came to visit recently and who told that my mother was -- was never complaining and working very hard and really wasn't very strong, she was telling me that my sister, Susannah, used to bring Anna -- Ann Frank with her every time they came to visit. And they would visit in -- in The Hague, and they would visit in Glebare, where they had a little summer house, and they would stay for weeks and she describes on the tape, which by the way, I do have but I didn't bring with me she describes how difficult Anna was. And she says how -- now they were older then. I think -- let me see -- I'm -- I was 16 so my sister was 13, and Anna was maybe 12 at that time. So this is a later period that we are actually talking about now. And she describes that Anna was so very much more developed than my sister. Although my sister was only a year older, and how her interests were so very difficult and how difficult it was to keep her calm and interested and uncomplaining and -- and just regular you know. It's a very cute tape actually that little piece of it about Ann. It -- it was amazing to -- to most people, you know. I mean the book is, but - - but I could see a little bit of that I could see that she was thinking about many things. She thought about boys way before Susie ever dreamed of boys. And -- and she -- she would tell me that Susie is really very childish. Susie would say to me, "Ann is just silly. Always with these boys. Who watches that," she says. You know, she didn't want to play. So that's why I was surprised when I heard that at the very end even Ann would go with Susie visiting of -- our family and stuff. Yal. The families were very close. I mean it was due to the fact that it got -- .they're at the time and they were in the same same age more or less. The children were the same age. The interests were a lot alike. My father was a lawyer and -- and Otto, of course, had a business. I don't know if my father worked for him or anything or if he did any of his work, but I'm sure he helped him if there were any problems. So there were a lot of -- a lot of reasons that our families were close. One forgets, you know. One forgets how -- how logical these things develop. There's nothing special. On that other tape that I gave you, Barry Spaanyard keeps asking the mother of Hanna -- Hanna's mother -- keeps saying, "Now how come you didn't know Anna so well? Anna's family. How come you didn't know the Frank's so well? Or how come you didn't -- " And she finally gets impatient with him and she said, "Well, we were families with the Ledermann's and it was just through them that Anna Frank came to play with us." They were not that friendly. I mean it's just -- why should be friend -- nobody is friendly with everybody. So there was no special reason or dislike or like or anything. You know, people know each other or they don't know each other. So that's was it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: What..what were the the Frank parents like. Otto -- <span class="page-break" number="5"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Uh Well, I said already, you know, how fantastic Otto was. He was wonderful with children.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>He was just incredible with children. He was patient. He was loving. He was everything you sort of wanted somebody -- he was also patient with this whole situation -- with the fact that he had to leave all of a sudden. I'm sure they came from the kind of background we did -- and they were reduced to what we were. I think they would probably this was very much the same. It was very much the same. He was very patient with it, and he worked very hard in his business, and he did well for the short time, you know, that -- that he had it. And now the mother -- I don't have that much of an impression of her. I can see her. And, again, I see this beautiful woman. I mean the eyes, and the hair, and just a beautiful woman. And, of course, I'm looking at her now not the way a child would. You know, I'm looking at her from my point of view now. And I realize what in the world she went through. I mean for a woman -- she came from the way my mother was -- had been and -- and she didn't have the the ___.</p><p>She had to stay in the house with children and deal with every day things -- her own shopping, doing her grocery, her own cooking, her own -- It was very different from the way she was brought up. Anyway, she was not as patient. She didn't have the patience for Ann who was really extremely difficult. I mean I wasn't easy at all, but Ann was impossible practically. I mean she was she was difficult. And -- and -- Edith did not have that -- .the patience for her. She did what she could. She was not a nasty mother or an angry mother or hitting mother or anything. She would -- she did what she could and Ann was very luck to have Otto and -- and to calm the waters between her and her mother. So it was a happy family really. And Otto had to work hard to keep Edith happy and to .to keep everything going. And, of course, Margaret did her best. She was more like her father. And it was a happy family. And we saw a lot of them. All the time! I just read a book, which I gave to vou. The one on the and in the book. it tells somethine about Edith. and that's it's the <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> got to Sweden. And, of course, she had -- had it very tough in Sweden. She had to work as a maid for years and things like that. Nevertheless, she made it through. And Anna Marie had talked to my mother in Westerborg, and my mother had told Anna Marie that when it was -- if she ever got out of this alive, she was going to go to the university and become a professional social worker and she was going to make a life of her own and she finally decided to do something for herself. Something that was important for her rather than just working for the family and doing what my father wanted and -- The fellow who saved my life and myself -- one of the reason we didn't end up married after the war was that we had the most terrible fights. And one of the fights was about the fact that he would say that my father murdered my whole family and my -- because by not wanting to go underground -- He had gotten papers for my mother and my sister and my father -- this friend of mine. His name was Monfred. Monfred had gotten papers for all of us. I had it way before from somebody else, but he also got papers for the rest. And my mother had given him the mother for it, so he could get it for her. And, of course, they didn't use it. I will tell later, you know, how -- how this all came about. But they didn't use it. But Monfred used to say, "He killed your mother. He killed your mother." You know, and I would -- I mean we were young.</p><p>Right? I was like 18 -- 17 or 18. I -- I -- no, you didn't -- and I practically would even scratch him and fight and argue and -- Now, I -- I mean it's impossible to point blame. I mean it's impossible. But I think women now would have thought a little bit more for themselves -- maybe for herself. Maybe she would have said -- a woman now would have said, "Well, my dear. As much as I hate it, you know, you do your thing. But this is my life. And this is my child's life, and we are staying. We are taking a chance." My father -- he was older than my mother. And he was more staid, and he was -- and she wouldn't leave him. I mean when it came to it, she went along. And when she went, my sister went, who was only 14 then, you know, although I had told her -- we all had told her, you know, that we would take care of her and we had a place for her and all that kind of thing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Let's see if we can get this in the -- in some sequence.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It would be better to have it in sequence.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Let's go back and do it and so we know what happened. You've had this child -- you're growing up. We're coming to the late "30s. Tell us what happened as the war came closer.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, as far as I was concermed, until the Germans walked into Holland, I didn't know very much about anything. I mean I knew that there was Hitler and that Germany was __ for us, you know. Things were bad. But I was just playing and going to school and dancing and having a good, you know, a good time. And then one day there was -- the radio started talking and -- and then we heard this lot of noise and we heard the bombardment of Rotterdam. We heard it all the way in Amsterdam. I mean it was just -- the planes, the low hum of the planes, and the wait of it. And I remember standing at the window and my father, you know -- the Germans were marching in right through our street which was the main street in _Tt now has a different name. but it was then. I see them sinelinge <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> ____ toward the center of the town. And my father standing in the window and saying to me, "Take care of your mother." I was 15. Take care of the -- your mother. You know, they'll come for me tomorrow. And my -- my father was not political. He'd never been political.</p><p>And that's probably..that's one of the things I'd like to talk about -- about the intellectuals in Germany who felt that they were too good to talk politics. To talk politics was a terrible thing, and you didn't talk. It was for -- for who -- not very good people. I mean you couldn't - - you shouldn't talk politics, you know. So they didn't. And it's we all must be involved and..and fight against things that are bad now, you know, so it doesn't -- terrible things don't happen later. But that's not what they did. And then -- so he thought he was going to be picked up tomorrow. Of course, it took a year and a half, but, you know, it did happen in the end. The -- the first thing that happened, well, many terrible things happened then. People started -- Jews starting jumping out of windows and out of -- of balconies and -- and into -- lulled themselves with gas and I remember standing on the balcony. We lived on the third floor, and the balcony was on the back of the house and -- and there was a center which had the -- had the gardens in -- in the bottom and then balconies everywhere, three stories high.</p><p>And I remember a man being saved from trying to gas himself and him yelling and screaming I don't want to. Don't do this. Don't do this, you know. Don't save me, you know. I want to die. I want to die, you know. And I was 15. I mean this made a helluva impression on me. And I said to me mother, "What -- why does he want to die?" You know, I mean who wants to die? And then there was -- I mean a period there where people it wasn't one or two -- that's what I want to say. It was heaps of people killed themselves. And then my parents told me it's because they're Jews and -- and Hitler, you know, doesn't like Jews and it was the first time I was really aware of -- We're weren't religious so we'd never had any kind of -- or very little connection with it, although my grandparents, I think, were. And I remember going to temple with my grandfather when he was still alive and in -- in Berlin.</p><p>He died in early -- in Berlin while we still living in Berlin. And I remember it being a happy experience. He put me on his back. It was the -- I -- what -- what is the day when when they finish reading the Torah and they start over. Which one? Whatever. And he put me on his back and they danced around, you know, and stuff like that. I -- it was pretty wonderful. And I remember him laying the Tefillin and I never knew what it meant and and we had Christmas at home. I remember the Christmas tree in Berlin was great, with the real candles and the applies and the and the nuts and the the oifts for. for the maids and for <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> 0</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: You're doing just fine. Just tell us what happened now.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Okay. School. We went to school and we had a headmaster who was very anti-Nazi. And much too outspoken. I mean nobody knew what to do and how to behave in those days.</p><p>There was one group who knew a little bit and that was the communists. But I didn't -- didn't know anything about communists, but they were the ones who knew already a little bit because they had had some people who had escaped from camps in German, you know. That was possible to escape. I mean at the very beginning in 1940, "41, people could escape from camps in Germany. And these -- these communists had already been picked up in Germany, put in camps, and they had come through Holland and they had told a little bit of what they had seen and what they had heard. And so they informed their Dutch friends -- the Dutch communists, a little bit about things -- what things were like. So the communists were a little bit prepared, but nobody else was prepared in Holland. And</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What happened to you? You started to say --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The school. The school. Well, the -- the headmaster called assembly and made a large, big speech about the fact that, you know, about the Germans and that we were a free country and we shall remain free and we all sang the song, you know, the national anthem, and.</p><p>Anyway, he got picked up very early, and he died very early because that was -- somebody, of course, told on him. They were fascists in the schools. And then one started to hear about fascists right and left. And one started to hear about our neighbors downstairs who turned out to be not too good, and then we suddenly started to hear things like our neighbors on the other side -- well, he was Jewish, but she was not. Boy, they're lucky. I mean things like that, you know, which you'd never -- I'd never thought they were lucky. I -- you know, I mean, they're know different from us, and weird things -- weird things like that. As far as the school was concermed, I think we could go to school for a little while, but then, again, there was an assembly and we were told that the Jewish kids now had to leave the school and go to a -- a Jewish school, and have be separated from the others. And I went to my parents and -- and I said, "I don't want to go to a Jewish school. I'm not going to a Jewish school. I will not go to a Jewish school." And I can just see my children coming to me and saying I'm not going to go to this school. You know, I can just see the shock. I -- it was impossible. I was really impossible. I got to be very, very rebellious in every way, and I would not go to school. My sister did. She went to a Jewish school. And it was very frightening because what the Germans started to do is to isolate the Jews into various groups. I mean they -- at a later date, not right then in the beginning, but at a later date, they would go and pick up the kids in the school, and then make the parents come to get the kids and, of course, keep the parents and that was the end of that you know. Some people were then sent home again if their parents had good papers, you know some kind of exceptional papers. But I was -- every time I heard that the school -- the Germans or -- or green police or the Dutch cooperators -- the Nazis, the Dutch Nazi, and anaspears. They were called then anaspears marching toward the school, you know, I would run to that school and finally after I had Monfred as a friend, he said to me, "The one thing you do when the Germans go somewhere is not go there." You know, I <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> 1 mean I was so stupid, but we all -- most of us were because what did we know, you know, about how to save yourself and that you had to save yourself. You had to be careful. You have to learn to be scared. And I was not that scared. You know, I was dumb. I was plain old dumb. But it was very frightening to have my sister in a Jewish school separated in the eastern part of Amsterdam. We lived in the south and they had to go to_Oster, Amsterdam -- Amsterdam ost . to school. Most of my friends did do that. Most of my friends that were Jewish did go to school. Some of them were picked up, and their parents and them shipped off. Others, somehow, survived, you know, just like me. You never know what's going to happen to you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What did you do during the day?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I went -- I had to go to school. And I wanted -- I told you I wanted to be a dancer. And there was school ran bv Alice Kavser in Amsterdam. in --_ And she had a dancing school as <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> 2 These were old people who brought their own furniture and their own things. They were -- and she had nurses. It was like -- what would you call it now? A home for the elderly I mean.</p><p>and she ran it. It was her. I mean she set it up. She -- she had to make -- to earn money and and this is what she did. She had help, of course. And one day they came and took everybody including her. They had just emptied out the place. The Germans they had came.</p><p>And my mother was beside herself -- beside herself. What to do? We had to get her back.</p><p>Now the youngest brother, my mother's youngest brother was -- lived in France, and if you want to, I can tell that story. But he lived in France. The older brother lived in The Hague, near The Hague in Gosmer and had no funds, you know, whatsoever. So my mother went and took our jewelry to a jeweler. She got in touch with a guy named Putcomer, who was known to mediate between Germans and other people and -- to get people free. And he said to her that she had to give industrial -- the Germans would take industrial diamonds for my grandmother. Well, my mother went and gave to Nave who was a jeweler, her jewelry and said. "I need industrial diamonds. Just see what vou can do." And Nave came back and <span class="page-break" number="11"></span> 3 call it when you -- impulsive grandmother said, I have to get some of my paintings. I have to get some of my rugs. I have to get some of my this, and I have to get my silver and my -- Else, you need it, she said to my mother. You should have it. I mean why should the German get it. What the Germans used to do was after they took everybody out of the house, they would go and take all the furniture and whatever was there and I am -- I don't know what they did with it. I think they probably later on gave it to the people who were bombed out, or they gave it to Goering and he took what he wanted and then gave it to -- I mean I just don't know where the stuff went. But my grandmother went, without telling my mother, went to her house. Of course, she had the key and she went in and, of course, the house was being watched, and my grandmother was taken again. And that was it. I mean there was no jewelry to sell. and Mr. Putcomer -- my mother starting running around to Putcomer, to this, to that, and she couldn't get my grandmother back out. And I have letters of hers and I mean which are so -- so touching. There's just no words for it, you know, I mean, where she says -- "Oh, my poor Mooty," she calls her Mooty, of course, "and Mooty, she doesn't even have a blanket and she doesn't even have a sweater. I mean she just went there. Right? She does have anything, and how am I going to get to her?" And these letters are also a brother in Voltsneir who couldn't budge. He couldn't -- Anyway, and she managed, she got to somebody who managed to bring my grandmother a blanket and to bring my grandmother a sweater and to bring her some shoes while she was still in -- on the , there was which was a Jewish theatre. It was in the Amsterdan Oldst, which had become a Jewish section. There was a Jewish theatre where -- where plays and musicals and stuff were being performed and that was now used for a collection place for Jews from Amsterdam and that were going to be shipped to Westerborg.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Would you both tell us her name and tell us what happened to her?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Her name is Ellen Citreon Sleppe. Her name is Sleppe. I think I mentioned her when I spoke about Berlin. What happened to her was that she was first sent to Westerborg, where she was quite awhile. She stayed quite awhile, and then she was sent to Bergen-Belsen which was, in a way, not as bad as Auschwitz. It was bad enough and she did died there. She died of illness, but the stories that come back about her are fantastic. Again, this Anna Marie Rosenbaum I talked about earlier who was exchanged to Sweden, she was telling about my grandmother and she actually brought me a little purse which my grandmother -- .send it to me, which my grandmother had given her. she said that my grandmother always had some tea. If it was made out of thistles or if it was made out of anything you know or what I sent -- I -- we did send packages to them in Westerborg. We managed to do that. And she had tea and she would have a -- a napkin over an orange crate and she would always have something when people came to visit, and she was always upbeat and she was always brave. And my grandmother had been a volun -- done voluntary work as a nurse and she was doing that in the camp. She was 72. She wasn't old. And she was extremely energetic, and so when she was sent to Bergen-Belsen, she lasted quite awhile there, but in the end, she did die in Bergen-Belsen. But we heard nothing but nice things about her. Anyway where shall we go now?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What happened to you? Grandma has been taken away.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Grandma has been taken away. And we are now starting to -- to get -- people my age -- I was -- let's say, I was 16 going on 17 I guess. The Germans started to call up young Jewish children like me who were 16 and up. At 16 you were considered a family on your own by the Germans. And they would call up -- these German -- .young people by name, not in big ___, but by name. And I had many friends who were called up and we used to have -- they had parties before they -- the night before they went, they would have parties and they would sit around and they would say oh, what we're going to do. We're all going to get together. It was like _ vou know. as if thev were ooineg to Israel. like it was soine to be a -- a <span class="page-break" number="12"></span> 5 how, but I had to go to work work in Amsterdam Oldst, -- eastern Amsterdam and I got a place in what was called the Cultural Mission and it was to ___. I think it was to</p><p> Iam not sure. That's the one that described in the book, and that's where I met Monfred, and that's where -- I think that's where -- that was the . Now there it was mostly, perhaps even all, and I'm not sure of that, because I didn't pay attention to it, X-German Jews. It was - - and there was -- they were a lot of communists there. And that was the first time that I ever heard the word, and that I, you know, ever came near to hearing but there was some kind of organization. What happened was I had to work -- I worked in organizing courses. God help us. Courses for people who were going to be shipped and killed and murdered in various ways which we supposedly didn't know, which -- but what I was -- which I was told by the neonple for the first time are the neonle in _ Thev told me -- the vouns neonle there <span class="page-break" number="13"></span> 6 everybody was sitting around saying we're going tomorrow and rah rah -- and Monfred said to me, "You see this guy over there, Leo Vials?" "Yes." He says, "He's not going." I said, "That's impossible." He's saying he's going. He said, "That's what you have to do. Nobody has to know that he's not going, but he's part of us. And he is not going." And then it took him about three hours to explain to me how anybody could not go, and what you'd do if you don't go. And -- and how you survive, and where do you get food. And where do you get money and -- And this was my first acquaintance with the possibility, you know, of not going. And then in my dance class -- I went after work to a dance class -- I met a fellow named and he had a friend who he told me could set me false naners. Ike came to me <span class="page-break" number="13"></span> 7 I think because I know very well that some of them escaped and some of them got out and some survived just as much I guess. Maybe a less percentage, but just as much as anybody else, which in Holland wasn't good. So for months, I tried to live with that, you know, and say, "Okay. I can't kill my family." And my father, he felt he had calmed me down. And then one night we were sitting on our big window in the living room and we were looking out. It was -- already it was curfew. There were curfews at night. And all of a sudden, we see trucks come out. Long rows of trucks. And they're starting at the at the -- at the high rise that vou saw in the nicture. On the not on the on where we lived -- <span class="page-break" number="13"></span> 8 name and the police didn't you know, they just registered me and that was it. And I lived there and that's where you have the pictures from -- the pictures of Monfred and me. They were taken in my room at that paisson. That was -- that was my first underground place.</p><p>And I even got mail. They arranged even for me to get mail so the woman wouldn't get suspicious that I was alone -- a loner and that maybe, you know, there was something wrong with me. And she got my coupons. I got food coupons, which Monfred somehow got. I had everything. I went to ballet class, a different school, of course, not -- because Alice Kayser had already been picked up, so I went to a different school and I will tell you about that school later, but in any case, I lived a relatively normal life. I was no more hungry than anybody else and -- and it wasn't so bad then anyway during that early period. And Monfred and I became verv csood friends and. vou know. | couldn't 90 to anvmore. of course. | <span class="page-break" number="14"></span> 9 school and everything. And I hadn't seen my parents for a long time. We talked over the phone. I -- I'm very homesick, very homesick. And they are -- they want to see me. Right?</p><p>And it's -- it's going to be a holiday. It's something we call ____, which I think is but I'm not sure. It was about June 18th that I went there or June 19th, 1942. And I -- Monfred says to me, "You are crazy. You should not do such a thing. You never know what's going to happen, you know." I mean nothing has been announced. He hasn't heard through his sources that anything's going to happen, but you just don't know and it's better not and why should you. You know, I had to put up a star and -- and a J to go to my -- to go home. I mean if the neighbors would see me without, you know, I mean, they would know that I was -- it was ____ It was terribly dangerous. It was stupid. It was dangerous. And I did it anyway. I -- I went to somebody's house, sewed on the J, lightly but I sewed it on, and I went to see my parents and my sister. And, of course, there was a lot of crying and there was a lot of happiness that we were still there and we were still together and it's now 1943, June 1943.</p><p>And everything goes fine that first evening and then the next morning at six, six o'clock -- in the letter that I wrote later, I write the right time a woman we used to call Cassandra came -- comes up and said, "I just heard. This whole area is closed off and we're all -- this is the big deal for this area. All the Jews are going to go. This is not a little rautsey by name. This is not by name. This is everything. Everybody!" And I was there. I was there! I was caught! I was -- I couldn't -- I mean it was terrible. At the same time, you know, I was with my family and if anything happened to them, it would happen to me and this was it, you know. And my mother said to mv father. "Frans. "which means Frans. she coes. She has to leave. <span class="page-break" number="15"></span> 0 can stop anybody. I didn't know where to go. I had no where to go. I didn't know the bridges were closed off, so I went to the bridges. And I went to the first bridge and I saw there was somebody standing in it. And then I remembered that there were people from ____ where I had worked who had good hiding places, who were communists, you know, and who would certainly hide a little blonde girl. Right? So I went there. And man, they were so angry. They told me I'm stupid. I was endangering them. How would I dare come to a house, you know, people might be watching me. I'm coming into a house -- nobody else is on the street and here's this kid walking down the street and it's coming to their house, and they have to be saved because they later on want to save Germany. Right? After the war, they want to make into a great communist country. Or anyway they want to change Germany into something good, and I was endangering them. And away with me! That was the end of my communisms if] ever had any. I'm telling you I didn't know what it was, but I -- right there, I knew that, you know, these people were no different from anybody else and it's dog eat dog and save yourself and, you know, I didn't think all of that right then. I just knew I had no place to go. All of a sudden, loud speakers all over the place. "All Jews had to prepare themselves. Gentiles are not allowed in the streets." Loud and clear. All over. And I'm in the streets. The only person in the street except for those damn people on the bridges. Right?</p><p>There were no trucks going yet, because they gave them an hour or something to get ready.</p><p>So I was the only one on the street. Of course, there were people in the windows, and they saw me. Right? I was already out of my neighborhood, so it must probable that people who saw didn't know who I was and and I'm walking along and I come to that -- to the first bridge, and there's two soldier, a green soldier, you know, and there is a black anspera_ on that bridge. And I didn't know what to say, you know. And I go up there and I say and they say, "What the Hell are you doing." I mean I had -- there was nobody there. And I said, "Well, I had come to that part of Amsterdam on the trolley in the morning to go swimming with a girlfriend. We were going out far away and -- and anyway, I tell this long story and they look and me and they say, "Boy, you are lying because no trolley has come into this section the entire morning." And I, of course, didn't know that. Trolleys start at six and I -- So they said, "If we could get off this bridge, we'd take you to the police, but we're supposed to stand here and we're only ones on the bridge and we can't go anywhere, so --" They said, "You better get away from here and go home. Go back to your girlfriend's house or something." So I went to the next bridge, and the next bridge I already know something you know. I know. And I say, "While I was staying over with a girlfriend overnight to -- to go swimming in the morning and now [ hear all this going on and I think my mother is going to be very worried about me, and I better go back home and I -- I want to get home, and I have to go over there. And -- and he said, "Like to make a date for you tonight, but right now, you know, I can't get off the bridge and you can't go over there. It's against the rules and I can't -- I can't do it." I'm getting very scared. I'm -- because it's only one more bridge that's not too far before they come in with the trucks and I -- I thought what am I going to say? What am I going to say? And I couldn't think of anything to say. And I get to the bridge and there's one German soldier. Just a young, German soldier. And, again, this total surprise, you know.</p><p>And he says, . And I'm crying. in German, you know, and I'm crying and he gets all upset. You know, he's young. He thinks I am his sister no doubt. And he says</p><p> - Where is vour mother? Where is she? And I sav "Get <span class="page-break" number="16"></span> 1 over there. Hurry!" That was it. Saved by life. Sunday, beautiful Sunday over there. People going to church. Quiet. Nothing going on. Two streets up nobody knows what's happening one street further. I go to Monfred, not to my passion because I'd said I'd be gone for several days and I don't want to suddenly show you up, you know, on a day where there is a rausea in another place, you know. So I got to Monfred's house. They are sleeping. Now, you have to know that Monfred -- he says now, he's not tied in with anything. I don't know. He always knew. He always knew what was going in -- on, and he knew nothing. He knew nothing!</p><p>They had ways to get into closed off areas. Again, there were the leather coats and the German accents and the papers. They had everything. So they tried to get over there, to get my parents, to get their friends. They couldn't. They couldn't get in. This time everything was closed up. He couldn't believe it either. He just -- we tried everything. Just everything. Of course, the phones didn't work. I heard later that the Jews just came down the steps. They just came down the steps. And they just climbed on those wagons. They helped each other up there, and they sat and they were taken away. Now, you have to know that I had many friends. I had a friend named Marie Austria, who was a photographer, my teacher -- photocoranhvy teacher later on. and her sister later on. and she lived on _ She lived <span class="page-break" number="17"></span> 2,</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Anyway, June 20th, so I went -- I went, after a few days, you know, I went back to my paission. I staved with Monfred and his mother and his sister and her fiance. They all lived <span class="page-break" number="17"></span> 3 know about their son who was receiving weapons which were dropped by the British in Holland for the resistance -- to be used by the resistance in the middle of the night -- .planes that flew low, you know, whatever it was. And he he was given away by somebody and they came to that house and they took -- they took the men. Just the men. Not my cousin, my cousin Ava. They didn't take her or the wife. And Ava was immediately put somewhere else.</p><p>But Heinz was caught and he was then sent to Westerborg as a Jew. The -- This other person -- the Gentile survived the war which was a miracle, but he had somebody who got him out in somewhere.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Let's come back to you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: To me. Okay. Well, my Uncle Heintz -- my cousin Heintz was already in -- in Westerborg, and he, of course, he saw his mother. He saw my mother. He saw my father. He saw my sister. He saw my grandmother. All going through there! And Heintz did survive the war in Westerborg. There were very, very few people who did. There were -- I think there were 300 at the end. And he was one of them who survived. And they actually kept him in the camp for a little while just to make sure he didn't happen to be -- because of his German, again, his German business. But he wasn't a German who was trying to hide as a Jew -- in a Jewish camp, which happened a heck ofa lot. I mean, any -- later on, it was the Germans who were trying to save their lives and -- and hide and -- and try to stay alive. What about me? During the war, I must say that most of the war really spent standing in line for food. Because of the way I looked I could do that. And we had -- we hid a lot of people. And that really was -- after reading the book, I realize that it was true, that what the little groups did was try to help themselves and each other staying alive. It was less a big picture, you know, that you -- that the underground would attack something or somebody, although I guess that happened, but not with us.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell us about you!</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: About me?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I'm not interested in the book right now. Okay? I want to know about you and what you did.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Okay. I stood in line for food. I also did a few other things. I was -- as -- as I say, they had to be careful with me because I was pretty stupid. And I -- they put me to work -- they put me -- I was a dancer. Right? And there was a ballet company in Amsterdan run by Evan Geeorgi, -- Evan Geeorgi who was a great dancer from somewhere in Germany, and Hamburg or Hanover -- something like that, and she was put by the Germans in into the Dutch large state theater to run the ballet company. I went into her ballet school and took classes and I was then asked to join the company. And I asked if -- the underground, "Was it alright?" "Oh, Yes!" Because you got fantastic papers when you went there -- into this company. Because the company traveled, you got papers to be out after curfew. And that way I could help shift people from one hiding place to another or like American soldiers -- shot down people other people who were underground -- . And let me tell you how this was <span class="page-break" number="18"></span> 4 done. There were no more trucks, taxis. And there were very few cars, because there was no gasoline for them to use. So what they had was people on bicycles pulling, you know, like in third world countries, they would pull little wagons behind them. Some of them were covered so that when it rained, which it does a lot in Holland, you know, people wouldn't get wet. And others were open. All sorts of various ways of transportation. And the few people that I moved were moved in the middle of the night, you know, I mean after curfew. With them being the bench and me sitting, you know, sitting like this bent over and me sitting on top on -- on sitting on their backs with a rather short skirt and my very good papers, with make-up on still from the ballet and when the Germans stuck their -- when the Dutch police stuck their head in there and saying, "What is this?" you know. Curfew is on -- you could -- I would have a smile and papers. And I shifted a lot of people. That way! You know, from one hiding place that had gotten dangerous to another one which is new, hopefully better. And I did little things like that. Also, Monfred would distribute the ____ which was the communist newspaper. Marga was distributing the __ which was the regular -- the -- the other newspaper. And I would be sent carrying bags of those with lettuce and tomatoes and carrots on top. And, again, you know I would be -- I would be told, "You bring this to a certain little portal with and just somebody will come and get it." I didn't know who was going to get it. I didn't know when they were there. If they were there before me or after me. I -- you know, I would go. I would watch the portal and if I saw somebody go into a specific corner of it, and not ring the bell or -- or, you know, whatever it was that I thought these were the right people, I would walk up with the bag. And if they took it, they were the right people. If they didn't, I would walk on. Little things like that. I also Marga's fiance -- we were constantly short of money of course. That was a big problem. And Monfred in his letter to me just now said that some money we had because some more jewelry of my -- they had a lot of jewelry that was being sold and I had little pieces left that I could sell. It was sold to Dutch people who, you know, wanted it as an investment. And the money was used for us to eat and -- and live, rent and stuff like that. Later on Leo Vial would transport Dutch workers to France. We tried to mix-up people, because the Germans were taking all the young people to Germany to work in those factories, not particularly in concentration camps, just in factories while their own people went to the various fronts. And we would mix-up these. We would have Frenchmen in Holland, and Dutchman -- and when the Germans would find them, the French would say, "We were sent here to work in -- in Holland and for the Dutch -- for the German industry," And the Dutchman in France would say, "But we were shipped here by the Germans to work for the for the French industry." I mean it was a total mix-up. Some people also would be sent, if we were lucky, would be sent through France and Spain into Portugal and would then join the Dutch Free Forces on the British 8th Brigade in England if one would be able to get there. But our Leo only took them to France. Well, on his way home he would often bring suitcases full of linsticks and --~ vou know. all these <span class="page-break" number="18"></span> 5 Thank God, not to go home. So I stood on the corner watching til they came back out and -- and they had made a mistake. Of course, they didn't. I don't know what Monfred did, but he got rid of them. And -- I mean there -- there were always -- always these horrible moments, you know, where you think, "Now, this is it. This is it." And also one time I drove -- rode my bike up a one-way street the wrong way. I..I was really confused. It was downtown and there was a lot of traffic. And I got stopped. And, of course, they looked at my papers. By that time, I had much better papers. Now, with the dancing, that ended because somebody told Evan that I was Jewish. Now she was supposedly pro-Hitler and pro this and pro that, but she knew that I was Jewish and she never did anything about it. Never! She called -- did call me in and she said, "It would be better if you had a little more training before you go on further trips." She put that very well. She never said, you know, "I put you into this company because you were so good and what the Hell have you done to me?" She said exactly what I told you. She said, "A little more training would be good for you, so just go to school." So that she -- you know, wouldn't be endangered and I would be must less endangered. And the strange thing was that she had been told by people who were actually watching out for me.</p><p>Was a different sroun of neonle. It was Maria Austria and her friend. --~ who are all in <span class="page-break" number="19"></span> 6 Tape #3</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Now we go. You were going to tell us a little more about your underground activities, particularly in smuggling packages?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I didn't smuggle. I sent them by mail. The Germans would let you send packages to people in Westerborg, and I managed during the nine months that my parents were there -- I managed to send a lot of packages. And I was always collecting things, you know, as I went along.</p><p>And, of course, we had ration coupons so it was hard, and I always got letters back. Actually, we had mail from there. Regular mail -- .regular mail from my parents. And the mail I guess was read, but it was sent on. And they received everything I sent. Nothing was dis -- had disappeared. I also want to say that, you know, when they were taken away that I never knew that they were in Auschwitz. I didn't know where they had gone. I heard they had been sent on, and that was it. And it now appears that it was in January of "44. And it was -- it was a terrible shock. It was just really incredible shock. And I also want to say that I think I survived because I was 17 or you know, by that time 19. It's the sort and it was exciting, you know, this living alone and not knowing -- everyday it was something else, and not knowing what was going to happen. The drudgery, you know, of trying to get food and of survival and -- Okay. At 19 they felt I was getting old enough to do some other things also. You know, since I couldn't be in the ballet anymore, I had to be good for something. And besides standing in line for food, which was hard in the winter in the rain and in the cold I can tell you. We took care of a lot of other people who were underground who could not be out. I mean from the point of view of -- I didn't particularly see these people, but I had to supply food, you know, get food for them. Somebody made me or helped me -- I forgot how, but I rented an apartment. Was the same apartment with the same street, the 91, you know, where we had been before. This was now an 86. was on the second floor of 80 -- number 86 in the Valarastratt. We might have just heard that it was coming free, you know, because we were right there in the neighborhood. Anyway, it was rented under my name my false name, of course. And then a very difficult time started. Very difficult! First of all, we went into the hunger winter. You know the time that the south was liberated, south being Braba -- north Braba. and all those. And that onlv did provinces around were still occunied and <span class="page-break" number="20"></span> 7 on, you know, if they did have a rautsea_, if they did have a check into various apartments, they would stick their bayonets into the walls and into the floors and, you know, looking for people. And There was one guy which was assigned to our -- to my apartment where I lived with Monfred and with various other people of the group whoever was around at the time.</p><p>And this man was, I think, a Czech -- Czechish communist. And he would give lectures in our apartment and we weren't allowed to have more than three or four people, so this very scary, and I started to be very scared. And, first of all, I didn't like what he said and I said to Mon, "You know, I do not want this anymore. This is my apart -- you know, I hired under my name and I would -- I'm responsible and it's dangerous. And these people, they will tell on us. And Monfred said, It's nothing to be done. We have to have him." He also had to have his wife on weekends. So she was hidden somewhere else. RIght? But on weekends, she came to our place. And one day this -- this one woman and I who took care of the apartment were told that the Germans were going to check into place, and in several in the neighborhood. So we had to move him. We had to move him. And we moved him at night some -- to another apartment -- another place. And then we had to clean up to see that they didn't see that there had been a man anywhere, because there was supposed to be two women living in this apartment. So we started -- we went into his apartment -- into his room and he had left everything. Cigars! First of all, how did he have cigars? Nobody had cigars. Apples!</p><p>Foods! Cheese! We didn't give it to him. How did he get it? And when -- finally when all this was over, you know, the Germans never did come to visit -- to us to check up, but when it was all over, I said to my friend, "I do not want this guy." It's terrible. 1 mean he was a hoarder, somebody who hoarded things. We were supposed to share everything, you know.</p><p>This was very important. And he was a communist. He should know how to share. Anyway, he -- I told Monfred, "he has to go." And Monfred got very, very angry. They beat up on me because they were so angry that I would, you know, and I -- and they said, "Well, what can you do to us. You can't do anything anything to us." I said -- and I stupid -- my old stupid, I said, "Yes, I can go to the police." Can you believe it? I was just impossibly stupid. I mean I was so desperate. You know I thought we're all going to be caught. You know, we're all -- and -- and I'll never forget that guy. It was awful, and his red headed wife. Impossible! So anyway, those are -- were some of the adventures, you know, during the -- and, of course, the Americans -- New Year's Eve -- American soldiers, who had to be hidden, you know, from -- they would be shot down by the Germans over -- the -- the -- the planes would come flying. They were full of bombs, you know. And on the way home, he might have a bomb left. And they would drop a bomb. They would just drop the bomb -- the -- the Americans.</p><p>So sometimes the Germans got one of those planes, and we got somebody to hide -- English, American, whatever. New Year's Eve, the American went on the roof and shot off his gun. I mean I'm sorry. Ohhhh! So -- uh -- then the -- the hunger got so great that the -- and we got to the end -- toward the end, you know, the Germans knew -- toward the end. And they let the Red Cross drop food in Amsterdam -- in and around Amsterdam. And the Red Cross -- we had flat roofs. You know, the roofs in Amsterdam behind the decorations are flat. So they dropped cases of food on the roofs or in the parks or in open space, and the Germans were so scared by that time they didn't dare to pick them up. And the underground and -- I -- the food was distributed evenly, you know. You had to give whatever -- if you found one on your roof, you know, you better take it. And we were all starving. We were really -- the bread was <span class="page-break" number="21"></span> 8 -- had gone sour. We ate everything, you know, that -- that they dropped. And then the -- we heard that the Canadians were coming to liberate us. I haven't told you about Akmier.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I'd like you to go back and tell us about Akmier.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Okay. Well, toward the end of the war, I kept hearing about a man man Almier who was a German, and who did fantastic things for the underground, the Dutch underground. And Monfred said one day that Akmier's place of hiding was not very good and Akmier should, perhaps, if it was alright -- it was my apartment -- right? -- Akmier should come to us. Well, Akmier came to visit -- to see if that was alright. Well we also arranged a girl for him to come that he might like. We wanted him to come because it was dangerous for him. We didn't want him to get into trouble. Now it turned out that -- that he was -- he really had to stay where he was he felt for a little while. And the underground came to him to Monfred and said you have to get him out of there because if he is -- when we get liberated, if he is where he is now, we might have to send him back to Germany or anyway he'll be in deep trouble. And so they sent me to get him. And I went over there I said you have to come and stay us and you have to come. You have to come. So Akmier came. And then I heard his whole story. He -- he was a German -- was involved in a Munich story where the six people were hanged. Six students -- they turned over a whole suitcase full of pamphlets on -- on an assembly in -- of Munich University full of anti-Hitler propaganda. And in one -- of course, they all got caught. I mean it was very early on and nobody knew what to do. So -- so in one of their books was his name? -- in one of his -- the notebooks, address books was his name, and somehow they managed to get him out of Germany. He had just finished his medical studies and he was sent to Villemina Hot Towers in Amsterdam, which is a mental institution and hospital in Amsterdam, and he was supposed to study further psychiatry. He wanted to go into psychiatry. So he studied there and worked there, and he started working with the underground. And he -- he's the one -- one of the people who supplied us with all the serums -- of in..inoculations, of all the diseases you caught during the war. He got us a piece of soap once in awhile. He he helped people. He moved people from one place to -- he did a whole lot probably that I don't even know about. And then the Germans shifted him to France because there were big battles going on in France, and they needed psychiatrists -- some people to help. And in France and once -- once he got there, the situation was so disastrous that he was supposed to tell the soldiers it was worthwhile fighting for Germany.</p><p>It was worthwhile fighting. And he saw -- he couldn't do that It was idiotic. It was ridiculous to fight. And one of the lucky things, then -- more or less, lucky -- was terrible for him -- was that they needed surgeons worse than they needed psychiatrists in the end you know. And he was made to work sewing up these left over pieces of flesh and he absolutely lost his mind. He just couldn't. That was not his nature. He couldn't stand -- stand it. And so toward V-J day, he had a little Fiat -- little thing, you know, that they had the one -- for one person like bug, they used to call little bug, and he got in it and he -- he rode. He got to Beloium and there were Germans there and thev nainted bio white zeros. circles on -- <span class="page-break" number="22"></span> 9 lot of cars with big white zeros and there were men and women standing up against the cars being shot, one after the other. Deserters. Shooting the deserters! He didn't have a zero on his car, and he made to Holland. And in Holland, he called the underground and the underground -- the car had broken down so he had to walk a little bit. And in Holland the -- the underground brought him a suit, took his and buried it -- his uniform and buried it, and took him to Amsterdam and hid him. And Akmier did a little bit of work, but not too much then because he could -- what could he do, you know. He was, himself, endangered. And -- and then after the wa, Akmier stayed in Holland. He got this -- you know, the Queen said he was a guy and he could stay -- a good German, and he was -- he was really very marvelous.</p><p>But he had a lot of damage done to his physic during the war, and he never, you know, he just -- he was a psychiatrist and just -- just by himself you know. He didn't -- he worked as a psychiatrist, but not -- he doesn't share. He doesn't -- I often I always asked him, you know, "Don't you share with others? Don't you discuss your cases with others, don't you?" "Uh- huh." Nothing. Nothing. Just sit. And</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You and Akmier became involved.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We became very involved, but in the end I decided to come to the States anyway. No, I -- I wanted children and Akmier did not want children. He said, "This is not a world" -- this is one of the things that was done to him. I mean, what happened to him. He couldn't get passed it, shall we say. He said this is not a world for -- for any children. And he ended up marrying a woman who already had a child and couldn't have anymore. I mean he really looked for somebody like that and he found somebody who was divorced and had the kind of blood disease that she couldn't have any more children then. He -- he -- it was terrible. It really was so sad. And he -- he had such talent. You know, he played the violin, and he was very well educated. His father was an incredible person. His father -- there were three sons. Now let me iust sav that because vou have to hear something sood about Germans. His father <span class="page-break" number="23"></span> 0 last. You might have already have heard about that where the underground had been able to absolutely -- and was not able to do anything because it -- you know -- it -- and they were so frustrated. I mean they did do things like shoot a soldier -- shoot -- shoot somebody, you know, or -- or blow up some trains. I -- I guess they did some things like that, you know. But they had all these weapons. And they hadn't been able to get their hands on the Germans, and they really wanted that. And in Amsterdam, you know, we knew the -- the Canadians were coming and -- and everybody went downtown to the Dom, which is the big place in front of the town. And on the Dam also was the German officer's Club, right -- I mean the Palace of the Queen is, shall we say, to the north and officer's club just a little street apart, maybe 10 feet, 12 feet. There was the German Officers Club. And who was in this club? Old guys and boys of 15! I mean really the Germans had nobody left that, so the -- some how somebody had a big shotgun in -- in the Palace -- the underground had a big shotgun and shot into the club. And, of course, the Germans then had to fight and I think since there were so many people standing right there in the Dom, I think 147 people died -- and -- and I -- many Germans died. I mean it was totally useless. It was one of those things that happened in total confusion and fear on both sides, fear and loathing on both sides, and just a horrible, stupid, awful thing. Well, during that period we were getting sort of ready. You knew you could already go on the streets. You knew you didn't have to be as afraid. And they were coming.</p><p>And they did come. They came. And I remember looking at the trucks coming and full of these healthy pink and blond and blue and black-eyed guys. I -- I thought our -- our guys were great looking, you know. I'd never seen so much flesh. I mean it was incredible. And, of course, we went out there and screamed. We just screamed. And all my dance buddies, you know, my ballet -- my friends, they all -- I heard all of them -- they all had boyfriends.</p><p>They all got boyfriends, and this and that. I, of course, had a friend and I did not. I had always been scared to death of any kind of soldiers, so I never had anything to do with any kind of soldier. Anyway, gun carrying, uniformed person. It was awful. It was -- I mean it was wonderful. It was heavenly, and it was scary. Very, very scary! Because I didn't really know where I belonged then, you know. I knew I had -- I had immediately withdrawn because I got into the ballet. The ballet 1945 was started right then. It had already been started for a whole month before that, and we had rehearsed to get ready for -- for the ballet.</p><p>But then it really started and I started to work nearly immediately after the war was over in the Ballet 1945. Then later we came to the States. Ballet Comnanv. crew out of that. <span class="page-break" number="24"></span> 1 than cold. It was terribly cold. We would take -- there was six of us or seven of us in the apartment -- we would go all in one bed and put everybody's blankets and mattresses on top of us and we still were cold, you know. And eat a hard tack before getting up, and then only cold water to wash with. And, of course, after -- right after -- oh, we had no coal to heat -- heat the stove, which by the way was the only thing to cook on. Remember gas wasn't there anymore. So we got -- Monfred had a big __ he got a lot of peach from outside and -- and we brought -- we had a whole room, small room, storage room full of peat. And we used the peat to -- to cook on the stove which was just a little heating, which also heated the room.</p><p>And that peat was full of fleas and we had a flea plague on top of the cold and the hunger.</p><p>And one night I caught 84 fleas. I killed 84 fleas. 1 mean we were covered, and actually we didn't get rid of it til the Americans gave us some DDT, which was brand new then. I mean I don't think there even. I mean it was just in total disaster. We were hungry, cold, and full of fleas by the end of the war. It was outrageous. And then there was this wonderful festival where they made fires everywhere and they had -- I don't know where they got lights, but at night we had lights and boats were laid across the canals and you could walk from one side from one __ to the other just over -- over the boat. I was in love. And it was wonderful. It was the most wonderful -- wonderful day in my -- I can ever remember. And I didn't think -- I didn't let myself think about my parents and my -- for that one day. And then afterwards, I said, "Now what? Now what?" And then we started hearing that -- oh, they are lists. They are lists of people who were coming back, and your mother is on one of the lists. Well, Monfred said to me then, "Don't believe it." And I -- I already hated him with a passion.</p><p>Right? Because he had done all these horrible things. And he said, "Don't believe it." And I said, "I'm going to believe it." We then knew -- we knew about concentration camps. In "45.</p><p>So I started going to the train stations. And, of course, I stood there. When I had the time, I stood there and I stood there and I stood there. I asked -- and when I see these films, you know, they are films made by the French. They were wonderful French films, but and -- and they're these people going to -- other people coming out of trains, you know, and they have their shaved and they looked awful and there are these people coming back from camps and you ask -- that's how it was -- and you asked, did you know so and so? Did you know so and son? No. No. No. Now I think that one of those people was somebody took my mother's name to get back to Holland. I'm sure of it. And recently somebody showed up with my sister's name. And, of course, when I started looking, she was gone. I mean there was nobody to find. And it's the same sort of thing and then I started waving goodbye to people. I had girlfriends who met Americans and who married them. And I started seeing people who were not good and women who were not good in the war. And I was waving goodbye to them because they were marrying American soldiers. What do the American soldiers know?</p><p>They know nothing! And if they had known, what would it have mattered? They were in love. You know, such is human nature.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: We need to move. Can you tell me just tell me what, very briefly, what you did now and -- .</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, after the war, of course, I -- I worked for two years in the Ballet. I danced. That's how I make money. And I started to realize that every time I got a job, they had to ask for a work permit because I was not a Dutch citizen. And it was a lot of work for them and bless them, <span class="page-break" number="25"></span> 2 they did it. I mean I did not -- I thought I wouldn't have done it. I can get another girl, you know. But I always had a job. And Akmier, of course, was working by that time, and so we managed. But when I decided -- a friend of my family Lotta Kalinaski, also from Berlin who was -- is quite a well known psychiatrist here in the States I think -- .I went for shock treatments and things. And Lotta was looking for my parents. I had gone to my older apartment -- our -- our apartment where I lived with my family and had told the woman there where I was living and to please forward any mail that she would get and to please let me look in the hiding places that we had around the house. And, of course, she'd found the hiding places. There was nothing there. And then the woman below us, who was a fascist during the war, she said, "I saw you got on -- you know, it was dangerous for her -- dangerous period for her. She might have been shipped to Germany or killed by the where all the Dutch wanted to take revenge on their people -- and she said, "I didn't give you away when you ran away. You helped me." And I said, "You were helped enough." Because she had a lot of our stuff, and I didn't get anything back. So I -- I said, "I won't give you away, just like you didn't give me away." And that was all I ever did for her. I didn't give her away. I said, "If they catch on to you, that's not my fault. I don't -- you know, it's your." Anyway, I got a -- I got a lot of mail from all over the world, from Australia, from Canada, from America, from -- all -- all over the world where people had managed to escape to. And one of the letters I got was from the Kanaski's and they asked me to come to the States. At the time I was in the Ballet and I was with Akmier and I thought Akmier would get over the fact that he didn't want to have children, which I knew I had to have children. So I said to Kanaski, let's wait. Let's wait. He said, "T'll give you an affidavit and you come." And he kept coming by because he -- he went to Berlin to lecture. He helped set up the free university of Berlin as psychiatry -- department of psychiatry there, and giving lectures. So he came every year two or three times and he said, "Now you must come." And made -- he sent me the affidavit and made me sign it, and by that time I thought it would be better and that's how I came to the States. He was very -- they were very good to me -- very good to me. And I also have other family here. They were also good to me. So -- and I worked as a ballet -- as a dancer. And that's it!
