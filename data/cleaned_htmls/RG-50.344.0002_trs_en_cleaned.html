<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They were very close together.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm. And you worked at both?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, Gusen.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, only Gusen? Oh, I'm confused then, I thought you were at Mauthausen.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, maut -- well, as I remember Mauthausen was only where the -- there was an inf- infantry group that was in there, men, and they had the prisoners there. I don't think there was a hospital up there. I don't remember it if there was.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And were they bringing then the survivors, the patients who'd been in Mauthausen, were they bringing them down to where you were in Gusen?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. I don't remember a camp -- as -- the DP's, what have you? No, that's displaced person. But I don't remember them bringing anybody down. If they did, I don't remember it.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And what -- what became of those people over time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I don't know, cause they were still there when we left. Cause when we went in -- when the men went in, the Germans had released them and they were out in the fields and they had to go get them and bring them back. Because I remember they were digging in the fields and ate raw potatoes and it made them deathly ill, because they weren't used to</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> eating. And when they did feed them, they'd always save part of it under their pillow, for fear they wouldn't get anything any more. And there was some musicians there and they used to play at mealtime, up on the stage, the ones that were able to play while we ate.</p><p>But I don't remember eating in that dining room. We were talking about a lot of things. I remember that I -- remember --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Di -- Were you ever able to have conversations with those people at all?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. I never did, no.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh. And they were in -- they had suffered the same kinds of things?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Mm-hm, mm-hm. They tell you there was a -- nearby there was a munitions factory, in the mountain, inside the mountain.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Where the -- the people used to go in there to work. As long as they were able to walk, they had to go there to work. They went there from the camp to work. Then there was</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion</p><p> also places where they actually made lampshades there out of s -- human skin. And the -- the big furnaces were there where they'd -- whew it's hot there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Want to take a break?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Where they burned the bodies.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- the layout.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, I can't remember. All I can remember seeing that big oven with the doors open.</p><p>There was -- if I remember rightly, there was three of them. Did they tell you about the SS trooper that they killed? The -- we had natives, or whatever you want to call them -- natives -- people that lived in the town came in to work afterwards. They worked in the kitchens and in the dining room and what have you. And there was one German SS man and those prisoners, who were nothing but skin and bone, killed him and hung him up on a fence. I have a picture of that at home.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you see it happen?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. And there was -- the chaplain and his assistant doing all the burials you know, and they had big, long trenches with bodies in long, long lines.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Every day?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: See, a lot of them died at first. As a matter of fact, you couldn't tell the live ones from the dead ones, they looked -- that's how bad they looked.</p></p></dialogue>

It's up to you, whatever you want to do."</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did he tell you what it was going to be like?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Ifhe did I don't remember.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was -- were you shocked when you got there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, sure. When you don't know the difference between a live person and a dead one, it's pretty awful. Grisly.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: When you got out of the service, what -- and in your later life, what -- what do you think has been the impact of that experience on your life or --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I can remember I was in Atlanta, going down to see a friend. And we went to the movies and there happened to be -- remember -- oh, you don't remember. There was newsreels then. And one of the newsreels showed the -- a concentration camp and a guy behind us said, "That's all propaganda, that never happened at all."</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: An American guy?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And that, you know, that disturbed me a little. They had to hold me in my seat, because I was ready to get up and punch the person, but -- and then even now, you hear people say it didn't happen, but it did. Very much so.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Do you have family members [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Mm-hm.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Do they ask --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [have one son in the Air Force and one son in the Army.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did they ask you about your experience a lot?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, they've seen my pictures and what have you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You took a lot of pictures while you were there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [had a lot, real lot and somebody said, "Well I'll print them for you, I'll have them cop -- printed for you." I never saw them. I lost about six rolls of 36 -- 35 millimeter film.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Before you got back?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Mm-hm. When we -- I had to go on an inspection trip in -- in France while they were setting up the hospital, getting things going, I went on an inspection trip with two or three other officers. And I took a lot of pictures then, all through Germany, all the devastation that was on. That was before the war was over. As a matter of fact, I was in the hospital in -- in Brussels, what was the name of the place? Can't remember now, but I'm sitting down to eat in this dining room. Woman next to me said, "Aren't you Margaret Wood?" "Yes." She was one of my teachers in school. She was a Red Cross worker. Another time in France, walking down the street, a boy I went to school with was there. Twice I ran into people in -- three times, once in England.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When you look back on that experience, was it a good experience or a hard experience, or how do you characterize it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was good and it was hard.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was good about it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: The things you saw, the people you met, the things you did, your experiences, your friends. We've all been back and forth for years, so --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You've kept in touch with a lot of the women that you served with?</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Mm-hm. Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. When you say the -- the things you saw, s -- one of the good things about your experience was the things you saw. What do you mean by that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Maybe other cultures and the way other people live and the things that we have that they don't have. That type of thing. The beautiful buildings that were left, the beautiful cathedrals that you saw. I remember going to mass and -- this was back in Africa. We went in to mass and we sat down, but you don't do that, because everybody has their own pew, their own chair. They bring their own chair and their own kn-kneeling benches, so were sitting in somebody else's seat [indecipherable] sort of. It wasn't the same in England. I don't remember going to church in any place else except for -- we went in churches and saw the cathedrals -- some of the cathedrals and things. Those were beautiful things.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did they hold services every week?</p></p></dialogue>

And if I remember rightly, they had a mass or -- in Gusen that they never -- they hadn't had one in years and everybody went, you know, that could. All the inmates went. I never can think of what to call them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah, yeah. Patients I would --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Survivors, [indecipherable] yeah. Is there anything you want to say?

<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I can't think of any.</p></p></dialogue>
