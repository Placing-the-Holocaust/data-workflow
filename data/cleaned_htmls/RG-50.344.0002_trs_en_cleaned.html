The -- we had natives, or whatever you want to call them -- natives -- people that lived in the town came in to work afterwards. They worked in the kitchens and in the dining room and what have you. And there was one German SS man and those prisoners, who were nothing but skin and bone, killed him and hung him up on a fence. I have a picture of that at home.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you see it happen?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [had a lot, real lot and somebody said, "Well I'll print them for you, I'll have them cop -- printed for you." I never saw them. I lost about six rolls of 36 -- 35 millimeter film.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Before you got back?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Mm-hm. When we -- I had to go on an inspection trip in -- in France while they were setting up the hospital, getting things going, I went on an inspection trip with two or three other officers. And I took a lot of pictures then, all through Germany, all the devastation that was on. That was before the war was over. As a matter of fact, I was in the hospital in -- in Brussels, what was the name of the place? Can't remember now, but I'm sitting down to eat in this dining room. Woman next to me said, "Aren't you Margaret Wood?" "Yes." She was one of my teachers in school. She was a Red Cross worker. Another time in France, walking down the street, a boy I went to school with was there. Twice I ran into people in -- three times, once in England.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When you look back on that experience, was it a good experience or a hard experience, or how do you characterize it?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. When you say the -- the things you saw, s -- one of the good things about your experience was the things you saw. What do you mean by that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Maybe other cultures and the way other people live and the things that we have that they don't have. That type of thing. The beautiful buildings that were left, the beautiful cathedrals that you saw. I remember going to mass and -- this was back in Africa. We went in to mass and we sat down, but you don't do that, because everybody has their own pew, their own chair. They bring their own chair and their own kn-kneeling benches, so were sitting in somebody else's seat [indecipherable] sort of. It wasn't the same in England. I don't remember going to church in any place else except for -- we went in churches and saw the cathedrals -- some of the cathedrals and things. Those were beautiful things.</p></p></dialogue>

And if I remember rightly, they had a mass or -- in Gusen that they never -- they hadn't had one in years and everybody went, you know, that could. All the inmates went. I never can think of what to call them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah, yeah.
