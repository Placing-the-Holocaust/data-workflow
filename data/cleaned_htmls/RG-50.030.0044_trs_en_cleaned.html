<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: OK. Growing up in Sochocin...it was a very small town. I would say about 2 thousand people the most. My father was an industrialist. We had a pearl button factory. All the raw material we imported from Germany or Iran...pearl shells...and I still remembered which I did translating my narrative that we had bought at the last time in Hamburg, Germany, it O.A.Sanithousen. And I wrote to them when I needed for the restitution. I needed some information; and they gave me...they wrote me a letter that my father indeed bought from them material. Also I remembered that my father bought some; machinery from...uh. from Vienna and I remembered the name of Mr. Ferdinand Eberall, and I wrote to them...I wrote to Vienna, and I got a response from them that my father indeed bought the machinery from them. So I have the authentic letters which I gave to Susan in my...in my narrative.</p></p></dialogue>

Very small. And my father had there a pearl button factory. I went to school there and...uh...we had...uh...between 100 and 120 people in the season in the factory. My father was very successful and I must say in those circumstances then, we were wealthy people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell me about the factory. You had started to tell me that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The factory was, uh, in a...in a special house not far from where we lived and we had, as I said, about 100...120 people employed. We imported our raw materials, which was shells, pearl shells from Germany and sometimes from Persia, which was then... which is now Iran.</p><p>Most of them was...were imported from Germany...from the firm O.A. Sanithousen in. I can't, remember now the town. It just escapes me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Doesn't matter.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And, uh, the machinery and some knives and all the things that we needed to produce the buttons were from Austria from Vienna and the the name that I remember was Mr.</p><p>Ferdinand Eberall and Windbeaer Strabser in Vienna. And when I did file for freedom restitution, the Germans needed some confirmation that my father indeed was buying from them material, the raw material and the machinery. I got in touch with O.A. Sanithousen. I got a letter of confirmation from them that indeed my father did buy the raw materials from them. I got a confirmation. I wrote to Mr. Ferdinand Eberall and I got several letters from them confirming that my father indeed bought machinery before 1939 and I have the letters and I put into my narrative as the originals.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: OK. Tell me...let's go back to the town. Tell me about your family. I would like to know about your parents and what they were like.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. Okay. We lived in a house which I saw 2 years ago. I was in Poland. It was my grandmother's house, but my father as the oldest...in the Jewish religion he was a Cohen. He got half of the house and we lived in that house. The other half...was occupied by my grandmother. Her name was Galek--G-A-L-E K--which is my maiden name. She had like a country store and you got the...you could buy anything from soup to nuts, there....everything.</p><p>People used to come from...the farmers from the villages... Every Thursday was market day, and they came and bought all the stuff that they needed from my grandmother. She had a big bakery also. And everything was included there. And when I was there 2 years ago in Poland, I saw... wanted to see the bakery and I found a man who worked there and unfortunately, they transferred...transformed it now to a big office. Okay. I am going back to my grandmother. We were 13 grandchildren and everything was around my grandmother's house. Everybody gathered there for holidays and it was a big thing to go to grandmother.</p><p>Her name was Zelda Mottel Galek. OK. And everybody knew in the...in the village...in this little town...everybody knew Mrs. Galkowa. This is Polish. My grandfather wasn't then alive anymore and I never knew my grandmother...my grandfather. Uh...my...we were, as I said, we were very well # +f off. We had...the house had like three tiers...three floors and the</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And, uh, we had...I had a very very happy childhood. I attended a school...the public school which was Polish. There were very few Jews. Very few Jews lived in that town...very few...and, uh, we had a synagogue in the town and my father was...he wasn't exactly religious. We didn't keep a kosher home or anything like that and most of our friends were some of the Jews, but mostly were the Poles.</p><p>Really. Especially I was very friendly with the...with the children of the director of the school and I was there...we were the only ones from my family that attended school on Saturday...but the other Jews did not attend Saturday school because it was against their religion. So just to tell you 20 H that we were...we were very good, conscientious Jews but never observed kashrut or something like that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You had sisters and brothers?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I had 3 sisters, 2 which perished in the concentration camp. The third one still lives in Israel.</p><p>She left just...a few months before the war broke out, she left for Israel. And I a periodically see her. I go to Israel. My parents, unfortunately, were murdered there in front of me, in the ghetto. My 2 sisters perished in concentration camp which I thought before I die, I wanted to see that where it was, and I went 2 years ago. It was my daughter's 40th birthday, and I gave them a gift. I took the whole family, my daughter, my son-in-law, my grandson and myself.</p><p>My husband already was disabled and he couldn't go. And, uh, we saw Oswiecim.</p><p>Auschwitz, and we saw all the atrocities and it was very painful, very hard, but I am glad that we did take them, because I did want the children to know something about my youth, where I lived and what happened. So I was very glad that I could do that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Let's go back.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I want to go back to your childhood still. You have described the town. You have described your family a bit. Tell me a bit about your mother. I have...I would like a picture of your mother and a picture of your father. What were they like?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. My mother was a very bright, very intelligent person. She was a hat designer when she met my father and then she gave it up. She was a very devoted mother and took very very good care of us children and she instilled in us the value of Judaism and even though we were not, you know, as I told you not kashrut and all that, but very conscientious Jews. And, uh, she was a very pleasant person, very well liked by everybody, and when I met people 2 years ago in Poland, they still remember her and they still remember her and they still remember Fela and they still remembered one woman who went together with my sister in Israel to school and they remember the whole family as a very loving, very caring family and especially also about my grandmother. They loved her. And I was...I had a very happy childhood. I...we...I belonged to the Zionist organization and we had, uh, uh...what is it called...an organization...a youth organization which worked solely for Israel. And I was</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> very active in that, and as a matter of fact, as a product of that my sister went to Israel. She did not want to remain in Poland. She was a very devoted Zionist and she went to Israel. And my childhood was very, very happy. I was always very well dressed, very well taken care of and really living in opulence. We had maids. In the morning we got our first breakfast at 7:00 in the...in the bed. At 9 O'clock we had our breakfast before we left for I f~g school and, uh, at about 2 O'clock we came back from school. We had our big dinner, went back afterwards from 3:00 to 6:00 to school again and I also had Hebrew after school and...uh...twice a week.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was that unusual for girls at that time? For girls to learn Hebrew?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was not in that town because most of the girls belonged to the youth organization and to the Zionist organization and we were all very much introduced to Hebrew. And I spoke very fluently Hebrew at one time. I still read and I understand pretty much, but with talking I have a little bit problem, but when I was in Israel, you know, you pick it up.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Let's stay in Poland. Okay. Pre-war Poland. How did all of /this life change when the Germans came in? When did they come into your town?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: OK. To my town, I wasn't there anymore because at certain point we moved to Warsaw.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When did you move to Warsaw?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The factory was still in Sochocin in Poland, but we moved. About 5 years before the war broke out we moved to Poland.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: To Warsaw?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: To Warsaw. Yes. And we lived on Lesno 24 in Poland. It was a beautiful building and we loved Warsaw because my... my father was about three times a week in Warsaw doing business. People came from all over Poland and they came to trade in Warsaw. We had, uh...uh...some customers Tomaszow, in Krakow, in Radowicze (ph) and I remember certain, certain places where my father sold buttons to them, but all the selling was done in Warsaw.</p><p>It was like a market, like a Chicago...you know...so...uh...and, as I said, I knew only really good things, beautiful things, and in Warsaw, we had a chance to . . .to go to theatres and concerts and we were exposed very much to the arts then in Warsaw, which we didn't have a chance in...in the little town. So my youth was a happy youth and...and...uh...it was wonderful. And then came the Germans</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When did they come? How old were you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Okay. I was about almost 19 years when I first started... when a we moved to Warsaw...I started college university... Warsaw Colleges University of Warsaw. Just registered when the war broke out in September. I remember like today my father had a very bad premonition</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Well, in Poland if somebody was wealthy, had not only money, but had gold. Okay? Well, we had some gold. We had some gold dollars and lots of gold. He took us together and he said he felt that this is going to be a terrible war. He said g to us we will divide whatever we have. The money was no good anymore, but the gold and the...uh...whatever we have in jewelry, gold jewelry, we'll divide equally to everyone of [Page 11 you...of us...whoever...I remember these words...whoever can save themselves with what he has should do so and at that time, he really divided all the among all of us. Needless to say, it was a terrible moment because we knew from newspapers from before what the Germans are like. And shortly after, the war broke out when they took over Poland. After a little while they started organizing, put all the Jews in certain streets. It was, I remember, Zamenhof which was mostly Jewish, really, Malewki uh, there was another street I don't remember very well anymore, but we were all concentrated in these few streets...all the Jews were put in to wherever we could.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What were living conditions like in the ghettos?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The conditions in the beginning, we thought, might be okay. But as we went on, we didn't have enough food; we didn't have enough water; we didn't have enough of anything, and that's when the problems started. Sicknesses started to evolve because we didn't have enough of anything. Okay?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Where were you living?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We were living in one room. There were about 12 of us. We didn't have any beds. Whatever we could take was on the floor. Okay. Whatever we had. The few things that we could take along with us because you had to leave most of it, you had to leave where you where and just...just go.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You had been rounded up before you were taken to the ghetto?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Everybody was rounded up, and you know, I remember they used to take the male Jews to see if they were...what do you say...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Circumcised?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Circumcised. And by that they saw who was Jewish because most of the Poles...the Jews in Poland...were circumcised. And that's how they rounded us up. From wherever we lived we had to go to a certain point in Warsaw and they...they brought every...all the Jews to these few...uh...streets and then they put sort of...uh...like a barbed wire...we were having some things that you couldn't move around easily out...and 30 that's how it started. Well, this started around the end of right away as they came. And I lived in the ghetto until 41. At 41, it was really, really before the ghetto was set a fire it started to become real bad. People were murdered. People were just taken out for no reason at all and just killed, especially children were just thrown against the wall...just killed. Well, at one point they rounded us up all and</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> they had lines you stay here you stay here you stay there. At that time we were already...the people started to get separated from their families. If somebody looked well to them enough to be transported to work, which I thought was work, was in one line. People were sickly looking...meekly looking, they went in another line. Elderly parents went in another line. The people that looked too sick to them, they just took care of them right away. Like my parents were, at that time, really very bad looking, and they just shot them right then and there. And not only my parents but a lot of them. I was in the line and I tried to run out to help but I was pushed back. You couldn't do anything. My sisters were younger than I. They took them to, to a younger line. I was in the older line. However, somehow I got out of that line and I tried to hide. I got out of that line and I was able to get to a hiding place which I hide...I hid. That's how I got out. When the ghetto was set afire...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No. No. No. I don't want to go there yet. I want you to S 6 tell me about the hiding. How did you get to the hiding place?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I tell you now L...I cannot explain to you how it happened, but there was another Jewish girl with me and we decided that we are not going to let ourselves being taken. The girl....I have a picture of her too. The girl was named Alla and, uh, we tried...we made up our minds we are not going to let ourselves be taken by the Germans, and as they shoved us aside we shoved ourselves further away and we got away from them. And we hid out a little bit for a few days. This was...all that happened shortly before the ghetto was set afire. They wanted really to exterminate the Jews. Whoever was left to set afire, and they couldn't get out. And we somehow got away from that line and got away from it. And when we got away from it and, we hid out a couple of days when they announced the ghetto is going to be set afire.</p><p>And Alla and I were in that hiding place.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What hiding place? Describe it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was like a little alley between two houses. We somehow got in between that alley and stood there, waited until all the people were taken. You know they took everybody by...uh...uh...cars like they transport...transport animals, you know, trucks like...animal trucks. And everybody was pushed, shoved on the trucks...whoever was taken was supposed to be taken to Germany to work they said. But it wasn't to t~&gt; work unfortunately. It was the camp.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Where were your sisters taken?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And we were both still in that little alley. Well, when it got quiet, we just maneuvered around and we maneuvered around to a park where there was...uh...uh...we could stay there for a while, and we stood there not knowing what are we going to do next. Well, we stood there and we scrounged around for food wherever we could, because the Germans had the idea that time that nobody is left, and if somebody is left they couldn't get at them, and that's why they decided to set afire...also because there were a lot of Jews that were underground.</p><p>We somehow got to these underground people. From that...</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: From the park?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: From that park where we're there. After the Germans left, the underground people somehow came...came up from wherever they were...they were hiding in the underground and got hold of us.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What year are we? You were talking 19...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: This is all...this is...this is 1941.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You are still in 1941?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. Because we were...until 1941, we...this was the beginning of 1941. The ghetto was set afire in March.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And somehow this was all shortly before the ghetto was set afire. So from nowhere the people from underground showed up and they found the two of us and they took us. And they took us...when they...they took us to their underground where they were hiding and kept us. At that time 2 days later, the ghetto was set afire.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Hold it. I don't want to get there. I want you to describe for me please where they took you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>What was it like?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't know where they took us. I don't even know where it was. It was somewhere around the ghetto and maybe it was in the ghetto, but wherever they came up from I have no idea. 1 Probably 1943. They were...they just there...like this Pole I found in Warsaw....from nowhere he came.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: They took you in a room? They took us...No. It was...it was like a cave.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was their underground hiding place. And the Germans knew that there was such places, but they couldn't lay hands on it, p ~ and therefore, they decided to put the ghetto on fire...to set the ghetto on fire to get rid of everybody which they did unfortunately. And that's how we got from the...from the ghetto with these people took us with their...through their caves to the Warsaw side which was called the Irish side....to the Irish side. That's the story how we got out from the, the two girls, myself and Alla, from the ghetto. Through these people.</p><p>These were really martyrs and what happened to them later I have no idea. But that's how we got to the Irish side, and that's where the saga started with me. Somehow Alla and I got separated. She said she was married to a Polish guy, and she said she knows of somebody</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And I was alone in Warsaw. Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And she's married.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's how I got out of the ghetto.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Now the ghetto has not yet been destroyed?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Okay. I didn't know where to go. But I remembered, you know certain things stay in your mind, that we had a person that worked for my father I think his name was Nodrudtki. I remembered that he lived in Jeravia Street in Warsaw, and I thought maybe I should try to go there. And I went there and 3 0 a p I found him and he took me in. He said, "I can't keep you long, but I will keep you awhile." That's how...this was my hiding place in Warsaw. Jeravia 24 or 22 Jeravia...20.

The funny part was also I met a lady who works...a Polish lady who works for the Polish Embassy in Washington, and I met her through a friend who works for the United States. Annie Core. And she had met her...she works now as a representative for the Polish people that work in the Embassy.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: While you were there, since this was when Warsaw was being...the ghetto was being destroyed, did you see that destruction?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I could see the flames. Yes. From the Irish side, all you saw is flames, smoke. That's all you saw because it's very close. The streets from Jeravia, Unleshno (ph) and Zamenhova its now too, too far. So I could see what happened. When I went there, but then I was hiding and I couldn't get out anymore. I was always hiding in that...in that...on that attic.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can we...before we moved into the hiding, I would like to take you back into Warsaw before you leave. You are...when you were in Warsaw, you were describing the terrible conditions and the difficulty.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell me about that. What did you know?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: All I knew that there is a resistance and they are fighting in the woods. There is a song which I don't have. It was in Jewish, that song, about the fighters the resistance fighters. I am sure somebody must have it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The song is well known and that is fine.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So you knew about them. Did you know about any resistance being organized in the ghetto itself.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No. No. Had no idea. You know, we were so involved in each other in the daily routine which was no routine. It just happened. From hour to hour we knew that an end was coming, we just didn't know when. O: What was the Jewish community leadership doing at that time?</p></p></dialogue>

Not at all. But I knew about the resistance group, and I knew that they are around Warsaw...in and around Warsaw, but I had no idea of any other things. But the conditions were terrible since we didn't have enough food, especially enough water, typhus came around, and when the Germans took us out, you know, everybody was emaciated already, and that's why my parents got killed in front of me. They looked so bad that they thought, "Well, they're no good for us anymore." And lots of other people...and they just boom, boom, boom, and everybody went. And, as I said my two sisters were taken to concentration camp. They were put on a...on a wagon on the trucks and Alla and I...1 was not with my sisters. I couldn't even be with them because I was older and they thought that I looked good enough to work, and they were the younger and with children and the children were taken away and evidently to camp right away. So that's how it was. When I was in Warsaw, this was all in 1941, beginning of 1941...March. And when I was hiding out, a few weeks was fine. I thought, "Well, we will see what happens." But one day they came into me to the attic...not only that...at the attic, I contracted whooping cough. You know what whopping cough is, and they got scared to death because with having the whooping cough, you cannot sit still. When somebody comes around, and hear I hark, hark, hark, they were afraid, and they thought they cannot keep me any longer. Okay? I have to find a way what to do. At that time, I was let go. At that time I had 20 dollar gold piece...a 20 dollar gold piece cause all the other jewelry and things, I already...I didn't have it anymore.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Why? What did you do with it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Okay. What I did is when I tried to get the false papers I had to pay with something. Okay.</p><p>And when I let...when they let me go, I had a 20 dollar gold piece, and I just didn't 37 know where to go. So when they let me go on the street, some 2 Germans...SS men I imagine...approached me, and they said, "Who are you? What are you doing here?" Well, they finally find out that I am Jewish, you know, by interrogating me, and I knew well, lam caught anyway and I don't care what happens to me. But I had the 20 dollar gold piece and I told to the guys I said...I said to them, "Well, if you let me go, I have something that I could give you." And they said, "What." I said, I have a 20 dollar gold piece." Well, they took the gold piece and let me go. But L...I still had no place to go.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you still have false papers on you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And still false papers on me, yes. Where do I go from there? That was the question. And it was almost curfew hour. The curfew was 9:00. Well, I wondered. I just wondered and I thought it doesn't matter to me if 1 get caught. If I get caught, I get caught; if I don't, I don't.</p><p>Life was cheap. And I wandered, I wandered until the Wisla, River Wisla [NB: the Vistula], and I sat there and I was contemplating ... should I...should I jump into the river and finish up with myself. I didn't know how to swim. But I thought suicide would be the best thing. I wouldn't fall into German hands. I would do it myself. And along came from nowhere this man, Jan Majetki, and he said, "You know, it's almost curfew hour. What are you doing here?" And he started to interrogate me. Who are you? Where are you coming from? Well, he realized that I am Jewish and I couldn't hide anymore and I told him who I am. I showed</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

He said, "Well, I am the Director of the Polish Camp." It was like a camp for the Poles that escaped from the German rules. I can take you in there for a little while. I said, "Fine." So he took me in there, and I think the street was Ulitza Sfientoieskaia (ph) . And he said I can give you a little room and you can stay there, but not for long because we are being, uh, the Germans know 5~ that we keep Jews there and they are after us every so often. So I said, "Well, whatever happens happens. If you can take me now, fine. I'll go with you." And I went with him. That's how I got to this Polish house.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can you describe the house?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: This must have been...well, it was March. It must have been around the beginning of April or something like that because in June, I was...to Germany. Well, I stayed there until such time but every so often Germans came there and really tried to find whether they are Jews. But at one time it was so hot that he said, "Maria, I cannot keep you any longer. We have to part."</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was the house like? That is, where there many people there? Who was hiding there"?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Only Poles. Most of the Poles and a few Jews which I didn't meet, but mostly Poles and it was a house, just a plain house, uh, they had some rooms. It was also very crowded. But I got special treatment from him for some reason or other. I don't know why. But I realized later why because he corresponded with me. He really liked me. Anyway, I got that room, No. 6, and I stayed there until it was so hot that he couldn't keep me anymore. He really had to...to get rid of all the Jews. I was the last one and he parted with me, and we kissed and he gave me that medal when he parted with me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Will you show us the medal please and then tell us what it is. You have it on.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. I didn't know that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Let's take it out and show it to the camera. We'll show it again later. And that is the medal.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>That is the holiest medal in Poland. Maka Holska Czestohovska. They were a few holy ladies, but the lady from Jan Batski, was the holiest of all. And this is the medal that he gave me when we parted and this is only, you know, the...the chain is not there anymore, but he kept it for me. He got this one from his brother who was a priest who also perished in the same camp where my sisters perished. This Jan Majeski for awhile was working in the underground, in the Polish underground for Poles, but then after the war he organized that camp for Poles that escaped from. ..Okay? And this is the medal that I kept. And he told me to promise him that I will keep that medal with me all the time and this will keep me alive.</p><p>And needless to say, I really honestly kept that medal with me all the time until I gave it away to the Holocaust Museum. I kept it always with me. Not that I believed in it, but I promised him that I will keep it with me, and I did. Every night in Germany I looked at that medal and I thought how...how safe I am because I don't know with that medal or whatever, but I am safe, alive. Better safe I don't know, but alive. Anyway that was the time...when we</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Well, needless to say, there was a raid and we were all taken to Germany and we were taken in cattle trains...by cattle trains to German, to Berlin.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Describe the trip. Would you please?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The trip was terrible. We were all crowded and, of course, I would never say that I am Jewish. Alright? We were all Poles. I am sure there were a lot of Jews...which I was afraid to talk to anybody. I kept to myself. But then on the way to Berlin, they asked, "Who speaks German?" And I y) /) volunteered, and I said I speak German, I speak Hoch Deutch , not Plat Deutch (ph). Hoch Deutch is the cultivated German. Plat Deutch, I didn't know. As such, I was chosen as the fuhrer, what is it? Not the manager, but the manager of the group to go to Germany, because I spoke German and the SS men, they spoke German. So they communicated with me. When they brought us all to German...to Berlin, I was told because I was the fuhrer, the manager, the leader. Fuhrer is the leader. I will have a choice of where I wanted to go to work tin Germany which I thought was a good idea. Okay? We came to Berlin. I don't even remember how it looked, but it was a mass of people, not only our group but lots of people, lots of people and lots of mostly Poles. And they said to me, "You have a choice to go either on a farm to an ammunition fabric or to hotels. I thought for myself to be safer it would be the best thing to go on a farm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Why?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because I knew it'll be a lot hard work that I won't meet so many Poles. I was afraid to meet Poles. That was the idea.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you still had the false papers?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I still had my false papers as a Christian girl. Sure. As Maria Xowalcik. The middle name was Jadwiga. As such, I came to Germany as Maria Kowalcik. And I thought for my own sake, I probably would be safer to be away from everybody. And I thought on a farm, Poles would probably not likely go to a farm. They might want to go a hotel, to some offices, to any other place, but I thought for myself, I would rather go to a farm. First of all, I was emaciated. I was about 80, 90 pounds skin and bones when I came to Germany. Skin and bone. And as such I came to Germany. They told me where they are going to bring me, to Krushart, near Oslingen. It is a small farm that the man that owns the farm is paralyzed but he has a son-in-law by the name of Karl Beck and a daughter. She was just married to this Mr. Beck. And I was brought to Krunhart. That's how I came to Germany. Okay? I was a city girl. I never knew what work means because at home we were wealthy. We had maids, and we had everything. I never even knew how to boil a glass of water. Very spoiled...very...really very well taken care of, and I had no idea what a farm means...work on a farm. Anyway, but I adapted and I adjusted very well. I knew that that's the way it is. That's</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

I better make the y ?- 4S best of that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Describe the farm. Would you please?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Okay. Was a very small farm. They had an Uncle Karl. I forget his last name. And Louise and Mr. Beck, and Mr. Sharf and myself. A very small farm. We had about 6 cows. We had chickens and pigs and all sorts of animals around the farm. Of course, I had to take care of everything. I had no idea how to milk cows, but when I came there, the nice thing was when I came to the farm, it was...it was June 16th or June 21. I don't remember exactly. I think it was June 21. It was a nasty day; a rainy, nasty cold day and I had nothing with me, just what [had on, old clothes and my emaciated. Just skin and bones. But I had my presence always.</p><p>On a farm, there is lots to eat. I better be careful eating, not to eat everything right away. I had the presence of mind to be careful of eating not to get sick. So the first thing I came there, it was cold and the woman, Mrs. Louisa Beck, she looked like a very terribly harsh woman, talk, big, but a real German woman, you know. And I thought oh, oh, this is not the place I should have gone. But she was very kind to me, very kind to me. Really motherly almost. She showed me to a room where it would be and it was very nice room, a very small room with just a bed and a bureau and me. But it was very nice. The nicest part of it was when I went to bed...you know we had feather beds in Germany...when I went to bed, the bed was warm. And I was wondering what happened. She had a warm bottle to warm up the bed, and I thought then she can't be that bad. If she did that, she must have heart. Of course, I was Polish. She didn't know that I was Jewish. So then I thought maybe life won't be so bad.</p><p>Anyway, that was the experience and she gave me milk and ham and bread, but I didn't eat any. I just had some milk and some bread and butter. I was afraid to eat really, because I was hungry, emaciated and I thought...I had the presence of mind not to eat everything right away but just go slowly about it until I get used to food again. So then it really started. The next morning she tried to introduce me to everybody. She had a brother by the name Ernst who fought in the army and he was in Russia then. He had a little boy by the name of Fritz. He was then a baby about 2 or 3 months old, and she told me I had to take care of the baby which I was glad. And some other chores she told me that I had to do in the beginning which was fine. It wasn't too much, but then they got me into the real nitty gritty, the real farm work. She showed me how to milk cows. That was the worst part. Well, to milk the cows I remember for about a month my fingers were like this. I could not straighten them out. You had to use force to use what do you call the (ph), and my fingers were like this for about 2 to 3 months. I just couldn't straighten them out. But then slowly I knew how to do it, and it was...was fun. And I used to drink the milk directly from the cows. I milked them. I drank the milk. Anyway, I got very fat as you saw. After awhile, I was there about 2 months, I got very fat. I had at that time long hair and I braided them and put them up here as you see will see on the pictures. And, uh, then she taught me really what I had to do and it was hard work taking care of all the animals and get up in the morning about 5:30, go at night about 12:00 to bed and feed all the animals, take care of the chickens, of the ...of the pigs, whatever we had on the farm. And also I had to learn how to mow grass and the...what <t call="" cereal="" do="" english...the="" from,="" grain,="" in="" it.<="" know="" make="" p="" this="" uh...uh...the..-uh...you="" what="" where="" you=""></t></p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And we had to mow grass for the cows for the winter to store hay for the winter and all that. All that had to be done. We had chickens. I had to gather the eggs and all that. It was a lot of work and I did most of the work because Louise, Mr. Beck was working in the ammunition factory during the day. He came only home at night. Mr. ...the owner was paralyzed.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't know. It was a very small farm...really very small farm. Pour of us could take care of it, but we all had to work hard. As I said her husband was home only in the evening. He left in the morning and came hone about 8:00 at night from the factory...from the ammunition factory there he worked for the SS. And in the evening there wasn't much to do, but Sundays he helped us out. Sundays we worked very...I worked most of the day cause they went to church. First of all, I had to...I was Catholic... had to change my religion. They were Seven Day Adventists and they sort of hinted to se to change the religious. I did change. I thought what the heck, it doesn't matter to me. So I was Protestant, you know, I went with them to church every Sunday and prayed with him or whatever it was, and there were meetings in the house, also, once a week which Mr. ...that owner who was paralyzed. He presided.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You didn't?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I didn't because I never went to church. I came to Germany and they said, well, you will be awhile with us. Why don't you change to our religion? And I know so little about Catholicism and the girls that were there...there were other Poles in the village. They were all Christians...really Poles.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you have to go through conversion?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. Nothing. Because Mr.... the President of that union...of that Seven Day Adventists, whatever it was. And everything was in his house. As a matter of fact, sometimes the ceremonies were in his house because he could not go to church and his daughter played the...not the piano...what is the other thingv?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The organ?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The organ. As a matter of fact, she started teaching the organ. And she played the organ and when the meetings were there, we went into that room and we had the meetings there. So I was very comfortable there instead of going to the Catholic Church, which I know nothing about. I thought it's a good idea that I did. And I was very glad that I did change. And they hinted to me...not that they almost like forced me to it...but I thought it was a good idea and I did it, and I was very glad that I did it because this way I did have to go with the Poles.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you also didn't have to pretend. You knew a great deal about the Seventh Day Adventists.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Exactly. Yes. And the whole week I worked very hard. We had no live to get together. Only Sundays. And Sundays I went to church so I had very little connections with the Polish girls that were there. There were two girls...Polish girls...of which I have pictures. But we were very good friends and every body worked very hard. You really didn't have much time. One of the girls was very badly treated on her far. She couldn't eat or sleep in the house. She had to sleep elsewhere near the stables, you know. But I was very lucky. I really had nice people.</p><p>But, of course, knowing that I aw Christian, you now...but they were kind to me, really kind.</p><p>I had no complaints about that.

And before the war, I had gall stone troubles, but then during the war somehow because of the meager diet and all that, I had no problems.

And J ate all that and I like it and it was good. I got fat on it. And I felt fine, but all of a sudden I took ill. And evidently that...the gall stones occurred again because of all the fat, and the butter and the Bilk, I couldn't digest that very well and I got sick.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You had to wear your P.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: All the time. All the time. But neither one of us wore it all the time. Because it was a small village, but there was one police guy that lived in the village that had very bod...he didn't care very much for Dr. Hard and he sort of took it out on me. One time when I went out to wait for the bus to get to the doctor and he caught me without the P and needless to say, he really took advantage of me. He really beat me up well. I went back home. I didn't go to the doctor. I went back hone and I cried myself sick and I was very upset about it and talked to his. He said, "Why did you do that to her? She's such a good worker...and all that." Well, he said, "She has to wear a P anyway. I went to the doctor without the P at the time, and I went back to crying and I put the P back and I went to the doctor. And he...when he beat me up..-he also put in a...he sued me. He took me to the court that I as a Christian girl and I didn't wear the P. He took me to the court. And you know, there is in minority, if 1 have the original from the court...and I told the Judge the truth that I forgot the P but I got an attack of gall bladder and I had to rush to the doctor and in my rushing I forgot the P and went without it. And, I forgot his name...the policeman's name, I don't remember anymore...and he beat me up.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Let's stay... You are telling the court?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The court. What had happened. And the court believed me but the guy, the policeman was there...he said it was not true what I as saying and that I also said that he said...the policeman said when I got to court I'll probably have to pay some money as I punishment and he...the policeman said to me...said to the court that I said money doesn't mean anything to me...German money doesn't mean anything to me. It was a lie...and I said that to the court...the Judge. The Judge really believed me what I said, and he dismissed the policeman and, uh, however, they punished me with. ..But I told the Judge that I don't have any money.</p><p>I was supposed to get paid 20...a month, but I never got paid. And I told the Judge I don't have any money, and he can do whatever he wants to with me. If he wants to put me to jail, let him put me to jail. But the Judge was very, very nice to me. He just gave me the punishment and he said whichever way I can pay I'll pay. And I brought the judgment back to Mr. Sharo and Mr. Sharp intervened and they made it to 15...so Mr. Sharv paid 15... I didn't pay anything. And the receipt is there. I have the original receipt. But the Judge was so nice to me. He was so sympathetic to me. What he did, he asked me to be the translator for the Poles when they come to Court. They don't know how to speak German. Would I be translating for them? At the end it was a good thing for me. I helped the judge with the Poles.</p><p>I translated from Polish into German. So, the judge was very, very nice with me. He believed what I said and he accepted my testimony rather than the policeman's.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you stay working on the farm also while you did translations for the judge?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. Yes. I told them that whenever the judge wants me I would have to go and they were very pleased that I did that.

So that was...the end was pretty good in spite of everything, but I had a lot of scare cause I thought, God knows what will happen now. If they put me to jail, they'll really find out who I was. You know, they'll start interrogating me and all that, and I was scared to death, but it ended well, really for me. It ended very well. So that's how it was in the court. But I had a few frightening days and sleepless nights and all that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What happened after the business court?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: After I had been to court? Well, I came back to the farm and everything was fine. And that policeman never bothered me again. Never bothered me again! And Mr. Sharb was very upset about it, you know, because he knows the guy and he says he shouldn't have done it to him...not only to me, but to him...that I was working for him and I was very good and never any problems with me. Why did he do that? Ho was just nasty...a very nasty man. He was very nasty to the other Polish girls. He really was.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: OK. Did anything else happen before liberation?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I was just working and, uh, nothing special happened. I just feverishly read the newspapers; you know to see what was going on. Because they really did not know...this farmer did not know... think people from the village knew what was really going on with the Jews. They really honestly did not know. Everything was kept in such a way that most of the people were not aware of it. And these people particularly had no idea what was going on.</p><p>Really! So I stayed there...after the liberation, I stayed there about 2 more weeks longer.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Wait. Don't jump quite so fast. What happened at liberation? How did you know there was liberation?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: At liberation, the American soldiers came into the village and they asked me who are you and why are you here.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. And he was scared. He was hiding the uniform when they came in and I didn't think of the uniform at this time. They were looking mainly for arms. When they left, he came out to me and he said, "Maria, I have the uniform and I want you to burn it. I don't want anything left here that I was an SS man. OK?" He gave me the uniform and we had in the living room a pot belly stove. He gave me the uniform and he said, cut it up and burn it. I don't want to have it in the house. And so I did. And let me tell you that very tongue of false that came up was like a...to me. For all the things that I went through...that I saw my parents die, my sisters taken to the concentration camp and with all the misery that I lived through and all that, I thought, why me. Dear God, this is something that I can be thankful for...that I can do it. And that's how the sculpture came about. When I started school, my teacher, Rebecca, came and said to me...</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And I burned that uniform and he was very happy about it. However, I found out the Americans told me in Stuttgart, there is a Jewish DP camp and they are forming now a community, a Jewish community, and where I can go and all that. I still, however, was afraid to leave the farm and I didn't tell the farmers who I was at all. I still stayed on 2 weeks. You know when you are under those circumstances; I was afraid what will happen if there is a retreat. If the Americans retreat, God forbid, and they find out who I was, you know. So I stayed on for 2 weeks. I didn't tell them a thing. And after 2 weeks...in the meantime, I went to Stuttgart and I found out that there is indeed a Jewish community and there is form a DP camp...displaced person camp, and that I have a place to go now. I know where to go. And so I came back and I told them that I am ready to leave and who [ as. Well, I still can see the face of these people. Was Mr. Beck, Mr. Beck and Mr. Sharp. They looked at me and said, Maria, it can't be. No Jewish girl would work like that." You know, they...they really didn't know. They never even saw a Jew before. They thought maybe Jews really have horns or whatever. They said, "Cannot be! I said, Yes, Mr. Beck, I am Jewish and I showed them the false papers then and I told then I am going to the DP camp. I ax going to live there, and well they were very surprised. They said, you can live here. You can be with us. And...uh, they</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

The first thing they said, it can't be true. A Jew would not work like this on a farm. I really worked hard and I worked...I worked well. I worked for me because I knew that this is it. I have to do what I have to do. You know!</p><p>Anyway when we parted he gave me that knife. Mr. Beck...they all kissed ne and hugged me then. Even though...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Hold the knife up.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And he gave me that knife. And that knife I took. This knife here. And this is an old knife.</p><p>He belonged to the SS, you know, and he took it from his mess and gave it to me as a remembrance. And I was really very grateful for him...for that, that he did that. I think this was a nice gesture after all. 1 mean if he had known if I was Jewish it wouldn't be that. But I showed his the papers and I showed his everything, and I told him everything, and they just could not believe it. They could not believe a minute of it, but that's how we parted. At parting, he gave me that knife.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Before you go on with your story, I would like to go back a minute and ask you...Mr. Beck was in the SS during all the years you were at the farm. What did he do as part of the SS?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I have no idea. I know he worked in the... You know, everything was very secretive.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. And those nights when he came back like that I got terribly scared because I was afraid.</p><p>You know every so often, he made advances and when he was home not quite sober, I got scared and I didn't go to bed then. I went to the bed until I knew he went to bed and he was asleep. And I did some work, whatever it was to do in the kitchen or whatever. Mrs. Beck used to say to me, "Maria, why don't you go to bed?" I said, oh, I have to do this, that and the other thing, and I made sure that he is asleep, and that is when I went to bed. I really was afraid; you know that he might assault me in some way. Because he...you know, he felt sometime like that, especially when he came back. You know, there was a young Polish girl who was older than he was and she was a hefty woman, talk and hefty as you will see on the picture, and he said this is a nice morsel, you know. And I really got seared, and rightly now.</p><p> So these days were terrible days...nights for me really. I couldn't sleep well and I was always on the alert. But on the whole, they were nice to me as a Christian. They treated me well, and, uh, I was a hard worker.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But you really didn't know much about his work in the SS?</p></p></dialogue>

I said, "Well, I'll think about it." And I did. I did do a sculpture...a sculpture of the burning Nazi. I told you that he asked me...this Nazi asked me to burn his uniform. I thought this would be a good subject to do, and I did that burning Nazi...a sculpture of that. And that's how the sculpture came about. But really Rebecca was instrumental because I didn't want to talk about it. I wouldn't do anything about it, and she is the one that really, really made me do it. And I as very grateful for her, because since then I talk about it...because on May 4, I gave sort of a little interview for the Holocaust Museum with Susan. And I told about the experiences and my daughter was present at that time and then she said, mommy, why didn't you ever tell me about it?" I never did talk about it until I did this sculpture.
