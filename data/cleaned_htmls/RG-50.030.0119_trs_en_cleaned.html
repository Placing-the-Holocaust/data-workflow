How's that? And there was a doctor Primar Horn (ph) from Nihlava (ph), and I told him all these messages which we had from this radio, yes, and he was interested I should tell him always, we knew when the prisoners came, the new prisoners, so the SS men told you will take these prisoners to, to a cell and we brought them their food but it was always in the, we were guarded when we did by an SS man.

That you couldn't go, only you could keep the cart on this 30 centimeter wide plank road. So he collapsed. And when he collapsed, so the whole road collapsed, couldn't go. So the kappos came and they beat this man who collapsed. You will go or not go, and so maybe he make some two or three rounds and he collapse and there were every day twenty, thirty dead which we brought in the camp exhausted, yes, from this. So our group of five we survived in this way - that the possibility of us if you could read the shower to give the road to the carts, to run the carts it was very exhausting, it was very hard that somebody could keep it without uh rest. So we always could uh changed. The kappos allowed that if somebody of our five, un voluntarily he told I will give up my place in the shovel (ph) to this man with the cart. And so we could give it up. Do you understand?</p></p></dialogue>

And they are burning them [with] this. And this sonderkommando which you see, they are on the night shift." And he asked me if I can make a lock or something to repair for him. And so he told, but I would not believe it. I couldn't. And he told me (whispered), "You don't believe it." I couldn't believe. Look, I was three years in the camp at the time. "And look, so you will see it." And I didn't know. A few days, came an SS man for me to this kapo. He needs a schlosser [Ger: "locksmith, mechanic or fitter"], a blacksmith, to repair a bearing in this wagon. You know a bearing. And he took me and brought me there, and he stand nearby me when I make this metal (ph), this bearing house from this wagon which was broke. And I saw it. I saw how the Slovak sonderkommando, Slovak prisoners, uh buried...uh took...digged out these open graves. And as they came, the corpses put on these wagons, and brought them back where they were. And from far, I saw also this white bunk house, bunkers--this farm house, where this...I saw it. So from this, moment I believe it. So how hard was it belief to other people, yes. Now, and so...and this, there was the first sonderkommando from Slovakia which came in April 1942, and they were took from these one thousand men, three hundred; and they brought...they used them for this sonderkommando. Yes, and there was the first sonderkommando. And short after, I think in December, they organized a mass escape. And somebody traited...was a traitor and who thought he will save his own life, and he told it to the SS men. And the whole sonderkommando was uh ...one day the whole sonderkommando, and they took them to Auschwitz I and they shot them and burned them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell me about the mass escape which was planned.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, the mass escape of this sonderkommando was planned at that time was possible to escape, the fences were not so tight, Birkenau, it was in the middle of the woods and so on, and there were some escapes, yes, but you must see that people refused to work. But in the moment when they refused to work, or didn't work good, the they shot, the SS men shot them, on the spot, yes. And uh this, and their blockaltester (ph) this Rosin (ph)</p><p> , and still he is living. You should hear him. Yes, I will give you <span class="page-break" number="14"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 0 that it was uh, told to SS men, yes, and the one who told it, yes, they killed him with an axe.</p><p>This traitor, they killed him. They killed him, but it was too late.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The Jews killed him?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, the Jews killed him. The name isn't known at all, in the details. And so, and exactly four days or five days later came a new transport from Polish ghettos, and from this transport they took a new sonderkommando, about three hundred men, and from this survived several and I have very detailed uh testimonies of them, and so, and also from this Rosen (ph). From this Rosen (ph) I have this hugh, he escaped later from Auschwitz. Uh we know how he saved Europe, how he saved. Look, it was forbidden to get from this sonderkommando commando, to the other , to transport to another, nobody could go away from this other commando. But this Rosen (ph), he found a, bread, you know, a whole bread, and when he break this bread, inside in this bread was a golden chain and a gold watch, yes. Inside, from the deportees. Someone told it will save his life, so brought him this. And so he was on the block and he gave this a to the blockaltester, . (Say it again in <span class="page-break" number="15"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 1 between Birkenau and Auschwitz I. And when he was a roofer, yes, on the roof, you know, the tar, and on the roof is the tar, they were putting roofs and the covered with the tar, youknow, with the paper, you know with this. And for tar, it must be the store for tar was in Auschwitz I, in the main camp, and so from time to time he came to Auschwitz I. We came also from time for some material we needed, so we came to Auschwitz I, only as uh with a guarded with an SS man, but we had connections. And this uh Shmuleski (ph), make the connections with this main camp, and they, and so I gave this and he told, you should all observe and tell me and we will, the Polish uh prisoners have contact with the Polish government in London. They have contact through Armia Kraiova. We have note from Birkenau, but we, he told us, not names, but he, and this he, he knew much, but we knew the details, more details. So I told him the details and he gave it further to this uh, to this uh camp group at Auschwitz, this fighting group at Auschwitz. And they have the contact. But later we knew that they are guarding only their own interests. For Jews, they didn't care. So we then, later we find some Czech-Polish, some Czech civil workers, you know, who worked, but they were Czechs, yes, and the detail how it worked we have three. And they came from time to time, in three months they could go travel to their families to Czechlovakia. And even if they were guarded, they were civil workers, as I told you, at the civil enterprise which were, so one was a carpenter, one make roofs, and one was expert for the canalization, yes for the canalization, the the channels (ph), and for water pipes and so. We make with them connections and so were were connected, and we also, we could stole plans, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did you steal plans?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Somebody would not believe it. How it was possible. It's already, I can show you a letter from Polish museum I got now, a certification for it .. There was a so-called Baulaitung of Auschwitz, a construction office, a hugh construction office of SS, who made the planning and construction of their hugh camps and of the cremetoria, the gas chambers, yes, there was a hugh office, there were several hundred. But they also took some prisoners, some uh, qualified prisoners. So there was, for instance, an engineer, Vera Foltinf (ph). He was an architect, an engineer. So they took him to draw the plans, see, in the office. There was Bitterman, he was an engineer, so they took him and he was in the commando. He took there and in the office he drawed (ph) for the SS men. And so we pursuaded him he should make a small copies of the plans. And he smuggled it out, and we gave it later to these civil workers, and it came to Prague, and the wife of Kraus, my friend who was non-Jewish, and he was, he had contact through the Swiss consulate in Prague. And so the plans went to the Swiss consulate, through this. An original of these plans are in The Death Factory, exactly the plans, yes. They were later when it was this, maybe you know this, when it was revived the Holocaust when the CIA make these pictures, you know, the Americans photographed Auschwitz, (right), you know this, exactly, but they told they didn't knew. They never bombed. Yes. And later, after many years, they make, they published it publically, the, all these pictures. There were seven raids on Auschwitz, and there is also written that</p><p> is make according to that factory, they ask that the plans are so exactly, <span class="page-break" number="16"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 2 when you see it from, so you see the prints, the basement prints, exactly what we stole from this, from this factory. So it was, and so we had luck. We were lucky that uh, there were many people who paid with life this activity yes. But, and so, that I told you, I was conscious that I can not, it was not according to the human calculation that you would survive. Yes.</p><p>Especially they guarded us. Yes. So I remember once I was going, it was in "44, in autumn, I was going through the uh, the gate. And always there was a guard. And I always must tell halfling numeral this and this number are going there and there. And he mark the number where I am in the camp. Yes. That is in evidence. I was going, always without guard, in this guarded area. I could go without guard when I had this permission; and I told him the number--73,000. And there was already 400,000 tattooed. "So what, 73,000, (ph)?</p><p>Repeat!" I repeat. He jumped and go and look on my... "And how's that you are not dead?</p><p>You should be dead. This is not possible!" So I told him, "Look, I have this...1 am expert in this." "Oh, you should not be...you will not alive. You will not wait, Ivan. We have five, you will not wait alive Ivan. You cannot expect that, Ivan. We will save you, yes, the Russians, yes," he told. . Five minutes before and we , we will shot you <span class="page-break" number="17"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 3 so, it was between these two camps and I had to wait and in the other camp, this was a women's camp, and I had to repair some kitchens there, or some kettles, so I had to wait by the guard. They had the guardstube [Ger: "guardroom"], the guard house, yes; an SS man always guarded it. But when the transport came, I had to wait. The SS man was very curious, and he also tried to organize something, yes, when there was some food or something valuable. So they always tried. So I have to wait "til he had time to register my name. And so I observed. And this time, I... I experienced a very interesting and moving, moving sense.</p><p>Yes. So the whole, I net (ph) this hundred selections, I saw many. And everybody tell you, "Mengele, Mengele." It's not true. Look, the Mengele, they didn't very often the selection.</p><p>There were twenty-three doctors--twenty-three doctors--who had the service for selections at the ramp. And sometimes also was Mengele; but Mengele was eager to have the twins, and the people who were not normal. You know, they had the of something distracted people--he was interested in this. So he didn't...he didn't trust also to the selectees...to his colleagues who selected, and he always watched. And so did his , "Are you <span class="page-break" number="18"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 4</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Look. The Kanada, it was a special squad--a special detail, so-called averamudienst (ph) in German. Averamudienst (ph). It means that they should clean, they should help when the prisoners, deportees, came. So they had the service; and they always told to the prisoners, in their language, "Out of the wagons, and you should go left. All your luggage, they will bring it in the camp. You should not care." And so they have the task to quiet them a little, yes; and there was also a I can't. And after their...they have to quiet them in their own language. And the SS men were also behind them . And after their transport were selected and put...put to...brought to the gas chambers, out of the camps who were working, who were able-bodied. So then it was a heap of trunks of all this, and they brought with a list to the Kanada camp, where there was thirty barracks where all the belongings of these deportees were sorted. Were sorted and checked. Many people uh, uh sewed in their raiments, in their shoes, in every possible hidings, , and all. And this were, and the guard sorted, and when they found something so they must give it away. Ifa prisoner tried to organize, to take something for himself, so if he was catched, he was shot on the spot. But nevertheless, this brunt (ph), this business with the SS man also tried to get something but had access, and so used the prisoners who had access and so on, yes. It was very complicated.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: O.K. Are we rolling? O.K. Let's take it back to that moment where you saw Brazovsky (ph) on the floor and they came back to you and you knew you were in trouble.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So and Kraus (ph) came to us, what we should do. We, there was a fiend of us who was in charge of the station for repairing the teeth for SS men, yes. They came there. He was expert for this, he was an artist and a doctor for, dentist doctor.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: This is Kraus, going back?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Can't think what he was told the SS asked him. He was then back, he couldn't, he came in twenty minutes, half-hour back, laughing. Back. Just laughing. And he told the story. I came to this office and there were two SS men, Lachman (ph) and Boger (ph), I knew them. There was a table and on the table was the camera and they whip. A whip, yes, and it was a pistol. And they asked me did you know the camera. Yes, I know. How did you get to this camera? So I told them the story, I found it a carriage and I brought this baby carriage and we found the camera and so. So why didn't you give up the camera to the SS men? Look, the camera, it's like a machine gun, a machine gun, yes, would you shot me. So we need some cigarettes, so we tried. So, and for what reason you would have this carriage.</p><p>Ah, this carriage, look, some SS would have repaired some baby carriage, so I told him I will make him a good service, when I can repair, so he told it the guard. So let us know the name of the SS man who ordered, who have from you the repair of a baby carriage. The guard's name I don't remember. So you don't remember, so they give me a slap, they give me another slap. Now, you remember. I cannot. So they opened the door. Look, you will look like this, like Brazovsky, if you don't admit to whom you made the repair.

There were another when we have a radio, and so.</p><p>But this, I never will forget, this one when Kraus came back laughing after this and told this story. Yes. But later, they make the photographs, later. There are known, these photographs, these three or four photographs, and I discovered in the bathroom they were made and the stories about them, it's not true that Shmuleski made them. It's told Shmuleski told he made them but it's not true. I later discovered who, why.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Who made them?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It made, a Polish, a Greek officer, a young Greek officer. Who later tried to escape and were killed. Uh, I puzzled the place where from it was done. Shmulevski told it was done from the roof, yes, and he told him but he wouldn't . And so, but when I was in Yad Vashem working, and so I showed these photographs to a photographer who was there and he asked me how it was done. I told him from the roof. It is not possible, the angle is not possible from the roof, it is not possible. And yes, he was true. And later I know how it was from the frame, we found the frame of the gas chamber in the cremetorium number four, there from it was done. Yes, so this is the story.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Interesting. Let's go back to you, go back to Erich Kulka. What happened after that camera incident?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: After the camera incident, nothing. Nothing.

In this camp, there were about thirty barracks, like prisoner barracks. And in these barracks were sorted all the belongs which the...the...which were taken off from the deportees. Yes. And in these barracks, when they came, they was sonderkommando. The prisoners, they must go and take off all their uh . And in another barrack, they got another uh suits, clothes. So...and when they returned they must...they must make also in one barrack, and then another. So they could not keep, or very hard to keep, something in their raiments. The same was with the SS men, the SS men who observed; they came to the Gestapo, they came to make SS , shower, and in an elegant way. And also must keep their...their suits. They get other suits; and through the Gestapo...through the bathroom, yes. So also they could keep. So who could keep.</p><p>Sometimes they managed. But the...the artisans, for instance, we were called to repair electrician, or to repair a pipe or repair something. I remember an SS man asked when we should organize for him a fur, yes. Organize it a fur. A real fur, yes. A nice fur for his wife.</p><p>So when we came to this, when we have some work in Kanada, we knew that we would come there. So there the floor was...there was no planks, nothing. It was mud, on the...such...packed. Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, O.K. Packed dirt.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. Packed dirt, yes. And so we contacted these from Kanada, the prisoners which were in a neighboring camp.

So...so we were going through this. And the SS men [said], "You have something." "No. We have nothing." So we tried and and they didn't find. And this SS man, when we came on the camp to this SS man who offered this: "So where have you...?". "Uh, be patient. We will bring it to you." So we came to our...our maintenance barrack squad, into shop, of the squad, and the . And for our eyes he was a good ring or something. He phoned to another SS man, before me, you fool, how did you check these people. They brought it. Yes, so if, he asked how it's our secret. So this is the way, but we were sure, if he would find this prisoners who make this organization, gold or something very valuable, he would give him slip and he would sew in pocket. He would not . But even if he would find a letter, even so innocent letter from a wife to a man at another camp, immediately he would take a notice to a Gestapo office, and they would brought you and murder you and kill you. Just, even make a case, a great case of a spy. And I don't know what.

Look, it means that they should prepare the killing of this whole camp from, the family camp. And we warned them, they would not believe it, they told it's not possible. Eichmann was there three months ago and they educated children, they had a school for children, they was interested in education. They could not believe it.
