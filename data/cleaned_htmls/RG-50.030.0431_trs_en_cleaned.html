My closest girlfriend came to visit me in Paris  <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> </p><p> after the Treaty of Munich in "38 and she became very ill in Paris. To such an extent that she was bedridden three months in my apartment and I was almost ready to take her back home. She had no parents, she had just an uncle who was a lawyer in Vilna. So she was all packed to go back to Poland and then she became very ill. So doctor operated on her and the operation wouldn't heal.</p><p>She was very, very sick. And I knew a lot about a professor in Switzerland who was a very famous specialist of tuberculosis and my husband wrote a letter to him and he told us to bring her. That was Christmas Eve, "39. And I, and I, she was packed already to go to Vilna to her uncle but I took her to Switzerland and she was, that was, she was also, her name also was Raya and we were the same age. We graduate from the same high school in Vilna. And we were, had a lot in common. She had no, no parents. Her mother was dead by that time and she lived with an uncle in Vilna who was a lawyer. Anyhow, I took her to Switzerland and she was bedridden for three years and she recovered and she went to, to Geneva I think she went. And she met a fellow, she married and she lived in Israel. And she, and she had a fairly decent life after that because . And I escaped from Paris June 2" I think, 1939. Just a few days before the Germans marched in. And we headed with these friends, these two friends by car for eight days to Toulouse. We slept in schools, we slept on the, in, on and it was not . And how did I, I my husband? And then my sister-in-law joined me. My sister-in-law who was a graduate, she was very bright and she was a graduate from the College de France de Paris . But then my husband, thank God, came, he was demobilized and we started, we lived first in the country. He was tending cows and doing other things on a farm.

And we managed, I even had a little help too because I didn't have enough milk to feed my child. I had some help from a next door neighbor who, I would pay her but she helped me with, because we had no running water, you know how it was during the war. Life was very hard but still we survived better than</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: What was it like for you as Jew in Toulouse at that time? Being a Jew with papers as a Jew?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well I must confess that we didn't feel it too much because my husband was a veteran of the French Army and he had a job for a French firm so we personally didn't feel any, persecution. The, the only time I started feeling it when I, we got American visa and we applied for the visa of exit.</p><p>And my husband visa of exit was turned down three times. They refused it. And then I think, pregnant with Daynya (ph), I went to Vishee (ph) France to plead my case because there was no reason for them to refuse my husband's visa of exit. He was a war veteran. He served ten months on the Marjinoline (ph) and it was just through anti-Semitism and persecution. So I was extremely lucky. It was like a miracle that I succeeded in getting the visa of exit.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did you do that? Who did you talk to?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: It was, it was, it was providence. It was real providence.

I didn't, I am a talker so, so I spoke to somebody in the restaurant and I told him what I came for and he directed me to whom to go to.</p><p>That was already a miracle, . And I came I, I saw the minister and I explained to him and I just had learned of my mother's death, just a few months ago. And the night before I went to see the, no the next day, I had a dream which I have never forgotten. My mother came to me and told me that and I woke up in cold sweat and it was that feeling, I went for the second time to see the, and he . And it was like, it was just a  <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> </p><p> miracle. I would like to read this postcard. Was written by Nomer (ph) and Son who is a very famous Jew is called . Lenin is in the museum, Lenin. And who was a prominent citizen of Paris, who was my husband's relative. And he was trying to get us to come to, to America but he said he can, he can bring us only to Santa Domingo. So it was really a miracle and there were another incident after I had all my papers and everything, a woman whom I asked to watch over my valise took her, took my valise instead of hers and boarded another train, in Vishee (ph). I was hysterical. I started screaming, somebody told, told, oh, she's on another train.</p><p>Anyhow, I went through her, my experiences, but I, I got the visa and we sailed for, through Spain and Portugal and we sailed to America and we came to America in 42. November, deg42. I was pregnant with ;</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Where did you live once you arrived?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: When, the first few weeks we lived at the cousin's house, the first maybe two or three weeks.</p><p>And then they helped us rent an apartment, a one bedroom apartment, upper, upper West Side. Do you know New York at all? We lived on the upper West Side, very close to . And my husband started working about ten days after. It was not easy, . And before</p><p> our family couldn't financially help us because one of my cousins who used to be very wealthy lost all his money and the cousin who paid for our trip to America . But my husband started working very soon and it was a struggle and, but I was lucky that I used, was able to get at least from my sister who was in Vilna under the Germans.</p><p> . And my, my later sister was very educated. She knew eight languages. That's through the, the eight language she learned already when she came to Cuba. But she knew German, French, Russian, Polish, Yiddish, Hebrew and. . .</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You had, how many sisters did you have?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: One.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: One sister. So this one sister stayed through the Vilna...</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Ghetto. She went to camps and then went to Cuba.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's right. And then came to America. From America she couldn't remain because she arrived in America with a girlfriend who helped her a great deal in camp. The other, the other friend. My sister was as I said, a linguist and the other one, a graduate of a very good trade school.</p><p>She was a very good seamstress. That's what kept her alive and helped her to help my sister.</p><p>That's how they survived. They were very devoted to each other. So when they came to America, they, my sister could have somebody marry her fictitiously so she could remain. But the other one couldn't get it and they went to Cuba and they suffered Cuba, for three years they suffered from the climate, atrocious. And finally, they came back.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Is there anything you would like to add?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well I, I really don't know what . This is a letter that I have from my sister in Polish where she says that she's more miserable there than she was in concentration camp. That's how miserable she was in Cuba because of the climate. Yes. She was highly educated.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Thank you very much.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And, and also this, here I have, in Paris, after I reached Lisbon, trying to tell her that I would try to do everything possible for them once I get to America. Unfortunately, they suffered a great deal under the Germans in France. So there was nothing really, I don't see.</p><p>Conclusion of interview.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
