<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I am the youngest son of a family of eight. And my father was a Baptist minister</p><p> and I grew up in, mostly in England. I-- I was born in Leicester and then we went to live in</p><p> Luton when my father moved to another church. Then we went to London, and I was sent</p><p> to a boarding school in Somerset. And --</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, quite young. About ten or something like that. I went to one of these schools which</p><p> is erroneously known as a public school, named as public school, but the public school in</p><p> those days was a private --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Excuse me --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: What's that? Private boarding school. And so it was considered a very good thing, if</p><p> you could afford it, to send your child to be at the boarding school, one of these boarding</p><p> schools.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, you were the youngest of eight?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were the older ones boys, girls?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, my eldest brother, my oldest two brothers were twins.And for reasons which I</p><p> will never know, my father called them Lincoln and Garfield. Then I had two sisters,</p><p> Myrtle and Iris. And then there were four boys, four more boys, Luke, David, Noel and me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And how much older than you were the twins?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, 14 years older than I was.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Um-hmm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And what was your father like?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He was a great man. He was a marvelous -- he was a Welshman and he was a</p><p> wonderful speaker and he just had a, I guess, a very satisfactory career as a minister of</p><p> different Baptist churches in England. And he was mildly active in politics, but not too</p><p> much so. And he devoted himself a lot to his chapel and his family.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And your mother?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My mother was also Welsh. Her name was Mary Elizabeth Peugh {ph}. And she was a</p><p> very good singer. In fact, she and my father met, I think, when -- at a temperance meeting,</p><p> you know, against drinking, where she was a soloist and he was a speaker. And that was in</p><p> Wales many, many years ago. And, well, she had a major job, obviously, was bringing up The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

She had four children under three, twins and two more right off just after they</p><p> were married. And then there was a gap and then four more, so she was busy. And she was</p><p> also very active in the life of the church.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So what was the atmosphere in your home like?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Very much family oriented. I want to divert, I think one of the great tragedies of today's</p><p> life is the fact that so many kids grow up without families. I can't imagine not having</p><p> grown up in a family, as part of a family. And, obviously, when I was -- by the time was</p><p> five or six my oldest brothers had already gone off to university. But we all came back for</p><p> Christmas, and I can still remember the family gatherings at Christmas and other special</p><p> occasions. My two sisters ran a private school and two of my brothers also became</p><p> ministers and the other brother was a businessman and then there was me. And, well, we</p><p> lived through some difficult times. A minister's salary, I don't know about nowadays, but</p><p> in those days was not very adequate. And we lived through First, when I was born in</p><p> 1914, right at the beginning of the First World War, and so my father had to bring up eight</p><p> children. And so we were all very busy. My sisters realized that being two ladies amongst</p><p> -- two girls amongst -- with six boys, that unless they put their foot down very early on</p><p> they would finish up by being kind of housekeepers. So we all had duties, somebody had</p><p> to do the washing out, somebody else had to clean all the shoes, somebody else had to</p><p> make the beds. And we were a fairly close-knit family.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And did you have chores also?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yes, yes. You have to wash up. They say that the male members of my generation</p><p> of our family were marvelous husbands because they all had this training from their sisters.</p><p>The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So even though you were the youngest, you had your chores to do?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, Bible. And --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So then you went away to school when you were ten. Did you want to go?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, I think so. It was a -- it was a very good experience, one I wouldn't have missed.</p><p> It was a very tough experience because when you are at a boarding school away from your</p><p> parents, a long way away from your parents, school discipline is quite tough, but as I say, I</p><p> wouldn't have missed it. And then I -- when I came back to -- to when I finished school, I</p><p> went into business and worked for a big international company, Kelly's Directory of</p><p> Merchants, Manufacturers and Shippers of the World. And then I worked for one of the</p><p> big building societies, I think they are called mortgage and loan societies here.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What kind of work did you do for these companies?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Accountant, bookkeeping.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Um-hmm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And then the war came.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Backing up a bit, how far did you go in school?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, I went through -- I graduated from this public school. In those days, going to one of</p><p> those schools was considered very adequate education. Some of the -- can I stop fora</p><p> minute?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Sure.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> {Pause.}</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You were saying that you went about as far in school as was usual for that time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: For the kind of career that I had in mind.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Um-hmm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But they went into the church or into teaching. But I went into business and then the</p><p> war came and the --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, you had been working for how many years before the war came?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Let's see, 19 -- about eight years in business.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: About eight years in --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My last job was in a town called Guildford in Surrey in England, and it was with the</p><p> Abbey Road Building Society where I worked as a bookkeeper -- sorry --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You were about 25 years old then when the war started?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. And before the war started I had been involved somewhat with the Quakers and</p><p> their work and the victims of the Spanish Civil War. And, in fact, my wife is a Basque</p><p> from the north of Spain. When the Spanish Civil War broke out, the British government</p><p> sent over a mission to bring over children from Spain to England to look after them while</p><p> the war was going on. The idea was that it would be a temporary arrangement. And with</p><p> every 40 children they sent one teacher. And they asked various cities all over England if</p><p> they would take one group of these children. And the city where I was working, Guildford,</p><p> said they would take a group. And they asked for volunteers, and I volunteered to help</p><p> prepare the hostel where the kids were going to live. And then later they asked me if I</p><p> would go and live in the hostel, because there were 40 children and two girls, two teachers,</p><p> a teacher and a teacher's aid. And there were a lot of chores to do about the house, and</p><p> they wanted some manpower, so they asked me to go live in the house. I went to live in the The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, was this your first association with the Quakers?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Had you done other kinds of volunteer -- other volunteer work similar to that</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> previously?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But that had some special appeal to you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I was there, you know. The children came to Guildford, and then one of my</p><p> friends was a Quaker, who was very much involved in developing this project. And he</p><p> said, you know, we need somebody to help, how about it? And I said, fine.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So it was through a friend in large part?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: A friend, yes. So then also I had some kind of sympathy with the Quaker point of view.</p><p> In fact, I was a conscientious objector during the war and worked on the land when I was</p><p> called up, and had in the meantime registered with the Quakers as a volunteer for any work</p><p> they wanted me to do. And in 1944 --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Could you -- could we back up? Could you say a little bit more about the working on</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> the land? You were called up for the Army and you said that you were a conscientious</p><p> objector?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I went to the tribunal and they were very fair, I guess. They listened to what I had to say</p><p> and their first response was, well, we think you are quite sincere, but wrong, and so you</p><p> had better go work in the Army medical corps. And I said, no, I wouldn't do that because</p><p> that would mean I wouldn't be bearing witness that I was a conscientious objector because The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

And so</p><p> then they went back and forth some more. And they came back and said, in that case you</p><p> will work on the land. And I said, well, that's fine.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you did that in what capacity? Was it a government unit that you were with?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, no, they gave me so many days to find a job on the land.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And I went to one of the local farmers and he looked at me in my office clothes and</p><p> kind of grinned and he said, well, I disagree with you, but I need -- we need workers, and</p><p> if you want to come and work for me, you can. But you are going to have to work as a --</p><p> just like a laborer. There is no fancy business. And so I did. I worked on the land and --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was that a difficult decision for you to make? To take that course?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, because -- because lots of people that I very greatly admired disagreed with me.</p><p> My own family --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Your family disagreed?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, they didn't support me. I mean, my brother-in-law was an officer in the Army and</p><p> my brothers were both ministers at that time, and so that one of my brothers was working</p><p> for the Navy. So I was the only one who became a conscientious objector and went to a</p><p> tribunal and so forth. But the family were very supportive, again, they didn't agree with</p><p> me, but that didn't affect their affection for me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was there -- did you have anybody or any people who did agree with you and could</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> support you with their agreement?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, of course, a lot of the Quakers were passivists. And on the land, I was working on The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

And so that, well, you weren't entirely alone. On the other hand, there were a lot of</p><p> people who very vehemently disagreed with us and didn't -- didn't bother to hide their</p><p> feelings. Indeed, when I got married, in those days accommodation was very difficult and</p><p> you were appointed places to live. That is to say, if you couldn't find a place -- and</p><p> teachers had a priority. And my wife was teaching in the nursery school for little children,</p><p> so she had a priority and she got a place, found a place. But when we went there, the</p><p> landlady said -- looked at me and said I understand you are a conscientious objector, and I</p><p> said yes. And she said, well, you're not going to live in my house. And so we had to go</p><p> find somewhere else. But --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you did get a lot of hostility?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, yes. Not a lot, but enough to make you realize that you were in an awkward</p><p> position. And it was a difficult --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Excuse me --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was an awkward situation, after all. It was what everybody felt was a very just war. I</p><p> felt the cause was just, I just didn't believe that war would ever answer it. And so that you</p><p> are living in -- England was in a pretty rough position from the beginning, the first few</p><p> years. It was very difficult. We had all sorts of, you know, military preparations fora</p><p> possible invasion going on, so that kind of mindset. But I just went out and worked and did</p><p> my job on the land. And in the meantime I had, as I said, registered with the Quakers that I</p><p> was on their list of potential volunteers.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, this was a list of volunteers who would go overseas?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Um-hmm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And so then in 1944 they called me up.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Excuse me. But somewhere along here you got married; is that right?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. It was very important, 1942 I got married.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So that was after you were working on the land?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, after working on the land.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Ihave to stop for a minute.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> {Pause.}</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You were talking about that you got married in 1942?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And that was while you were working on the land?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The mission for the children was arranged by the Basque government, and in</p><p> conjunction with and in response to this invitation from England they would take these</p><p> children. And so Juanita was just finishing her career, her education as a teacher, and so</p><p> she volunteered to come with the children.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But it was -- she volunteered to the Basque government when they were looking for</p><p> teachers to go with the children. And when the -- the end of the Spanish Civil War, when</p><p> that home was closed down, and some of the children went back to Spain and some went</p><p> to France where their parents were refugees, she became a teacher in an English nursery</p><p> school, in a wartime nursery for children of mothers who were working in the factories.</p><p> And this was in Guildford. And just near Guildford was the factory where they made the</p><p> Churchill tanks. And there were a lot of women working there, so they had this nursery</p><p> school right by the factory and she taught there. And so she was teaching there and I was</p><p> working on the land. We -- at first we thought we would not get married till the war was</p><p> over, but we had been engaged since 1939 or something, and by 1942 we decided why wait</p><p> any longer, because there seemed to be no prospect the war was going to be over any</p><p> quick moment. So we got married and I -- just after that in 1944, as I say, the Quakers got</p><p> in touch with me and said they wanted me to come up to London to go to their training</p><p> institute to work for -- to join the team that was to go and work in Europe. And so I did, I</p><p> left the job in Guildford. And this was an acceptable alternative under the laws which</p><p> govern me being a conscientious objector, this was something I could do. And so I was The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was wonderful, because they did everything -- their objective was not to make you</p><p> into a highly-skilled technician or anything like that, but to make you into a person who</p><p> could cope with things without the usual facilities. So, I mean, they had the -- in the team</p><p> there were social workers and people like that. But the training was more to teach you how</p><p> to cope with new situations. So they had a lot of, kind of, make-believe. We lived in a big</p><p> house in Hampstead and they would -- one day they would decide that this house was a</p><p> refugee center and that thousands of refugees were coming out of Germany and they had</p><p> to be taken care of. So half the team would be the people looking after the house and the</p><p> other half of the team would be the refugees. And they were instructed to behave like</p><p> people who are very desperate, who didn't trust anybody after their treatment in Germany,</p><p> so they wouldn't want to be registered, they wouldn't want to have their names taken. And</p><p> our job was to learn to try and cope with them and, yes, it was -- it sounds a bit odd, but it</p><p> was really very useful. Another day they -- they said, well, we just had an air raid and there</p><p> is no -- the house is being destroyed and so we have got to make do. And so we were</p><p> shoved out in the garden. And in the garden there were just a few vegetables that have to</p><p> be in the garden, and we were told to find a way of keeping ourselves alive for the day.</p><p> We were told to dig up the potatoes and make some soup out of boxes because there were</p><p> no stoves or anything. And so it was this idea of being on your own, having to do things</p><p> that you had never done before, and not running away from the job. And that certainly was</p><p> very useful.</p><p>The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you train with the team that you eventually worked with?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you started together from the beginning?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, we started together as kind of a miscellaneous group, but then they gradually</p><p> selected the people that were going to be on the team. And then we went on training as a</p><p> team and we were supposed to go to Holland.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Before we do that, as part of the training was religion a big part or any part of the</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> training?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Quaker -- Quaker practices were part of the training. We went -- in our team, I think</p><p> there were only two Quakers, people who were -- people who were members of a Friends</p><p> Meeting. The rest of us were Baptists, Congregationalists, Jews and -- but we did have --</p><p> we started all our like team meetings, discussion groups, with a fairly long period of</p><p> silence, which is, you know, the way the Quakers generally prepare themselves for -- in</p><p> their religious service. So we were very much aware that we represented the Quakers and</p><p> that we would be expected to behave like -- carry out the principles of the Friends. And</p><p> this did -- this was an important factor because subsequently when we were working in</p><p> Germany under the -- while the war was on, and afterwards and the occupation, there were</p><p> times when what the military authorities wanted us to do and what the Quakers would</p><p> think would be the appropriate thing to do weren't quite the same. And so we had to face</p><p> up to that.</p></p></dialogue>

And the technique was the family just had to leave and find their own</p><p> place and the house was taken over by the occupation authorities. We didn't -- we realized</p><p> that we had to be housed somewhere. We realized that the family that we were -- to whom</p><p> the house belonged were obviously very unhappy about the whole situation.So we came to</p><p> a compromise. So we -- two or three members of the family lived in the very top floor of</p><p> the house, which we didn't have to use, and we took over the rest of the house so that we</p><p> didn't feel that we were kind of being part of an action to take the property away from</p><p> the family. Plus, obviously, the army would have given it back to the family eventually.</p><p> But in the meantime they were very anxious to be able to keep some out of the place. That</p><p> was only a little example.

Well, as it happened, we never did go to</p><p> Holland.

There was one woman who was</p><p> I think in her mid 40s or perhaps even later than that. She was the oldest of the lot. But,</p><p> you know, we kind of spread around in our lodgings and so on. And we, of course, had</p><p> our own cooking things, field kitchen and all that kind of thing, and we were situated in a</p><p> school that was our center of activity. And, you know, an empty school. And so it was</p><p> some job to put all this stuff, get all our personal belongings and the team belongings and</p><p> the team equipment and get it all packed up in our -- we had five vehicles attached to us,</p><p> one ambulance -- two ambulances, one big truck and two small personnel trucks.</p><p> And we were on the road at six o'clock the next morning.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Hugh Jenkins, tape one, side B. You were saying that you arrived in Belson on April --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Sunday, April the 22nd. The camp, I think, was -- had been found just about a week</p><p> before. And that's the day -- I arrived in Belson on Saturday, on Saturday evening. And</p><p> then on Sunday, when we got ourselves a place to park ourselves, I went into the camp on</p><p> Sunday, the 21st -- the 22nd to Camp No. 211, which was the place where they had kept</p><p> all the children. One of the magnificent things about the camp was the fact that -- well, let</p><p> me go back a bit. The camp was in terrible state because it had, by lack of concern and so</p><p> forth, it had been allowed to get into a horrible condition. It was originally a camp for</p><p> about 3,000 people and there were about 50,000 people in there. There were, I think, 600</p><p> people in a hut that was designed for 50 and they were layered. But despite that, and then</p><p> as the last days before the camp was overtaken, everything broke down, food, no food</p><p> supply, no water supply. And -- but despite that, the people had put the children -- the</p><p> inmates, not the -- the authorities, had put the children all into one barrack where they</p><p> could look after them specially. And whereas in those last days it was a kind of every man</p><p> for himself as far as food was concerned, they made sure that the children were looked</p><p> after as best as they could in those terrible conditions. And my first job was to drive an</p><p> ambulance down into the camp and start getting the children out. The arrangement was</p><p> that about three miles up the road from the camp, the concentration camp, there was a big</p><p> German Army establishment which, of course, was empty and -- but it had big concrete</p><p> buildings, you know, barracks and so on. So that was made into a reception center. And</p><p> the -- between the concentration camp and the new camp, there was what was known as a</p><p> kind of human laundry. And we had -- the ambulances were divided into two groups. And The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

But there they had set up a whole -- an</p><p> arrangement for disinfecting and cleaning people up and so on. And then the other side of</p><p> this place there were clean ambulances which were going from the -- from this place to the</p><p> new -- to the new establishment. So that there was a kind of an insulation between the</p><p> diseases and the lice and everything that the people, that the camp inmates had, that were</p><p> all washed off and disinfected and stripped of their clothing and wrapped in a clean</p><p> blanket. And then the other end of the -- the other side of the building, they would be</p><p> loaded into another ambulance which took them to the -- to this new establishment. So</p><p> you had one series of ambulances going between the camp of what they called the human</p><p> laundry and another series of ambulances going from the laundry to the new camp.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So there were dirty ambulances taking them and then clean ambulances after they got</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> through their laundry?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They were kept separate, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you were driving one of the dirty ambulances?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. And so that was my first job, going in and helping get these children out of the --</p><p> out of the -- then because I was the truck driver in charge of the big truck. Well, one of the</p><p> things, when we first arrived there, the authorities would not allow the girls, the female</p><p> members of the team to enter the concentration camp. There were seven girls and five</p><p> men. But the men were all assigned to work in the camp and the girls were all assigned to</p><p> work in the new, you know, reception center in the hospital.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What do you think the reasoning was for that?</p></p></dialogue>

There were -- the SS guards were still there. They were being forced to help bury the dead, and the SS women were still there. And it was pretty rough kind of situation and I think that the people in authority felt that they didn't want to risk the girls going into the camp.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: For their physical safety or just what they would have to --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I think probably it was such a -- it was -- it was such an outrageous situation.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>Nobody, you know, people had heard of Auschwitz and the death camp and so on. But Belson was different. Belson -- nobody really knew about Belson until it was discovered because it had never been identified particularly as an extermination camp. So you had this peculiarly -- {beeping sound} -- turn that off -- had this peculiarly unsettled and unpleasant situation. And I guess the Army authorities in charge, they had the Army medical corps men working there, and in any case there were so many jobs to be done because what we were really doing was creating a new -- creating a hospital as we went along --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Um-hmm.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- you know. Empty buildings and so on were being furnished and all the supportive services that you have in a hospital were trying to be set up as quickly as possible to cope with the situation. We -- a lot of the first things I think they did, we I think were the very first people, non Army people in the camp. We went up -- there were six teams that were called in, I think five -- four Red Cross teams and one girls -- girl guides team, and the one Quaker team were called in in that very first appeal for immediate help. But then soon after that they got a whole group of volunteer young medical students from England who The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

But it was a -- it was the kind of thing to begin with when everybody was doing</p><p> whatever immediately needed to be done. There was not a highly organized and orderly</p><p> procedure because you had the terrible pressure of the fact that while we were evacuating</p><p> the camp I think another 15,000 died. 25,000 were -- were saved, were taken to the new</p><p> camp. But it was very, very haphazard. So, for example, after that first run in the</p><p> ambulance, I was sent off in my truck and told to find whatever I could that would be</p><p> useful for the camp. Bed linen, towels.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: This is outside of the camp?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. So I went to the -- where this German establishment, military establishment was,</p><p> there was a set of big houses which belonged to the high command. And the first place I</p><p> went was there. I went through all the places -- all the houses.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were the houses empty?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yes. The Germans had gone a long time -- well, not a long time ago, but had gone.</p><p> And so I used to go around picking up, getting all the bed linen, all the towels, all the</p><p> kitchen utensils, anything that I could pick up in my truck and take it back to the new camp</p><p> to help furnish it. And then after that we discovered -- I think it was our team that</p><p> discovered that there were around the camp a number of farms which had vegetables,</p><p> leeks, carrots and what have you, you know, just lying unharvested. And so my job from</p><p> then on was to go out every day and go around and scour around the countryside and find</p><p> out where there was a field of leeks or vegetable garden and so on and get local -- I worked</p><p> with a -- a German local fellow who helped me identify a place where -- a local inhabitant</p><p> who knew the country.

And I would take them in my truck, which had a big Red Cross flag on the front of it, and take them to this field and stay with them all the while they were working, because they wouldn't work unless they had the protection of the truck and the Red Cross flag. And when we got -- when we got the load of vegetables, I would take these people back to the village and then would take the food back to the camp kitchens, and that's what I did most of the time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was the attitude of this young German man toward you and your efforts?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, he was very helpful. He wasn't -- he was -- I'm not sure how much of a resister he was, but he certainly wasn't -- he was very anti Nazi. And he was known in the district for being a very -- I forget what his job was. I think he was working in some factory or something. Anyhow, he was quite well respected and known in the district, and so he helped me organize this. But some of the people, of course, were not very friendly.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [remember one lady who we went to her farm. She was married to some high official, who wasn't there, of course. And she was grumbling about the fact that, you know, these workers, they are terrible, the moment they got the chance they ran away. These are forced laborers, mind you. I said, well, what did you expect them to do? And so she was going on about this. And I said to her, you see that? You know that place over there, that concentration camp? And she said, well, she kind of denied knowing anything about it. So Itold her what it was like there, and the Red Cross was there, because she was so unsympathetic. Lots of the people were.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you there when that happened?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Inside the camp?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. It was really kind of a first aid stand. Our main -- obviously, the whole priority</p><p> was getting the people out. We had a kind of a scoreboard we used to keep of the number</p><p> of people we evacuated each day. Like a competition, you know.

So we had to kind of have it open from 9:00 in the morning until 6:00 in the evening or something. I used to go down there occasionally to take some supplies or something. And, obviously, I went one day when we had to close the camp, close the doors. And it was a terrible job because there were people outside that probably spent the last two days gradually making their way to this thing because they couldn't walk, they, you know, they were too weak to just walk there. So you felt that, at least I felt, you know, when you looked at these people and you thought, my gosh, some of them will probably be dead before the camp -- before the place is open in the morning. And when I was closing the camp a young girl came up to me and said you must give me something for my mother. She is very ill. And I said, well, the aid center is closed. And she said but you must get me something. So I went inside and got some aspirins and gave them to her and said, well, maybe these will help your mother. It was just a gesture. I didn't know, the mother wasn't there. But, on the other hand, the girl was so desperate to have somebody do something. And about three or four -- three weeks later when we were in the -- when the camp was emptied eventually and it was burned down and all the people that were in the camp were now in this new -- in this new establishment, this young lady came up to me and said, oh, you are the man who saved my mother's life. And I -- because I didn't recognize her because before I had seen her in a concentration camp, filth, you know, now she was -- after the camp was dressed nicely and so on.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, it was burned hut by hut. But it was obviously -- it was kind of accelerated as</p><p> time went on. To begin with, obviously, it was very dangerous to start burning once you</p><p> evacuated a hut. You couldn't burn it right away because there were huts all around.</p></p></dialogue>

The camp was under the control, obviously, of the British Army, but they had a</p><p> lot of Hungarian soldiers who were prisoners of war as it were, who were used to work in</p><p> the camp doing various jobs. Another of my jobs was to report to the person in charge to</p><p> take these men down to hut number so-and-so where we have a clean-up job to do or --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were they strong enough to work?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yeah, these were Hung -- these were not camp inmates. These were part of the</p><p> Hungarian Army. When the camp was taken over the by the British, it was taken over ina</p><p> truce between the Eighth Army, the British Eighth Army and the German Army,</p><p> whichever it was, the idea being to create a sanitation zone and there would be no fighting</p><p> in that zone. So that you wouldn't have -- that was the great problem that when -- to begin</p><p> with everybody was afraid of, but this camp was a, a hive of illness, tuberculosis, typhus</p><p> and everything you can think of. And people were afraid, I think, the Germans were afraid</p><p> that if the fighting went through that zone, then people in the camp would all get out and</p><p> start trying to find their way back home and then you would have kind of a wave of</p><p> diseased people off on their own. And so it was arranged that the camp should be handed</p><p> over intact by the Germans to the British and with the condition that all the people, the</p><p> Germans who had been working in the camp as guards and so on, would have to be --</p><p> would be retained there, whereas the German Army retreated from that area and the British</p><p> entered without fighting.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, to begin with we had a very interesting job. Very temporary. The railways in Germany had all been very badly bombed. And after the war they were reconstructing the, well, they were reconstructing the railways. So thousands of forced laborers who wanted to get back to their homes in Holland and France and so on, and so they had trains coming into Germany to the point where the German railways were bombed and trucks coming out of Germany to this point where the -- where the railway started. And the people were transferred from trucks to the train. And our job was to -- to assist in this transfer. People had all sorts of problems and there was a question of food and things like that. To get the people off the trucks and into the trains and the trains went back to say Belgium, Holland, France and so on. And we did that for -- not for very long, about a week or so, because very quickly the railway was repaired to another station farther on, and so -- and then we were sent to Brunswick, and we -- that was our biggest and most time-consuming job. We eventually became in charge of a huge Polish camp of 3,500 Poles, and the Quaker team, the 12 of us administered it.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was that like?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, it was -- it was very interesting because, see, it was a very difficult situation in</p><p> some ways because the Poles consider themselves -- considered themselves the first</p><p> fighters in the war. They were the first country attacked by Germany. And they, of course,</p><p> the country was very badly beaten up. And the Germans were very bad to the Poles</p><p> because they considered them kind of second-class citizens and brought them in for forced</p><p> labor and so -- but when the war was over the Poles kind of felt, well, you know, they</p><p> ought to be all considered heros because they were the ones who first started to fight the</p><p> Germans. And so they used to get -- and they wanted to go home, but they couldn't go</p><p> home because there was a problem inside Poland as to who was going to govern the</p><p> country. So they lived in this camp and we -- we looked after them, you know. We were</p><p> the kind of town council -- like city government. One was looking after schools, one was</p><p> looking after clothing. I was in charge of what was known as the camp commandant, and it</p><p> was quite fun. Well, fun isn't the word.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, the most obvious one, obviously, was its relationship to my being a conscientious</p><p> objector. I remember standing in the camp very early on and looking at the terrible -- and I</p><p> guess the people who upset me most in the camp were the living because they -- the</p><p> walking dead as it were. They were so -- I mean, there were people who had gone beyond The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

The dead were dead and they were in peace. But the -- and the ones who were -- the survivors were getting out of the camp. But, in the meantime, there were these thousands of people dying. And they were the people, I guess, who upset me most because you see them walking around, walking from nowhere to nowhere, and then they would just kind of fall down and there you were. I remember thinking to myself, well, you know, while I was working on the land and the sun was shining, but under this same sky only relatively a few miles away, because England isn't all that far from Germany, these people were living under the same sky and comparing the, you know, the fact that they were so hopeless and without any -- any hope of being saved or anything because, well, before the war ended, I mean, all the while the concentration camps were going, they were going on for eternity, I mean, the people -- the Germans gave up the camps only when the war was at their very doorstep. And so day after day these people were in this camp and having to live under these terrible conditions. And it made me think about being a conscientious objector and refusing to participate in the struggle. And I thought about it a great deal. The only thing I could -- the only conclusion I kept on coming to was that I still believed that war was not the answer. That there must be some other answer. And that eventually we had to get -- we had to get rid of war as a means of settling things. And the only way we will do that is if -- hopefully the next generation there will be conscientious people that feel the same kind of mind and eventually come to a time where people will say we are not going to have an army, we are not going to have arms, there have to be other ways of settling our differences. And that's -- may seem kind of high- minded theory, but on the other hand, that was as far as I got.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And do you have some of those thoughts now?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, except a sense of desolation when I see the way we seem to have -- still use war as</p><p> a method of settling -- maybe that also has an argument in the fact that the third -- the</p><p> Second World War didn't solve problems. There are just as many problems in Europe,</p><p> people fighting each other. So, obviously, there must be some other way. But whatever the</p><p> way was, it was too late to save all the people who were victims of the Nazis.

Well, the team was in charge of the camp. But</p><p> my particular job was kind of the chief administrator, I guess, whatever you call it, which</p><p> was kind of fun because it put me in some very awkward situations. I remember the 3,500</p><p> Poles, we had a Polish police force of young Poles who kind of ran the place, who looked</p><p> after the security of the place. And, of course, we had a lot of young people in there. And</p><p> one day there had been some fighting and the police brought these -- had to break it up and</p><p> they brought these young men in to me as camp administrator to be punished. And so I</p><p> gave them a nice Quakerly lecture about we all ought to live together like we were</p><p> members of a family and things like that and sent them off.

We get beaten up in the process.</p><p>And eventually we manage to settle everything and we bring the ringleaders in to see you, and you tap them on the head and say, well, go home and be good boys. That's not going to work. So I consulted with myself and my friends and decided we would have to have some kind of system. And so I used to dock them their cigarette rations and things like that. Which, of course, in those days was cigarettes were a form of currency practically.</p><p>Everybody loved to smoke. That was quite a punishment to be told you were losing one month's ration of cigarettes. But I left the camp and went back to England. Oh, in the meantime, my wife had joined me because she was -- she also became a member of the Quaker elite and was trained in the same place where I was trained. And then she was sent out to join me in the camp. And she was by that time a very highly- qualified and very experienced nursery school teacher and so she came and looked after the -- because we had a lot of children of all ages, little children in the camp, she set up the nursery school in the camp and she set it up so well that the UNRA, United Nations Rehabilitation Agency, were running a lot of the camps, came to our camp and saw the nursery school and borrowed her and sent her to other camps to set up nursery schools. Then we both left and were assigned to this job of working with the young Spaniards, well, all the Spanish refugees in the south of France, because at the end of the Spanish Civil War there was a tremendous wave of refugees who fled over the frontier into France. And while a lot of them had gone back, a lot were still there. And the ones that were still there were very much in need of various social services.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yeah, yeah. That was kind of -- I was responsible for all the work in Germany,</p><p> Austria, Poland, wherever it was.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And that was a big job?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, yeah, except in the Quaker thing you had the responsibility, but you also -- you</p><p> work very much as a group. We had a committee that was in charge, so -- so I was the</p><p> overseas secretary. I also had a -- I used to work very closely with the people in Friends</p><p> House in London. But I used to have to travel to Poland to meet -- visit the teams. And</p><p> then the Friends Relief Service was a temporary organization that -- it was kind of</p><p> peculiar. The Friends in England did not have a permanent service group. What they did</p><p> was to create a group or a service in time of need. So, for example, as I remember, there</p><p> was one Quaker service in Ireland during the potato famine. There was one Quaker service</p><p> in the Franco-Prussian War. There was one Quaker service in the First World War. And</p><p> there was one Quaker service in the Second World War. And the Quaker service in the</p><p> Second World War was -- it was agreed, long before the war ended it was agreed that</p><p> failing any other unforeseen events, that would come to an end in May 1948.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Friends Relief Service. And it was to come to an end in May 1948. So that was the</p><p> period that I was the overseas secretary.

It was a difficult job because -- and everybody falls</p><p> in love -- when you are in relief work you fall in love with your work and you fall in love</p><p> with the people you are working with. I mean -- I don't mean fall in love with individuals,</p><p> but you fall in love with the whole situation and your companions and the local -- and it is</p><p> very difficult to leave. You feel, you know, the job is not finished, why should we have to</p><p> leave? But, on the other hand, the Quakers, I believe, felt very strongly that this was a job</p><p> that they had to do in time of need, but they weren't about to start a permanent social</p><p> service agency. Or they do have continuing programs right now that the British and the</p><p> American Quakers, you know, countries where there are -- where there is need. And so I</p><p> did that until May 1948. And then in May 1948 the American Friends Service Committee</p><p> said, well, you've been working for British Friends Relief Service, and now that job is</p><p> finished, why don't you come work with us for a little while.

So we came to Washington in 1951 to run the International</p><p> Student House, which we did for six years. And we never left.
