<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you children used to hear that?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, they argued. What did they argue about? Money. I think my father probably had a relationship with somebody, and my mother just simply did not have much respect for my father.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Ooh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They just -- it j -- it just was not a happy couple.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They do not abuse each other openly, or in front of us, and was not much arguing. But they just was -- I think in some ways, my father loved my mother, but he just never measured up to her expectations.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, you described what she thought of him, what did -- how would you characterize your parents" personalities? <span class="page-break" number="29"></span> Interview with Danguole Gabis 8 December 10, 2015</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He was -- my father was easygoing, I would say. And I think he really loved my mother. It's just that she did not really love him, and he could just not measure up to what she expected of him.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's pretty harsh.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's pretty harsh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. So it was not -- it was not a happy marriage. And they were both very caring, as far as we were concerned, the children. But --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you closer to one, or to the other?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think as a little girl, I probably leaned more -- more towards my mother, but not really, because they were wise enough to never, in front of us, bring their troubles, bring their dis-disputes, and try to tell us, oh, he is not good, or she is not good.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They never did that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. So it would be what you had overheard, and just the general sense --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: That's what I were -- that's what I overhear, that he is not ambitious enough, that he is not really supporting his family the way he should, that he is not working hard enough. Mostly that was coming from my mother.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did that express itself?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, my father was much more open and loving and fun, where I don't remember my mother playing with us much. I mean, she made sure that we looked as good as possible. When you see that photograph, we are wearing beautiful, red velvet outfits, with my brother. I remember the -- they would -- expected me to do well in school, when I started going to school. But I would say my mother was not very affectionate, whereas my father was. My -- my father would not -- would -- was not much of a disciplinary person, and he was not much of a -- he was very easygoing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So in some ways, all of this fell to your mother.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And I-I think so, because I would take them out whatever I -- whenever I decided to go and browse around.

I think maybe they lived somewhat better than -- than my family. I don't think they had any children. The townspeople basically had their friendships in their own social class. They had their jobs.

And he would come and visit us. <span class="page-break" number="42"></span> Interview with Danguole Gabis *deg December 10, 2015</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> But my mother was basically in charge of the family, and pretty much probably, of family finances. So he did go into [indecipherable] some way, I unders -- my understanding was. And --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It sounds like a separation.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, kind of. And then, as far as the town goes, there were no cars. Everybody would come and went there with sleighs, horses and sleighs. And we kids would love to run after the sleighs, get hold of the back of the sleigh and go for a ride, which was very dangerous, because you could fall down and be trampled by other horses, so you had -- you were not allowed to do it, you had to sneak out to do it.</p><p>And was very safe.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That involved, as all borders have, patrols. At least at that time, I'm sure they do now. And he was in charge of that -- of a stretch of a border, in charge of the patrols.</p><p>I guess he would ride out. He had a beautiful horse, I remember that.

And he would ride out there and check on the patrols, I suppose. I think now and then, maybe every six months, or once a year, some kind of a superiors would arrive, and he had prison documents. I remember it because my mother would fill these documents out for him at the last minute, so everything looked okay. That's what I understood.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>

That is, here you live in independent Lithuania. By 1938, you're already a nine year old girl.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And I'm sure that nobody -- but I'm leading you here, maybe it's true that people did know about it, but from what I have heard, most people didn't know about this pact that they had signed.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We had no information, and I never heard about anything.

Which was a disgrace.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. So that was something that was --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was already when the Germans came in.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see. Okay --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But first we have to deal with the Russians. So what I heard about Russian occupation, I had not -- in Jaimalas(ph), I haven't seen any police, or -- I mean, soldiers coming in, or anything. The library was running like it did before, no change.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What about school?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Huh? <span class="page-break" number="48"></span> Interview with Danguole Gabis ~ December 10, 2015</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What about school?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Schools were running, however they brought in an organization called [indecipherable] pioneers.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. So the -- did your teachers change? Did new teachers come in?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, the same teachers. And I think there could have been classes about communism, and how the common man was -- there were -- there were probably some people in town who liked the idea that it was -- everybody's going to be equal type of a thing, but I don't know. I do know that the farmers were very concerned, because they were required by the gub -- by the government now, to deliver so much food, grains of all kinds, maybe even animals to their government. For which they got paid, but very little. So slowly -- you know, depending how much land you had, it looked like slowly you will have to sell it -- to leave it, because you will not able to -- to have enough to deliver to the government. And after that, they would start building kolhauses(ph). Kolhauses(ph) is a farm that the land belongs to the state, and everybody works there, for the state. So that was going along, and -- but as far as my life, or I would say, my mother's life, did not change. She still worked in the library. I still went to school.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: He just wasn't there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He wasn't there. I do remember that once he showed up to -- just to make sure that everybody saw him, that he was still alive, and there, and -- and then di -- disappeared again. And then just before the deport -- huge deportation was staged, he came home, and I have a feeling that the people knew, or sensed, or heard something, that something is going to happen. So, my father or my mother, I'm not sure who, got in touch with my -- my uncles, and they came, and they picked us three up.</p></p></dialogue>

And she said she didn't tell them anything. So she then ended in camps way out the Altai mountains. And it was very difficult. She had had, at one point, some training as a nurse. So for a while, she actually helped out in one camp, as a nurse, and she caught TB. She almost died. And then they -- they worked in the fields, and she said sometimes the peasants from the area would leave packages of food in the fields for them, for the prisoners, because they knew they were starving.</p><p>She said by that time, a cat appeared in the camp.

And so she -- she went back ho -- back to Lithuania.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So that -- if she w -- was there for 15 years, that means it would have been 1956 that she would have been released from her servitude.</p></p></dialogue>

Thank you for sharing this. I think we'll take a break now. [break] All right. So, before the break, we were talking about what had happened your -- with your mother, what her destiny was, and one thing that I wanted to see if we could bring some clarity to, would have been, what was the reason for her deportation? Why would she have been taken? Can you supply any explanation for that?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I do not have any specific informations. What I heard people talking about, that there were more people -- she was not the only one from the town that was taken, there were more people taken from that town. I think the mayor of the town, and his family. And 1-if it -- it's strange -- strange coincidence, one of the daughters, small daughter of that family, was staying with her grandparents in the village, and she was left.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: So everybody was taken in the family, but her. And she grew up and actually came to United States. And from the people there was a feeling that they were trying to pick up better educated people, and probably people that might have been a problem. I had never heard anything said that my mother would have been picked up because of my father. I haven't heard that at all. <span class="page-break" number="71"></span> ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion Interview with Danguole Gabis a December 10, 2015</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Why would she then, have been picked up? If not because of your father, what would be the -- the reason?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But I think it's nobody was given any reason. They just showed up and said you are going, period. That is my understanding. There were all these people, they're taken from -- from this town, and it was a massive deportation all across the country. People were taken from other cities, too, and shipped straight out to -- to -- to Soviet Union. And much later on, one of my uncles and his family were deported. That was during the 40s.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: After the war?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. When the Russians stayed in Lithuania.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay. So there was no -- your mother had a feeling --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: There was no -- there was no specific charge. It was not like somebody showed up and said okay, you" ve wrote this pamphlet, or your belong to this group, and that's why you will have to go.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They -- from what happened to my mother probably happened to very many people.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't know if that is true. I really don't know. And as far as I was concerned, the way I found out, I told you how I found out about it, nobody ever explained to me why she was taken. He just said there were a pla -- many other people taken.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember missing her?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, I miss her terribly. The -- everybody -- I mean, my sister was tiny still, she was seven years -- she's seven years younger. So my sister, she said that -- she told me much later, now actually, that for a long time she thought maybe she did something, that's why the mother was gone.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And it's just one of these things that happened. And, in a strange way though, now of course, I would question it -- if anything that -- like that would happen, or similar, I would be questioning everywhere. But at that time I was small, the war was going on, and nobody -- and never asked any questions. I never asked any questions, and nobody explained to me.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was then not staying with my fa -- with any of my family. We were separated, the three children, and I was staying with some other people. And then eventually heard that the Russians left, and the Germans came, and as far as I was concerned, and the people around me were glad to see Germans, because the Russians were beginning to confiscate the farms, and impose all kinds of restrictions like that. And the times in the country became more difficult. So they thought well, occupation -- at least some of them would say, well, at least they believe in God.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, yes. And he was not working at -- well, in my mind, I assumed that we have a Lithuanian government now.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That was your assumption at the time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. That the Russians have left. And so the Germans were there, but then -- in the country, but they were there to kind of protect us from Russians. And I -- if I don't re -- I don't remember why, but I do think there was some quasi-Lithuanian government. How real, how unreal, or am | imagining it, I don't remember.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [remember my school that I liked. The children were friendly. I also remember that there was a --a Polish population in town.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But there was a Polish population in school also, and at one point, I think there were classes in school, were given in Polish.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you ever go to any of those classes?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. <span class="page-break" number="82"></span> Interview with Danguole Gabis a December 10, 2015</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They were -- they were discontinued. Everything was in Lithuanian. What ha -- say -- what -- if you know Lithuanian history, that part of Lithuania, Vilnius and all around there, at one point it was in Polish hands. After 1918, the Poles, they -- they were there, and the Lithuanians could not get the land back. So only when the -- first the Russians, the communists came to Lithuania, they brought this country, these parts of Lithuania, back to the Lithuanian Republic then. And the Germans also had it all in the Lithuanian Republic. Actually, when my father was working in Sveneionys, we have gone to Vilnius, excuse me, to visit with some priest that my sis -- my aunt knew.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm. Was that the first time you were in Vilnius ever?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And do you remember any impressions from that visit?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Churches, basically.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: There are a lot of churches there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. And knowing my aunt, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We went to churches. <span class="page-break" number="83"></span> Interview with Danguole Gabis * December 10, 2015</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. So -- so within a number of months, actually one could say rather quickly, your life really turns upside-down, but then gets resettled halfway across the country.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You know, in -- again, if I think about it now, it's very unsettling. However, I was small, I was still very young, and I wasn't the only one who was being resettled everywhere, up and down. It was -- the whole country was being resettled up -- up and down. There -- there was no -- it was not unusual to have to move, and start somewhere else, and I really didn't have a place, some [indecipherable]. My mother was taken, so in Jaimalas(ph) there was nothing for me, anybody else. And --well, the farms, my uncles" farms were okay, but I had to go to school, so I will not have stayed in the village anyway. And I had never been there in winter, so -- so moving to another city, and a -- another town, and another apartment wasn't something that was dra-dramatic for a -- that si-- the -- the har -- hurtful thing was that my mother wasn't there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You missed her.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was difficult.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And though I liked my aunt, I never -- somehow I -- in my silly, little mind, I--I felt that my mother was more worldly, more sophisticated. <span class="page-break" number="84"></span> Interview with Danguole Gabis * December 10, 2015</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was she, in actuality?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, yes, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So ---</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That my aunt was this very religious, country woman, and though she was kind enough -- she was a good woman.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes, but she wasn't your mother.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. I was -- somehow I -- I had warmer memories of my grandmother. We really liked my gra -- were very close to my grandmother.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. Your father would -- did he have an office that he went to?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. Yes, he had an office.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: He had an office. Did you ever visit him there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. I never went there. I never went there, I never saw any Germans around, soldiers. I-- I-- we knew very few people in town. Actually, when I think of it, I don't remember see anybody that we knew, except people through [indecipherable] from my aunt, that in -- at the church. And I remember that the priest tha-that parish priest would give huge, very elaborate Easter breakfast at that parish, and invite some people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And I went to church a great deal, and was involved with the church ceremonies. <span class="page-break" number="85"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Danguole Gabis * December 10, 2015</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did you get communion, first communion? Oh, that was before already.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you get confirmed?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, in Vilnius.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In Vilnius, you got confirmation in Vilnius.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Mm-hm, mm-hm, mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Now, was the -- in some ways what you're describing to me sounds not unusual, because up until the -- those changes, in 1939, to 1941, this was Poland, this was not Lithuania.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So it was a new ni -- it was new territory for a Lithuanian administration. Were there other Lithuanians in Sveneionys, or was -- were they a minority?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Everybody spoke Lithuanian. We -- if you went to the store, or if you went to a restaurant, which we sometimes did, everybody spoke Lithuanian.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And whoever -- in school, whoever was in school with me, spoke Lithuanian.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, you said though that you did know that there were Polish children in your school, and for a little while there were classes in Polish.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not after we came. <span class="page-break" number="86"></span> Interview with Danguole Gabis * December 10, 2015</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Before.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Before.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Before we came, they spoke -- they had Polish, but when we came there, when the Lithuanians had hold of these parts, and then the school was only Lithuanian.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did Polish children, however, attend it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't know if they were Polish or not. They all spoke Lithuanian.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I did not meet anybody in school that spoke Polish.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see. One of the reasons I ask is because in Poland itself, German -- during German occupation, education was severely restricted for Poles. Severely. In some ways, outride forbidden.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And some places, only up until certain grades. So maybe children went to school who were -- Polish children went to school, and were able to continue school, but only if they did it in Lithuanian.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Probably, because the por -- as far -- from what I know, our education was not restricted in any way.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. <span class="page-break" number="87"></span> Interview with Danguole Gabis "!</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>December 10, 2015</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But then, again, there was this -- Germans, from talks around, had something against the Slavs. And Poles were Slavs, and the Lithuanians were not. So I think we might have gotten some preferential treatment.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It's possible. Again, I just heard it as hi-- as gossips, sometimes, a-among some ad-adults.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But when we came there, didn't know anybody.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Now --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And we just moved into the apartment. I was taking piano lessons.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: From whom?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I do know that as time went on, things became more difficult. For example, food became scarce. You could not get meat, or you got very little meat. But we had rabbits, we kept rabbits, and hens, and I think even geese. And a-- I ne -- I don't remember ever going to the store to shop. Whatever was bought, my Aunt Oda(ph) probably went and shopped.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So in some ways it sounds like you were quite sheltered, you know, as children.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. <span class="page-break" number="88"></span> Interview with Danguole Gabis " December 10, 2015</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. I never was asked to do anything. I did not have to make beds, I did not have to -- to help in the kitchen.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you were the oldest, so --</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was your father still as easygoing as he had been before?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: There were times when he would disappear for a couple days or so. There were times that he would be drunk.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh really? Had you ever seen him drunk before?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. There were times -- well, if he was drunk, he was loud, he talked loud. He never talked politics of any sort.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you -- did his manner change, to you, or to the others?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Towards us? No. No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did he --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He was always very gentle with us, and in some ways I felt he was unusually proud of me, because he thought I was very smart, and he thought that to the very end of his life, which is interesting.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So to -- Rita, my sister -- Gerda(ph) my sister was considered very pretty. I was definitely the smart one.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And there wasn't much shopping of any kind. I think whatever clothes we had, they were made over, changed. But --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did you make any new friends in Sveneionys?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I did.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was also just for a short while. When I think of it now, and knowing the history of my father there, I can see that some people probably were avoiding us. I mean, that's what I read into it now. At that time, I had no idea. We were in a place <span class="page-break" number="90"></span> Interview with Danguole Gabis " December 10, 2015</p><p> where I was not familiar. I did not know the place, I did not know the people, I was in anew school. I did pretty well in school.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, what I knew about him. Okay, there -- let's see, how long a time was it that the Germans were there, and then the Russians came back?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I think it was from deg41 to deg44.</p></p></dialogue>

Okay, so when -- at one point, I remember that my father was -- let's see -- yes. We left Sveneionys, and moved to -- where did it -- Kupishkis.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because my father was arrested. I was on the farms. I and my brother were on the farms with our uncles, and my grandmother was in the apartment in Sveneionys, and my uncles went and picked her up. I think also in that period, that summer, at one point, before our uncles, before I went to our farms, we were taken out of town. Now who took us, I don't remember. And we were placed somewhere in a very wooded place, somewhere in the woods, by some family, for a few weeks or a month or so. I'm not sure how long. But then we all come together -- I'm talking children -- and we all left for my uncles" farms. And then, while there, at the end of the summer, time came to go to school, and my uncles rented an apartment for my aunt and the three of us in Kupishkis, so that we could go to school.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So it was another new school?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was another new school. And I haven't lived in Kupishkis before. I didn't even -- was not [indecipherable]. So I went to school there, and when I were -- were -- when we were in Kupishkis, we heard that my father was in prison. No, we -- before we came to Kupishkis, we were still at my uncles" farms, we heard that my <span class="page-break" number="92"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Danguole Gabis 8 December 10, 2015 father was arrested. He was in prison in Vilnius. And so my uncles found out about it. How, I don't know. I remember thinking that it was so unfair. The Russians took my mother, and the Germans put my father in jail. And the school started, we moved to shi-- to Kupishkis, and there was a break in the fall, there was some kind of a holiday, and my aunt was ready to go to Vilnius, visit her father, and I was going to go with her. And just before we left, we received information that he was released.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I see.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The only way -- I think after two -- we mu -- I must have spent two years in a school in Svengionys.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And it would have happened in the summer bef -- after that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So it would be the summer of "43?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Probably, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Now, when you moved to Sveneionys, you mentioned that there was -- it eh -- first of all, it was part of Poland. There were many Polish people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I did not really even know that.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And I know from the history -- by then I knew that there -- because I le-learned some history and geography, that Vilnius, and the part around Vilnius, after 1918 was left for the Poles.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- advantageous, you know. Yes, everybody -- Lithuanians felt good. We have our land back.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm. I see. Now, from what I understand about Sveneionys, it had not only a Polish population, but also a Jewish population before the war. When you went there, when you lived there, do you remember any Jewish shops, do you remember any Jewish people? Do you remember seeing anything on the streets, anybody on the streets?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. And if--I mean, if they -- unless they were dressed differently, or went to s -- if they -- I don't remember seeing a synagogue. I did not remember hearing any Jews in the stores. Just on di-- didn't see any Jews. No -- no Jews ever came to our house, and I don't remember seeing any Jewish children in school. But then that's not surprising because when I was in -- in Sveneioneliai, I did not know if there were any Jewish children in my school.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They would not necessarily would have announced themselves as Jewish, or try to stand out.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you -- did you, as children, know what was happening to the Jews of the country? <span class="page-break" number="95"></span> Interview with Danguole Gabis " December 10, 2015</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. No. I don't know, it might have been discussed among my -- my family, like my uncles and my au -- my grandmother, or even my aunt who lived with us. But they never tried to tell us anything about it -- about the fate of the Jews, or did we ask? Now, why didn't we ask? Perhaps we were scared.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Why would you be scared?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: If people are being arrested, you are scared. If you are small, and people are being arrested, especially if they were people that you knew -- though I did not know any Jews -- I knew Jews in -- in Jaimalas(ph), as store owners. But in Sventionys, when we moved into Sveneionys, I did not meet any Jews. And I--I mean, I know what happened, but by the -- when we arrived there, I would now think that by then the Jews must have been rounded up and moved out of town.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because I know that Germans required that they wear -- wore a yellow star. Now where did I find that out? Was it there, or much later? Probably still in Lithuania, but I never saw anybody wearing it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you ever see somebody wearing ribbons?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That would mark them as Jewish? No.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [really don't think I met any Jews there, or knew what ha -- was happening to the Jews.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Would you have ever thought at that time that your father might have had something to do with it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. I had -- my -- this is -- sounds very stupid, but I had no i -- not really knew what my father's job involved.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's not stupid, you were a child.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It's -- yeah, well, it was security police, or -- there were plenty of reasons to -- to want to be secure. I do remember an incident, because it was so talked about that, very much, at that time. That there was a -- an incident where a German -- two Germans were in car, driving somewhere, not too far from Sveneionys somewhere.</p><p>And they had a translator, a woman. I assume she was a Lithuanian woman. And she was connected with the partisans. We knew there were partisans in the woods.</p><p>And she asked the Germans to stop the car because she needed to go to the woods <span class="page-break" number="97"></span> Interview with Danguole Gabis a December 10, 2015</p><p> to relieve herself. They stopped the car, and the partisans shot them. And then she was arrested. The Germans picked her up, and I remember that there was -- that there were some German nat -- Wehrmacht, with the brown shirts, had appeared in town, ka -- even were in our house, talking to -- to my father, and I remember my father making a remark to somebody that she would be better off dead. And I remember then hearing something that people were -- were shocked because of this.</p><p>I remember that they picked maybe that incident, or some other incident, the Germans picked up some -- a couple men that -- they were not Jews, I think they were Poles, maybe Lithuanians, and shot them on -- they took them to Jewish cemetery and shot them there, though they were not Jewish. And I remember I was very -- I was afraid. But then I don't know where they were buried, or not buried, or what -- or what they were shot for, but I was afraid. And then the Germans kind of disappeared again. There was not -- I did not feel a strong German presence in this -- in Sveneionys, because if you walked to school, if you walked to town, you didn't see them.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. <span class="page-break" number="98"></span> Interview with Danguole Gabis m December 10, 2015</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- like an easy thing to answer.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. You didn't. When this -- things -- things go like that, you don't feel safe. You don't feel safe anywhere. So there were times in my very young life, where I was -- I mean, just the fact that my father was then arrested --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you ever find out what for?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. One did not ask. I mean, these things were -- people were arrested. So, the government, whoever they are at that point, has something against you, so they arrested you. Why? Who knows? The whole system of justice was non-existent. It was on on the whim of the government that was, at that time, in power. That's it.</p><p>They did not have to give any excuses or explanations. You could have been picked up walking down the street, and hauled off.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mim-hm. So --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because it happened. Look, when my mother was taken away, there were thousands of people taken away. So --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So it wouldn't have occurred to ask why. Is that what you're saying?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. Didn't even occur to ask me why.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Well, now --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You know what? And also then, whatever was happening to the Jews at that time, had I even known about it, that they were being arrested and hauled off, it <span class="page-break" number="99"></span> ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion Interview with Danguole Gabis es December 10, 2015 would be just another thing happening. Can you -- another crazy thing happening.</p><p>Scary. It's a very hard life. Very difficult time. It's interesting when I think about it, heck, here I am. Wonder of wonders. I don't even lock my door. I did for a long time, in my life. I did not feel safe. And then, you know, then we -- we were in DP camps.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: We'll talk about this.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But I want to -- I want to still stay with this [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Stay with th -- with this -- with this period in our life.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. Now, at this point, I'II interject this -- how it even is that we come to speak with you today. And that's by mentioning the book that your daughter wrote, your daughter Rita Gabis wrote a book that was published two, three months ago, called "Guest at the Shooter's Banquet." And in it she describes her journey to find out more about what your father's role had been during World War II. In a way, to find out who he was. More of who he was. And I've read the book, and in it I also read that you did not want to know until it was finished. You were going to read it, but not until it was finished, as to what her progress was. Have I -- am | accurate in saying that, or were you involved in her research work?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: About what, the book? <span class="page-break" number="100"></span> </p><p> 104 Interview with Danguole Gabis December 10, 2015</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: About the book, about what she was doing, about her --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I was not at all involved.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. The only -- she came here once, with her husband, and my sister was here, and we had one conversation where I think she wa -- she was in the process of getting the book going. About our life in Svengionys, and what do we remember of the war, and that period. And she did not feel that we gave her a very satisfactory answers, that we knew enough about it. And it's true, you know. When you think of this -- if this -- something like that started happening here, you would be up in arms.</p><p>But I was this young child, the country was up and down, first one invasion, then the other invasion. There was no stable government of any sort. Nobody even taught us about any government, stable or otherwise. So you just kind of stay with your family, and mind your business, and you don't need to ask any questions. The rest was not up to us. The only thing I can say is, what you hear, what you overheard.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, since then -- you've read the book, is that correct?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What is it that you learned, that you didn't know before? <span class="page-break" number="101"></span> Interview with Danguole Gabis .</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>December 10, 2015</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I thought she did a very good job writing the book. I thought she -- not only she wrote a beautiful book -- she's a very good writer -- but also, she did as much research as was needed, and she wrote about things that I am -- truly believe happened.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So -- and these things involve some very bitter and very tough --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- and one could say brutal --</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- events.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And I can under -- I expect her -- I won't say interpretation, because it's not interpretation, it's a fact --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- that was going on. And now, knowing my father, as a grown person, though I always have been his favorite child, and I love him dearly, I know that he was a vain man. I don't think he was a mean man, or a--a cruel man. But I think he was vain, and I think he could have easily fallen into a place where he will do things to promote himself. Now, how far he will go with that -- as the book says, he went pretty far. Just about as far as you can go. But then, none of that was ever discussed <span class="page-break" number="102"></span> Interview with Danguole Gabis aa December 10, 2015</p><p> at the household. Never. And I have no --I really had no idea what a social -- what a chief of security would do, because I never heard of that title.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Never met anybody who was a chief of police -- of security police.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But as -- as Rita writes, it did involve sending out orders to round up Jews. It did involve making sure they were brought to certain places.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And, you know, if I had stayed, let's say, in Jaimalas(ph), where I knew that Jews lived there, and where they lived, now, if th -- I was -- had I stayed there, and know that they disappeared, I would have been more curious. Then I would have known that something is happening, and what is happening.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Someone was there, and now they're gone.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, yeah, that they were arrested or taken away. The -- the talk would be right there about it. I was in -- in a city and town that was larger. I had never been there. I never knew there were any Jews there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And the only thing you see from your father is that sometimes he gets drunk, that he didn't before.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, but then that's also -- my father liked to drink now and then. He never was the -- a man who would sit down and get drunk by himself. But he would love -- he loved company, and he would go -- they would go out and they would drink at <span class="page-break" number="103"></span> ontactrefiranneGaushariarg a hither atrmedortabeattfiexaliaton Interview with Danguole Gabis m7 December 10, 2015 somebody's house usually, very seldom in taverns, or something -- such thing.</p><p>Somebody's house, usually.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: L obviously did not know what's going on. I did not know what was going on with the Jews, and I did not know what my father's part was in it. After everything was over, and I was learning history later on, and I was learning what happened, and thinking of my father in his -- his place there, I can easily understand that she could -- that that could have happened. It did not take me by oh no, my daddy would never do something like that, no.</p></p></dialogue>

And we were married in Chicago, in a little Lutheran chapel on the University of Chicago grounds, because Stanley knew the minister.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And Stanley had no religious traditions. His mother had no religious traditions, and I did not have any Christian traditions beside -- I did have a Christmas tree up, but that was about it. And so, it did not even occur to me that there is something strange that I marry a Jew.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did he -- did you ever have any disagreements with your father because of it?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He was very -- as I say, he -- he would have preferred me that I married a Lithuanian. The language, the history, the traditions. That he was a Jew, and he was not a Lithuanian. He was so American, that I knew more about Jewish customs than he did, really. So, there was never any -- neither at his mother's house, or that Stanley ever had any food restrictions, or -- nothing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But, did you -- share with you what had happened, at least as far as you knew, during the war, with him, and what had -- <span class="page-break" number="107"></span> Interview with Danguole Gabis m December 10, 2015</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You know, he never asked me. I mean, I told him as much as he wanted to know, and as much as I thought I should -- should talk. I-I was living by myself in Chicago. My sister moved to Chicago also. I had some Lithuanian friends. I was going to -- to a university there, and I was, for a while, very friendly with an Arab.

It's such a confusion, and it's such an unsettled time. In my case, my mother was gone, my very religious aunt was raising me, which I wasn't so enthralled about.

And we had these [indecipherable] cards, and we could buy food in the restaurant there, but they -- all they served you, there was just watery soup basically, that's it. And so my brother and I, we take our marks, and would march out into the villages outside, and we learned -- we wanted to buy bread. We would say brot kaufen. Brot kaufen. It was late fall, and I remembered the ground would be covered with beautiful pears that just dropped off the trees. And the farmers will come out and bring big half loafs of this beautiful bread, and sometimes even -- even some smoked meat. And we could take as many pears as we wanted, and we would want to pay with our stupid marks, and they all said, no, no. They wouldn't take any money from us. But that was something that I learned, being in Germany.</p></p></dialogue>

There are hundreds of s -- of stories like mine. I don't know how it all ended up for them, but I think most of us ended up somewhere in the west. And did good -- had good lives. And for myself, when I think, I had a very good life. I mean, I had some hardships, and so on. When you are young, things are easy.

But then again, there is a seven year difference. But now and then we can speak about the time in Germany, and how it was. Or how it was when we first came here, to United States. That was an interesting thing, too. I mean, came here and no language. Gloria.</p></p></dialogue>
