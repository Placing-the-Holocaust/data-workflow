So when Hitler, Adolf Hitler came to power I'm sure you've heard of him, all the fun was gone and the teachers, there was a professor particularly. He always came to visit my parents and he was so nice to me. Well, in order to exist in his position, these people had to abide with Hitler's ruling and to make believe that they were friendly to Hitler. So the relationship didn't any longer last the way it should have.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Let's stay a little bit in the time up to Hitler first, up to 1933. How would you describe yourself at that time. Were you an independent child or very attached to your parents?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well my sister was far more independent than I. she was three and a half years older. She liked the boys and I was more or less clinging to my mother's skirts. But --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did you have any interests? Were you interested in sports or music or reading?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Music, particularly and also we got a grand piano and we took piano lessons.

I said yeah for me too yeah. And to this day I am the saddest person in the world there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You can still do it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well. I am just a little bit older than the average student you know, yeah. You know I'm an old lady. The other day someone said Marianne how old are you? I said 61. Then I took two steps and I turned around and said no, no, no. Not 61, 91. There's some little bit of difference between the two.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Ok let's move ahead now to 1933. What is your first memory of Hitler or do you know when you first heard about him?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [heard that he was speaking in a big park and I went like a good little girl to the big park and this guy was making a speech. He was not making a speech. He was screaming like an idiot. He was screaming. And I lost my taste for him immediately. And then when I found out what he was going to do to us, to the Jewish people, it was good by Charlie. Ach.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What language did you speak at home?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. The German Jews don't speak Yiddish.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Then and as you said before the teacher in school once Hitler came into power, changed his relationship with you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: This professor who taught us German. I mean it was in Germany. The German language like here a professor teaches us English you know. So that's how he was teaching us German, even though he -- we lived in Germany and he was a German professor but there was no slang involved. My father would have not allowed slang anyway. He was a believer in the language as it's supposed to be you know. <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Marianne Roberts 10 April 11, 2012</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I think, and your father fought in World War I?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: In fact not only World War I, the Second World War he was shot in the lungs. In the First World War, thank you, Joanie. He was shot in the lungs and therefore he spent many a moon in Switzerland in a sanatorium you know. Yeah that --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: When Hitler first came into power and people realized what he was going to do, did your parents talk this over with you and your sister? Or just your sister?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My father died the day Hitler came into power. And I must tell you that things changed overnight. There was a projectionist. We had two projectionists in our movie. So they were upstairs on the roof in a, in a projection room. And the day Hitler came to power, whereas before my father was no longer here. So my mother always ran the movies and whatever and the businesses and so the younger projectionist came down. He sat down in our kitchen. And he was so fresh to my mother for the first time because the Hitler gave him the power to do this to this Jewish woman you see. You were dirt if you were Jewish you know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did your father die suddenly or had he been ill?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. He had been ill. He, due to the First World War, he contacted tuberculosis from being shot in the lungs. Yeah so he was sick for a long time and we always came to visit him in Switzerland in the high up.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Until the first thing was he threw all the Jewish kids out of school. So my sister and I were without schools.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So do you remember what your feelings were? What is it like to a child to be thrown out of school?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I mean to say we felt like, in a sense like dirt and certainly felt no love for Hitler because --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You said you were the only Jewish children in the school.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In, yes. That's true yeah but there may have been other schools where they also had Jewish children.</p></p></dialogue>

There was a little boy who was somehow able to get food to us and then we stayed for a while with Russian Jewish people because my sister kind of was engaged to the son. And -- Joanie: Tell the story of going to eat cake in the little cafe and you had to leave your table because you were Jewish and other people needed to sit down.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't remember that.</p></p></dialogue>

This man did have a good deal of money so I hear.</p><p>And they took the parents away and left the little kiddies, three of them, maybe starting three years old, let them just sit there. So then my sister and I ran upstairs and we took the children.</p><p>And then the regular police in town came and took them and I don't know whatever happened to them. Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Believe me, it ain't funny, believe me.

And so we were down there without food, without drink for several days until we wound up going to Lottie's fiance's home, the Russian Jews.</p><p>And yeah so we were down in the basement for several days, nothing to eat, nothing to drink and never knowing when they might discover us.

It took three years anyhow. It was not an easy feat so my mother -- they didn't want the Jews to leave Germany. Because they wanted to have all our belongings you see. And so my mother said girls, my sister and me, we're going to tell them that we are going on a cruise to what was then Palestine which is now Israel. And we're going to tell them we're just going on a cruise to visit this exhibit you know. And sure enough the day we wanted to leave the Nazis came, that they're big shots you know. We're here, Frankone [ph -- German?]. We're here. You're going to -- want to leave us. My mother said oh no we're just going to see this exhibit there in Palestine. They went like this.

And she wrote to them to start the process of getting visas.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: So what would I do without you for God's sakes.</p><p>Joanie: And this is in 1935 she started this process.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Because when I come back to all of this, I'm like a bundle of nerves. That's why my brain isn't working yet. But that's what happened.</p><p>Joanie: So somehow when you were in hiding in 1938 you heard that the visas were granted.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes, I don't know how. Gave us the news.</p><p>Joanie: And that's when you and Lottie had the chutzpah to leave this hiding and get on a train to go to the consulate.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: We went in the middle of the night. We then to get the train and then I, when we went to the train to get our visas, my cousin who lived in Holland somehow he had been told so he was waiting in the compartment.

I said Oscar can I now talk and say anything I want and there was another man in the compartment who said can you imagine the teachers, thank you. Oh. Excuse me. He said can you imagine what she just asked me, whether she now can talk and say everything she wants you know. So we came to Holland but unfortunately the same thing had happened to Holland eventually. They took him and his wife to the camp yeah.</p></p></dialogue>

And so one day I found myself across this man, sitting across the table and in perfect English, the king's English, I told him what happened and que pasa, you know that I wanted to continue on and she wanted to stay.

So he saw evidently that we were good material. So he called in the head of Picker x ray, the head and the result was that this head of Picker x ray came several times to give us lessons how to take x rays. Cause the equipment was there.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did what you had gone through and the difficult times from 33 to 39, which were very difficult and frightening, did that influence you in how you raised your children, do you think?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>Did it make a difference?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh no. my children were raised the way I wanted to raise them. It, are you asking me whether I asked my children to hate Germany?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No, no, no. I didn't mean that. I just meant, no not at all. I just meant in the way that you raised them. Were you strict with them? Did you try to get them to be independent because you knew later in life you had to be very independent.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You had been through a very difficult time.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, she always, Joanie always says to me, mom you can do anything.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right, right and you became very independent as you said.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: They never had to thank God, to go through what I went through so there was no need for comparison.</p><p>Joanie: But you did not speak about Germany at all until we were grown up. <span class="page-break" number="30"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Marianne Roberts 34 April 11, 2012</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was not aware of that.

No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you ever active in the civil rights movement? Here you lived in a country that deprived you of your civil rights.</p></p></dialogue>

In the 1960s, 1970s, the height of the civil rights movement.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My civil rights movement is the fact that for years and years and hopefully much longer, anywhere and every place I get up and I speak about the Holocaust. Anywhere and everywhere.</p><p>This is my, this is my gift.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Where do you speak?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: In schools, in colleges, in universities. Any club that wants to hear.

Which I didn't know here. So -- Joanie: Just this spring, 2012, you have spoken in front of 900 eighth graders who were studying the Holocaust.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And many more besides that yeah.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What lessons do you want to impart to the children? To the students?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Not to honor Hitler.</p><p>Joanie: But as you say in your speeches, this must never happen again.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So there's your answer actually. It must never happen again because I've had my share and, and other children shouldn't have to go through this.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you think it could happen again?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well it depends who is in government. How, how fair people are who are in present government. I would not want it to happen to a dog, really. I don't believe. I cannot say I don't believe it will never happen again because I don't know who is in charge.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Because?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Because of the relationship and the memories it brings, good and bad. This is my field, the Holocaust Museum. I am very happy. And don't think for one moment I appreciate so much what you are doing. But I can tell you it ain't easy. It isn't really. And but it's something that needs to be done. It needs to be talked about that this should never ever happen again. And the more people hear about it, the more important it is.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: To speak about the Holocaust.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh yes. I mean --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: How did it first start? Did someone come to you to ask you?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The rabbi, the rabbi asked on the day of the Holocaust that six people of his members in temple, would come up and light six candles, light, each one light a candle.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: This is in North Carolina?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: This was, was this in North Carolina?</p><p>Joanie: That was in Florida.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: In Florida, so yeah Florida. What would I do without you? So anyway, then he said to me so then I lit the candle. And he said to me, Marianne, I would like to ask you how about speaking about it. And this is what got me started. I very soon after I found myself before 1000 temple members. He was a very young modern rabbi. And I found myself before 1000 temple members and standing up there and I was looking around and I said to myself, how come you don't feel anything? It's because of my youth. My parents owned movie houses. We were always in the limelight. And I always had to shake hands and say good day and make a curtsey. You know when I was a child. So this is why to this day, nothing bothers me. Nothing bothers me. I'm a lucky duck really to say nothing bothers me.</p><p>And so the rabbi had asked me to -- there were a thousand people in our congregation which was a reform congregation and I spoke and I had, he had -- <span class="page-break" number="33"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Marianne Roberts 37 April 11, 2012</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Applause?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Applause yeah and from that, the next step was the high school in back of the temple, again they brought all the different classes in. A thousand students and from that day on, that was it yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Up to that point, would you tell people what, up to 20 years ago before that, would you tell people what you had gone through? Did people ask you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well of course, because I spoke with a foreign accent.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you were willing to say what had happened?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well I don't remember, but I'm sure that I must have said, maybe I didn't talk about it too much, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When you meet people from, Jews from Germany or other countries in Europe, do you feel a special connection to them?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I tell you the truth, I have not as yet met any Jewish people that came from the same environment. They, some Polish people, yes. But the Polish people suffered a great deal but not from Germany.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you stayed in New York for how long?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>Joanie: From 1939 until 1980.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And that's when you went to Florida?</p></p></dialogue>

I'm a lucky duck to be living in the United States, that's all I have to say. And my mother always wanted to and unfortunately you know she couldn't come with us but --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: How did she know so much about the United States and what do you attribute that to?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The Jewish people were all talking about the haven, the United States. And which other country would take in Jewish people. It was a mixture, a melange of different things. That, the United States was the, the -- and that in the United States people could live and have freedom.</p><p>That's what we didn't have in Germany, you know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When you meet a German today, what are your thoughts, a non-Jewish German?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: A non-Jewish German? Well of course I can very easily say I have no love for any one of them, because I remember some very sad things in Germany. When I was a little girl and I was maybe in third grade, and there was one girl, Gentile J, a Gentile girl who was very beautiful and I admired her so for her beauty. And we went home with the same trolley car. So she sat near the window and I sat on the inside. And I always admired this girl for her beauty. And so this was the first time we had a real good conversation. And then I was the first one to get off the trolley car because I, that was home. And as I got up and walked away, there were two seats between her and me. She looked at me after all the nice conversation we had and she said you dirty Jew. So I said to myself, how could you love people like that really. You dirty Jew she said. And then I remember in front of our movies, there used to be other kids my age. And really a little bit older perhaps and they would put their fists into my chest and say you killed Jesus Christ. So I personally did this you know.</p></p></dialogue>

So I looked and they said, the Jewish left ear is different from Gentile left ears. So I knew that this was such garbage like I never heard in my life you know. But I didn't dare oppose them. So this is the picture they took of me here. With the left ear exposed. I look like I was 16 years old here. I look like I was 90. Look how dejected I am. Yeah, disgusted.</p></p></dialogue>
