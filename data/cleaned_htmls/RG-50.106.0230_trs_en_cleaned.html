Pesach Seder, grandfather had one Seder with the younger children and my oldest uncle had, in his part of the house, or his outside of the house, did his Seder. He had a large family also. So the idea was to steal the afikoman. And I got greedy. I wanted to have them both. And they knew that I was out hunting the afikoman so they prepared two pieces of cardboard wrapped in a towel and I started, when I came around starting to hunt, they knew what it was all about and everybody was making believe they weren't looking at me. Secretly looking for me and I finally found what I was looking for and I stuck it on, skedaddled only to find that they were two pieces of cardboard. So everybody had a good laugh except me. I felt cheated but I had to laugh along anyway.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you know from what you were told or any memories. Was it an unpleasant time by the time you moved in 38?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was scared of groups of Polish kids. So this translated of course, since I didn't see any other kids. This was translated into being scared of groups of kids. To the point where even when I was, even after the war, when I was 12, 13, when there was a large group of kids coming, after school for example. I would always cross to the other side of the road.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was mostly, most of my associations were within the family.

We were on the road to go to down where my grandparents lived for example. Part of the route we were not in the convoy because we were on horse, a horse drawn carriage. There was no automobile traffic essentially. It stopped. I think the army requisitioned all private cars. There was no -- it was horse and buggy.</p><p>Not a horse and buggy but horse and wagon.

That stopped fairly early during the war. I mean he was basically told that's it. If you no longer, no longer have this business. Grandmother still had her store, fabric. That lasted til about 40, 1940 I would say when any fabrics. Jews could not trade fabrics any more so for a while they converted the store into glass items, things that Jews were allowed to deal with. Textiles were not.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was it a particular, besides the kids on the street. Was it a particularly frightening time for you as a child?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Frightening in the sense that the gorots [ph] were very nervous. Now also frightening when the Germans came in. We arrived in that town shortly after the war started.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So that's the fall of 39?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. Then when the Germans came in, all the treli [ph] essentially ran away from the town, abandoned everything and ran away but only about four or five kilometers and from four or five kilometers away we saw the town burning. And the uncertainty was is our house burning down or not? It didn't. The damage was only in another, very different part of the city. The Germans set it on fire and the part of the city that the Germans had set on fire burned down. Fairly severe.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I'm a little concerned. Which city are we talking about?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Skala.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It's 42.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: All right so. There were two events where the Germans tried to make the town Juden reind [ph]. The first one, most of the town was cleared out. I was sent, I think, we had very good connections with the Polish police force. There was one person on the Polish police force who was a personal, a school friend of one of the family members. So we were told that the Germans were coming in. So everybody who could tried to hide. Grandparents were, well grandfather was, they were over 70. Grandmother was about 70. Grandfather was 72. And same thing on my father's side, about the same age. So they were hiding in a barn not far from the house. I was sent away to farmers, a few kilometers away.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: By yourself?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was that a frightening experience?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Extremely. Extremely because I was separated from my parents for the first time, separated from everybody.

It was a Friday, it was a Friday, a Friday afternoon. I just couldn't take it anymore. So I asked one of the kids of the farmer who, with whom I was staying to take me back. And he took me back.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: He took you back to your parents?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. And on the way, there was a vivid memory on the way. With one of the people. It was harvest time. The beginning of harvest time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was this the fall?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: 42, yeah, September 23" I think. 42. It was harvest time and there was a young man harvesting grain and as we walked by he looked at me and he said you're so and so, aren't you?</p><p>And I said yes. Grandfather was very well known and he recognized me. And then he started saying your grandparents, your grandfather is dead, your grandmother is dead. So.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's how you heard?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And what about my parents? He said I don't know. I can't, I'm trying to put myself in the shoes of that guy. What was he thinking?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: To say that to a child? So then you get home, or you get back to your parents?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I get back to well in, where we were staying yes, because grandfather had lost the house at that time already because the Germans took it over and since it was the largest building in the town, the Germans had taken it over for their headquarters.

But a lot of relatives got killed that day.</p><p>Father survived, mother survived that day.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And then what happened?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I'm trying to think. So then that was a question of what do we do now? What do we do now?</p><p>Most of the Jewish population had been wiped out. Those who weren't killed immediately were transported away and only five or ten percent of the Jews of the town remained. Father remained basically. Father, father was alive only because he was transporting the dead bodies. Anyway, in the time after that we knew that we had to disappear. So a lot of time the men of the family, spent a lot of time trying to find hiding places. And they did. On the day of the second expulsion, the German word is Auslintung [ph]. I don't know how to translate that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Expulsion. Ok.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: But the first one was September 23". The second one was sometime in November. I don't remember the exact date. But we again we knew it was coming because of the personal friend in the police department. So --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Do you remember his name?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. Ohno.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So he told you and what did your father do?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He sent us away. Mother and me and a few other relatives. We had prepared hiding places.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Adi Eisenberg 21 August 29, 2014</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: To a farmer basically.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In the countryside?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. Father stayed in town because my uncle, his best friend, was married to my mother's sister so he said I can't go with you. I have to wait for him. He was out of town and was supposed to come back that evening. And did indeed come back there. But father sent us off. The best friend did indeed come back that evening. But by that time the town was already surrounded and he couldn't get out.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did he survive that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh he did not survive?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, that was the last time I saw him.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh my. How did your mother hear about this? Did she find out right away?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: She found out a few weeks later through the policeman friend. We let him know that we were in hiding, where we were. And he came by and told mother that he was taken away. With his best friend.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you know where they were taken? Or you don't know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No. From what my older cousin who is no longer alive told me they were taken to a small town nearby and shot. He heard that again from the policeman. My mother didn't tell me.</p><p>Mother knew but she didn't tell me until very much later. As far as, what she tried to maintain is the idea that we don't know where he is. We hope he"! be back. <span class="page-break" number="18"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Adi Eisenberg 22 August 29, 2014</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Tell me about the family that you were hiding with. Do you have any memories of them?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. There were several places that hiding places were prepared, but when push came to shove most of them didn't want us. So apparently the penalties for hiding Jews was severe. And most of them didn't want to take the chance which is again understandable. So of all the places that we had prepared, none of them worked out. So eventually we went to a place where other family members were hiding and we asked to join them basically and the farmer accepted us. As an added, well remember this was for money. The farmers were being paid very well. By then standard. As an aside, when the money ran out, we had to go.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You had to leave.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: This was not done out of idealism. I mean they were risking their lives. What they did was certainly appreciated but when the money ran out, we -- my aunt on the other hand was with a family where the money, when her money ran out they kept her and I spent a while with her.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: From 42 on til --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: All right, 42 on. September of 42 to about fall 43.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So that's a year.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Father was dead already. Mother was doing her best to manage in Krakow. We had papers as Christians.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh by then you had -- so what was your name? Did you have a new name?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Mokra, M-O-K-R-A</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And your first name? <span class="page-break" number="19"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Adi Eisenberg 23 August 29, 2014</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My Yiddish name, my Jewish name is Abraham and so the Polish version was Adam so my Polish name at that time was Adam Mokra.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you were now in Krakow?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: After the hiding period, I joined -- after the -- When we could no longer hide at that place, mother sent one of her friends from Krakow to get me. And --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You moved to Krakow --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: For only a few days.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh a few days and then what?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: There was a fairly well established, by well established, I mean not generally known but among the few Jews who survived, one of the ways of getting, survived to that point, one of the ways of getting out of Poland was through Czechoslovakia. So mother had arranged and again I don't know how she arranged it, but she was a miracle worker.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: She sounds like it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: She had arranged to essentially go to Czechoslovakia. So of course, you couldn't get a passport and go to Czechoslovakia. The idea was the papers that we did have as Christians, essentially made it possible for us to go to Zakopane. Zakopane was a --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Resort, wasn't it?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. Ok. But it was close to Czechoslovakia. So we went to Zakopane, by train. Not with her. She was already there but a friend of mother's picked me up at the farmer's place and took me to Zakopane. This is another farm. There were two farmers and families where we hid. And <span class="page-break" number="20"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Adi Eisenberg 24 August 29, 2014 took me to Zakopane and the next evening. No, that evening, that evening we started walking to Czechoslovakia.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The two of you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no with a group. A small group. About five or six people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You're seven years old?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah this was September of 42 or don't remember. November of 42. Ok. October of 42, that sort of thing, so I was seven and a half. Basically crossed the border into Slovak, well what is now Slovakia, not Czechoslovakia. Liptosky Santa Nicholas [ph]. Again I don't know how mother arranged it but the group was met by a car. And transported to a collection house where other refugees like us were being accommodated. Slovakia was much less under German occupation than Poland. They came in later on, much more tightly, but at that time you couldn't function as Jews, but the pressure was much lower. So we were taken to that place and stayed there for a few days. That was sort of like heaven. Cause when I was in hiding, for example, in Poland. I don't know whether I mentioned it before but the last few months, 42, no almost a year when part of the time, after I joined my aunt in hiding, after November 42, part of the time we were in an attic. That was for a little while and then after that essentially in a barn but buried under straw. So they had to keep the straw to feed the animals, take care of the animals, farm animals. And the farmer had arranged a hiding place under the straw. So this was completely dark. Flashlights only for eating. For sudden. I didn't have any, I had shoes. The kind of shoes that I came in with and I came in as a seven year old. At that time I was eight. So one year, between seven and eight your feet grow. The shoes didn't. You know my toes were curled up like that and it took a few months to get them straightened out. So where were we at this point.</p><p>Slovakia.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: This is 43 we're talking about. <span class="page-break" number="21"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Adi Eisenberg 25 August 29, 2014</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: This was 43. So we stayed there for a short period. Days, rather than weeks, I would say.</p><p>Then transport was arranged to the Hungarian border. And a guide took us from the closest railroad station. No, not railroad station. Because we went by car, this was car. On the Czechoslovak side to Hungary. Again walking. Scary moments in trying to cross the border.</p><p>And you know worried about where is the border patrol and all that. Anyway, when we crossed into Hungary I think the guide had an arrangement with the Hungarian border patrol, so first he collected the money from us. And then he reported us to the Hungarian border police and they standing there waiting with a rifle behind the rocks so as we walked by they all of a sudden stepped out. I remember the sound of the bolt being pulled back.</p><p>There were six or seven, eight of us on the --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Were you the only child?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah. Yeah. At that point there, not many children had survived to that point. The children were the first to be killed off. So we were taken to a jail, a civilian jail, you know border crossing. And I remember it was a Saturday. And as we were walking through the town, we saw Jews coming back from dovening there. They --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Do you remember what town in Hungary it was? You don't know. That's ok. Did you talk to them?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. No. cause we were Christians.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh right I forgot, you're Christian. Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: But the Jews recognized us as Jews. So we ended up in the town jail for crossing the border illegally. But remember Hungary was not under German control yet. So what I remember about that Saturday is that the Jewish population of the town started sending us food into the jail. And we ended up with about 20 or 30, there weren't many of us. I said the group was only about six or seven people, eight people. We ended up with about 20 or 30 pots of cholent. For the first time since the bad times during the war started, the first time since 1941, I stuffed myself. <span class="page-break" number="22"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Adi Eisenberg 26 August 29, 2014</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Up to that point, had your health been ok?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. The usually kiddie stuff.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: No, but it was a stressful time. I was just wondering if --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah, no, no.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You had your cholent.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right. Did I have cholent. Very different cholent from the Polish cholent. Cause they used beans. The Polish cholent does not use beans. Or at least not our type of Polish.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you ever hear any of Hitler's speeches on the radio, cause you understood German you said.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Now you're in Hungary and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah so we had been transported from the border basically to a larger town in. From the larger town, eventually to Budapest.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: To Budapest?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And we were being transported to Budapest on a passenger train, not the cattle cars or anything like that but regular passenger train. Mother was sitting. It was a passenger train so we were being guarded by the Hungarian police, but we were not in chains or anything. So we were just being transported from one jail to another jail but the jail in the capital. <span class="page-break" number="23"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Adi Eisenberg 27 August 29, 2014</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I see. They were taking you to another jail.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah in the capital in Budapest. From this --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: How old was your mother at this time? Do you know what year she was born?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: She was 27 years older than I am so at the time I was eight years old, she was 34. That sort of thing. Now the idea was to get -- one of the people in the group that we were with when we had crossed the border had a relative in Budapest. Now how do we get information to them that we're around, help. So one of the people had a sheet of paper and a pencil on him. So mother asked him to write down the name of the person and the address. And on the back she wrote in German, we are here, giving the names of the people in the group. Help. You know with the name of the relative of the one person in the group, Huhum. So what do you do with it? She made believe she had a headache and sort of leaned down on the, in the railroad carriage. It was third class carriage. Stuffed the note into the shoe of the man who was sitting next to her, hoping for the best. And --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: This was a stranger?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, complete stranger. The guy sort of looked at her and she gave him a sign, don't say anything because the guards were sitting in the aisle behind them. One of the guards, anyway.</p><p>And so they brought us to the Hungarian civilian, this was a civilian jail. Basically mother had, in the letter mother sent see if you can arrange for us to be accepted as political refugees. We had all, we all had papers as Christians at that point. But the Polish paper. And after about three or four weeks in jail, it worked. So now we were Polish refugees in Hungary.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was it like for an eight year old to be in jail? You stayed with your mother?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah. The men and women were separated obviously but eight year old kid. I was allowed to stay with my mother. <span class="page-break" number="24"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Adi Eisenberg 28 August 29, 2014</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Any memories of that time?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yeah. Distinct memories.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Such as?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Mother's nightgown was stolen. And she, all we had was one small suitcase and mother carried a, and you couldn't have changes of underpants, underwear or anything so you had to wash everything. So when she washed her nightgown at one point. One of the fellow gypsy, fellow prisoners, a gypsy lady stole it. The reason that we know that she stole it, cause mother recognized it on her. So mother reported it and they asked her to take it off and mother said forget it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Then you get out of jail and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The relative of one of our fellow pass, one of our fellow, one of the people in the group, arranged a, with their relative to have us recognized as political refugees and we were taken away, were released from prison. And what do we do? So there was a restaurant in Budapest.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>And I don't know how mother found out about it where there was a gathering place, essentially for people like us. Refugees. And there you could arrange all sorts of things. And we were accepted as political refugees, sent to a small village in Hungary. And they couldn't keep everybody in Budapest. Everybody wanted to stay in Budapest but they couldn't keep everybody there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Which village, do you know?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Erich Cherta [ph]. Near Kolorcha [ph]. Kolorcha is sort of almost in the center of Hungary. And this was a small village. The train goes straight south from Budapest to I think the branch station was Kishkarev [ph]. The names are meaningless. And from there you take <span class="page-break" number="25"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Adi Eisenberg 29 August 29, 2014 another train to Kolorcha and on the way to Kolorcha, there was this little village where we ended up. And this was --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: With a family?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well we were on our own. We rented a room.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you're still Christian?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh yeah absolutely. Church, going to church every --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You went to church?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Absolutely. Absolutely. On one occasion a Polish priest, because a lot of Poles were in Hungary at the time. Not a lot but -- in our village for example there were, our village. I mean the village where we stayed. There were maybe 15, 20 other people, 20 to 30, Polish. Real Polish.</p><p>So there was a Polish priest who came to visit. Keeping track of the faithful.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did he question you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He didn't question us. I mean he wanted me to be altar boy. So I think he, I ended up escaping from that. He used one of the Hungarian altar boy.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did he realize --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: He performed mass in Polish and we were there.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did he realize that you all were Jewish?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I don't think so. I mean he may have but he didn't let on. Ok, he didn't let on. He came to visit. We spent a very nice hour or two with him. Nice guy. But he didn't let on. If he knew, he <span class="page-break" number="26"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Adi Eisenberg 30 August 29, 2014 didn't let on. We were not prospective parishioners but we were fellow expatriates type of thing.</p><p>And --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So you stayed in that village for a long time?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: "m trying to think. It was five months, six months. And it was a matter of months.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Months, ok. And then?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Then we were told that all the Polish people were being shipped off and we didn't know what that meant. So it was a question again of going back to Budapest and disappearing. Now disappearing was pulling off a disappearing act like that was not trivial. Because if you wanted to rent a, you didn't rent an apartment. You rented a bed. I remember the Hungarian the ad, the advertisements. Bed for rent which meant that you literally rented a bad in somebody's apartment. Odge Kiando [ph], Hungarian phrase for bed for rent.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Is that what your mother did? She rented a bed.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Sure you have to say something and try to make contact with the Jewish organization and there was, I mentioned there was a restaurant. And again I don't know how mother found out about it. And she could do miracles. Anyway she found out about it. We went there and she made contact. And at that point, the Joint kicked in. Because it was, she started being able to get money. There was no money. She had one five dollar bill from before the war which she kept through the worst of all possible times. She kept it in the heel of her shoe. But that was basically the only thing we had. So at that point money started coming in. Enough to, for us to be able to rent an apartment and to live on. And living essentially meant having a loaf of bread for breakfast type of thing. And because there were no cooking privileges. When you rent a bed, there are no cooking privileges. So for lunch we would have to go to restaurants. And it was kind of fun. Hungarian was primitive. Mother's Hungarian was very primitive. My Hungarian was primitive. I had learned. You know kids learn. Kids learn quickly. So one interesting episode from that period in regard to food. You can't eat the same thing all the time. So we were trying <span class="page-break" number="27"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Adi Eisenberg 31 August 29, 2014 new dishes every so often. So on one occasion, lecho. Let's try lecho. After you try everything else and we were basically ordering. Every so often we would order two plates but occasionally we would order one plate. There was just not enough money to, so we order the lecho.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What is lecho?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: A dish for which you need a fire extinguisher. I think it's rice based or corn based. I'm not sure. I don't remember the prime ingredient. Actually it's very good. After the war at it was excellent but at that time, on that one occasion, just couldn't eat it. But you know the Hungarian restaurants at that time, the restaurants in Budapest were perfectly satisfactory. So the important thing was to find one that was cheap and often. And the one that was cheap enough to find items on the menu that were cheap enough. So the money would last.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you see Jews being taken away at all?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Isaw Jews in Hungary in 1942, yes. In 1942.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: 44 we're talking about, 43, 44.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: 40 yes sorry. 42 we were in hiding. And at that time, Jews in Hungary were still alright. But not for long. Cause June 44, Horthy Miklos resigned. And Germans essentially took over the country.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You were there? So did you see Jews being rounded up?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, before that we saw quite a few Jews. And every time mother had the opportunity, Jews with beards. I mean the Jewish there were -- and every time mother had the chance to talk to one of them, she said get away from here. Hide. When the Germans come in, they'll make your life miserable. And the answer was invariably not here. I never realized that --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But you all weren't in a sense worried because you were Polish Christians still in Hungary? <span class="page-break" number="28"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Adi Eisenberg 32 August 29, 2014</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well the level of worry.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Imean you were worried of course, but I mean you still had papers that you were Polish Christians.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, refugees yes. We were accepted as refugees by the Hungarian government. As political refugees. There is only one problem. I was circumcised. So the danger lay in somebody saying I suspect you're Jewish. Drop your pants. You know so that the game is up. Because the Christians at that time, invariably were not circumcised. It's not like the United States now. So that was the dangerous part. But as long as that didn't happen, we were fine.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you stayed in that situation until the end of the war? Until liberation?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Until January of 45. When the Russians came in.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You were in Budapest?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. Well part of the time we lived in the village, some from Budapest, Erich Cherta, I think I mentioned that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Your mom had gone to the, back to the restaurant you said and tried to make arrangements.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>And then --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no, no. The arrangements were just a few hours. But we stayed in the village for a few months.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The name of the village, do you remember the name of the village?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Erich Cherta, on the way between Kishkarev and Kolorcha. It was side spur. <span class="page-break" number="29"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Adi Eisenberg 33 August 29, 2014</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You did say that.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It's a north, south line.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And that's where you were at liberation?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, we were liberated in Budapest because at that time what was happening basically is that for some reason, the stay in the village got iffy. It wasn't, we didn't feel right. There were searches. They suspected that some of the people were Jews. So the simplest thing to do was to disappear.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Go back to Budapest.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And disappear meant basically go back to Budapest.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Which you did.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And live as Polish refugees in Budapest. But you have to register with the police, give an address and people were not allowed to rent you even a bed more than one night if you hadn't registered with the police. And you had to have proof that you registered with the police by filling out a form and getting a little piece of the form torn off with a police stamp. So there were two levels of hiding. One was if you lived for example at 37 Kiriutsa. You put down 7 Kiriutsa.</p><p>Reported to the police, got it stamped and then added the three. So present it to the landlord, perfectly legitimate but the police still didn't know exactly where you were. And on one occasion that saved us because the city was big but the neighborhoods were small. So we were walking into our apartment. Somebody came up to us and said the police was looking for you, but they were looking for you at --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Down the street. <span class="page-break" number="30"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Adi Eisenberg 34 August 29, 2014</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Down the street. Why were they looking for you down the street? No idea. So we skedaddled back to, packed a small suitcase and disappeared immediately.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell me about liberation.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Ah. The last few days before liberation were -- ah, well we were very happy at the time. But it wasn't that for the population as a whole. It wasn't a very happy time because even when we were in the village. The village was just south of, about a hundred kilometers or so, south of Budapest. And throughout a good chunk of 1944 I could see the bombers. You know this was, this lasted for what seemed like hours. The overflight lasted for what seemed like hours. And they were coming I think from air bases in North Africa or Italy. I'm not sure where. And just dropping major loads on Budapest.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you go into shelters?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well not in the village. In the village I still didn't encounter them. Then when we went back to Budapest, it was essentially a question of spending a good chunk of every night in the air raid shelter. You know as far as we were concerned, they could bomb the hell out of the city as long as they didn't hit our building and towards the end --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So you're an old man of nine years old at that point.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. Towards the end the bombing got very dense. I mean I was right, I was on the ground floor of the building, a five story building and a 50 kilo bomb hit the top floor. Right above me.</p><p>So the bomb penetrated the roof and one floor, but it was only a 50 kilo bomb so the roof, the ceiling of the, and the floor of that apartment was enough to slow it down. It wasn't a high explosive so. But it was scary. I mean the ceiling started to shedding dust.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember anything your mother said to you specifically going through those traumatic times? Sounds like a very strong, incredible woman. <span class="page-break" number="31"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Adi Eisenberg 35 August 29, 2014</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yeah. My hero.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You obviously came through it so she --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I don't remember any specific words. I'd have to think about that.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did you know it was the time of liberation?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Russian soldiers, well we were in the basement of the building. But basically all of life moved down to the basement. For food basically we had ten pounds of beans. And mother cooked beans in water. That was our food three times a day. Twice a day. We didn't eat three times a day. She managed to get the beans by essentially walking into the back of a store, grocery store and the owner of the store took pity on us and basically sold us, I can give you some beans. Ok, we'll buy beans and that kept us going for, towards the end of the, until liberation.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What, let's talk about liberation now. Any specific memories?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah the liberation essentially the first sign of liberation was a lot of shooting. The fighting.</p><p>And then when that quieted down a squad of Romanian soldiers walked up. And they stayed overnight and then moved on. But the Romanian soldiers, and I'm not sure whether the Romanian soldiers were a German rear guard. Or the Russian advance troops. That I don't remember any more. I think they were part of the Russian advance. And then we started seeing Russian soldiers. With a red star and you know the Russian cap. Flap up and then the, very good they were excellent design. I have one like that. Not enough, not from that period but --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did you know what liberation meant at nine years old?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh absolutely, absolutely. It meant no more Germans.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Any celebration or -- <span class="page-break" number="32"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Adi Eisenberg 36 August 29, 2014</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, there wasn't very much to celebrate. Just celebrate, just being happy to have survived.</p><p>Major worry about what happened to the rest of the family. Major worry about is father alive?</p><p>Father didn't go into hiding with us because he was with his friend.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What did you do right after liberation?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Tried to make contact with other --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Relatives?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Jews, other refugees. We were in contact with some but you know staying in Budapest was no long term solution.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What did your mom decide to do?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The general idea was that Bucharest was in much better shape. That had been liberated months earlier and apparently the life was much more stable so.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you went to Bucharest.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. Yes. There were transports being organized for Polish refugees, essentially going back to Poland, by way of Bucharest. And we basically stayed in Bucharest.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You did not go back to Poland?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Eventually yes. But after, after a few months in Bucharest.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you stayed in Bucharest a few months, and then you went back to Poland?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And then back to Poland. <span class="page-break" number="33"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Adi Eisenberg 37 August 29, 2014</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Back to Skala?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Nothing. As a matter of fact we were advised strongly against going back to Skala because a lot of Jews who were coming back were killed by the Poles.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What reception did you all have?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We didn't because we basically went back. We saw there were no Jews and we skedaddled.</p><p>So it was just a short visit.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: A short visit. And did you go back to Bucharest. After that did you --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, not after Poland, no. After Poland we went to Germany.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: To Germany. And where were you in Germany?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: A small town first in east Germany and east Germany was under communists so that was not a happy long term solution so we went to West Germany, to Munich first. And then Bad Reichenhall which was a small town near Berchtesgaden. A summer resort, a summer and winter resort, not far from Berchtesgaden. And then Bad Reichenhall we stayed til 1951.</p></p></dialogue>

And I was pretty much caught up with -- because of my private tutor. He was a fantastic tutor. He had been assistant, well private docent. I don't know what that, that would be essentially somewhere between instructor and assistant professor at the University of Breslau. He was at loose ends so and he was tutoring a friend of mine. There were only two or three kids my age at Bad Reichenhall in the town, not in the DP camp, but in the town. Eventually we moved out of the camp into the town. So he was a tutor for one of my friends. I basically asked him whether he would be interested in tutoring me also. He said yes, so he and father made arrangements as to how much and all that. I wasn't involved in that. But he started tutoring me.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You better believe it, you'd better believe it. I stayed on the deck for hours. Just staring at the Statue of Liberty and we sailed right by the Statue of Liberty. The ship docked somewhere on 30" Street, in the 30s. At that point, of course the Statue of Liberty was no longer visible. But was visible at dusk. And that was an unbelievable sight.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no we got to Worcester, the Jewish agency was very helpful at that point. Somebody from the Jewish agency met us, took us to a cheap hotel, very cheap hotel. Three dollars a night type of thing.

Did the other American kids ask you about your childhood, ask you about your background?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Occasionally but not --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: What about the high school teachers. Were they sensitive to what you had gone through do you think?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Probably but again I didn't notice any special treatment.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah so basically I hit the books. I needed to prove myself.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Why did you need to prove yourself after what you had been through?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well because you know as a refugee kid, you sort of realize that things aren't going to be handed to you on a silver platter. So parents made it very clear that it was essential for me to go to a university and in order to get accepted to the university you had to have good grades.

Not a finishing presser, but a, I was doing the inseam. They hired me at I think 55 cents, no not 55. 75 cents an hour. You know once they saw that I could do things my salary went up to one fifteen an hour and that was unheard of wealth. So at four hours a day I was making five, almost five dollars.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was it like to go back to Europe?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Nice. I could speak the language. I knew, it wasn't a problem. I didn't quite understand initially. I didn't understand what they were saying to me because it was Switzer Deutsche. It wasn't my kind of German.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you continue to talk to your parents and in what language? <span class="page-break" number="43"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p></p></dialogue>

Mostly German but occasionally we would switch. Depending on what we were talking about so it was essentially a bilingual existence. And after a while they got to be very good in English.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. Eliot.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Eliot is your son. Ok. Can we now talk about some of your thoughts and your perspectives and feelings about what you went through? Do you think you would have turned out to be a different kind of person if you hadn't gone through the trauma that you did?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I thought about that every so often. I don't know. I don't know. I like to play scenarios in my mind but it's --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: What if.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: What if is not an exact science.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Are there any sounds or sights or even smells today that trigger memories of the war to you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: German uniforms.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What does that do to you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: It makes me hate. I realize, rationally I realize perfectly well that the Germans today are very different group of people from the Germans that I --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Cause I wanted to ask you what your thoughts about Germany and Germans are today?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Ah. Rationally I think a lot better of the Germans today than of the Poles today because the Poles were -- you know very mixed feelings about Poland also because it was Polish people who <span class="page-break" number="45"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Adi Eisenberg 49 August 29, 2014 saved my life but by the same token it was Polish people who were responsible for the death of most of my family. Polish part of the family. So and you know right now in going back, anti- semitism never existed in Poland, according to the Polish version. The Germans acknowledge what happened and made moves to get over it. But Poland never acknowledged the anti- Semitism and anti-Semitism was vicious. And I remember numerable times getting beaten up.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You were physically beaten up, not just verbally.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you ever really harmed?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No. it wasn't, yeah --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Bruised.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Horse manure was thrown at me. You know stuff like that. And the frequency with which I was called Poshavezhedia. Scabby Jew. And this, it was, you could see that it was gut level anti-Semitism. And when we were living as Christians, part of the time that we were living as Christians, going to church and all that, the sermons, insofar as they dealt with Jews were not viciously anti-Semitic but they were intellectually anti-Semitic. Not every one of them, obviously. Not every priest. But I have no love for the Catholic church.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Have you been back to Poland as an adult?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Because.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Scientific meetings. <span class="page-break" number="46"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Adi Eisenberg 50 August 29, 2014</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Scientific meetings. And what were your emotional responses when you got into the country?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Very negative initially, very negative initially and then after a day or two. Anti-Semitism in Poland probably is not much worse than anti-Semitism in many other places. It probably is but it is worse than the other places that I visit but maybe it's because I understand the language and I know them better. You know and we lived in Germany after the war. I had German friends, good German friends. I kept in touch with them for many years.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Even after you came here?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. With Germany I find it easier to, I find it much easier to deal with Germans than with Poles. Not because the people I'm likely to meet were responsible for anything dealing with the Holocaust. It's just the instinctive feeling is very negative.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you think, and again you were a young child, do you think your experience affected you spiritually as a Jew or religiously?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Religiously.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It's hard to say cause you were young.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Religiously, I like to think of myself as an orthodox atheist. I feel most comfortable in terms of synagogue attendance I am most comfortable in an orthodox environment, to the point even orthodox or even Chasidic environment. Intellectually I'm an atheist.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did you raise your son? Did you give him a religious background?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In Montreal?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. First a non-religious one and then later on a more religious one.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So he had a Jewish background?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, very much so.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What were your thoughts, do you remember, during the Eichmann trial? Did you follow it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I wish we could put the whole country in it. No, you know there were obviously a lot of very good Germans. Even if they kept quiet. I mean again keeping quiet is not shameful. I don't know what I would have done, that's all I, I don't want to say anything about the people who kept quiet and disappeared into the background. But I have no love lost for Germany. I try to avoid going back to Germany. Not because the present day Germans are responsible for anything that happened then, but because of what it evokes, cause of what it evokes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What are your thoughts about Israel?</p></p></dialogue>

I go Israel almost every, I'd say average every two years. Going back there in September of this year again. Very positive, very strong. We lived in Israel for a year at the Weismann house. I was on sabbatical at the Weismann Institute. Not quite a year.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was it an advantage do you think being so young in the beginning of your wartime experience than if you had been older?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [hesitate to think of it as an advantage in any way shape or manner.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was it better to have been young, that you experienced this?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: If [had my choice would I rather have been older? Is that the --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah, that's one way of looking at it. Or was it better that you were younger and not aware of what your parents were aware of. Obviously your parents were aware.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I was aware fairly early. In 1942 I started seeing the first bodies, when I was seven years old. My grandparents were murdered when I was in 1940, when I was seven years old.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What does that do to a child?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: It taught me to hate the Germans. And it took a major effort of will to realize that not every German was a Nazi. Right now I've come to terms with it, but and then you know we lived in Germany for a while. The late 40s so. Living essentially in the enemy camp was a major problem initially. Starting to go to a German school initially was a major problem, but as time went by, I made friends among the German kids in class and I was in touch with at least one of them for quite a few years. <span class="page-break" number="49"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Adi Eisenberg 53 August 29, 2014</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You said that. Are you more comfortable around other people who are survivors as opposed to people who are not?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think it matters right now.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you feel a connection?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah, but not the kind of connection that makes conversation easier. There is a bond but, and you know. Let me put it this way. When I go to a meeting and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You're talking about a professional meeting?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. And one of the speakers is Jewish, do I necessarily go to his talk in preference to somebody who is non Jewish. Not really. I mean the kind of feeling, well yeah it's nice that a Jew made it, is doing such nice work. But that's about it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You don't feel a gut connection?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not while ""m doing science, no. It's, I mean it's basically it's nice that a Jew is doing such nice work.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: As you've gotten older do you think more about your childhood experiences?</p></p></dialogue>

Is it in a book form or just --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well I bound it, hand written notes. I made a copy. I then bound both.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You were such a vulnerable age when --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Inever get that feeling. It was very personal. That's why I can't bring myself to feel comfortable in Germany. In spite of having lived there for five years.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Have you been to the Holocaust Museum in Washington?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you have any thoughts about it or is it appropriate that it is in Washington when the war took place in Europe?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It's appropriate to have holocaust museums wherever they spring up. And you know even now, what good would it do to have a holocaust museum in every small town in Germany? The German kids are no different from the French kids and the Spanish kids. Can't hold them responsible for anything. It's important for them to know and as far as I know, I have very good German friends, professional friends. And they tell me that the youngsters get taught about the Holocaust. And in considerable detail. He even said sometimes they say, they tell me it's too much. But I don't say anything in a situation like that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: During the civil rights movement in the 60s and the 70s here in the United States, do you feel that you were more attuned to it because you had lived in a country which deprived you of your civil rights? Did you have an extra sensitive --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: More, sympathies very much so. In terms of the sympathies. In terms of action, I can't say that I was very active.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You were still young. <span class="page-break" number="52"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p></p></dialogue>

But I didn't go to Selma or anything like that. I was too worried about getting tenure.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Here you had been deprived of your civil rights growing up.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, so the sympathies were, for the civil -- but not to the point where I joined the ACLU.</p><p>Paid my dues for a number of years. But it wasn't a major part of my life.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: [haven't thought about it. Let me think about that.

She's living in the States and that's the best of all possible --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: That's a message.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yeah, people here don't appreciate what they have. At least, a lot of people do but a lot of people don't. A lot of people take it for granted and by the United States, I mean general democratic countries.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you think the world has learned anything from the lessons, any lessons from the Holocaust? <span class="page-break" number="53"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Adi Eisenberg 57 August 29, 2014</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Depends who. Germans have. The rest of the world, probably not. What they have learned is if you're going to kill out a group of people, do it quietly. Don't leave traces. You see a lot of this in Asia for example. I don't think it's a situation that can't happen again but I think it's a situation that we have to be careful, careful in the sense of watch out for. I think it can happen again. It's very tempting if you don't like someone to kill them. And especially if you can get ahold of their goodies. Right now, more of it's going on in Asia than anywhere else or in Africa.</p><p>But there are islands of hatred in Europe that are still burning bright. Thinking of Yugoslavia for example. So from that point of view, some Europeans have learned a lot from World War Two.</p><p>A lot have learned less. And amnesia is beginning to settle in. There's not much we can do about it. If they don't want to learn. So I think the only way to protect oneself against that sort of thing is to do exactly what Israel is doing. To provide stockpiles of atomic weapons. Hopefully never to use them but then your enemies know that you have them.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Adi Eisenberg 58 August 29, 2014</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, because it wasn't practical.

Well more than a few minutes, but not -- it wasn't overwhelming. I mean this was not the most important part of my life.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You felt very American? Do you feel American?</p></p></dialogue>
