<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: From Warsaw.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Warsaw. Th -- I don't know whether it was the beginning of the war, or that was a little bit later, and anyway they, for some reason they went to Moscow. And m-my mother's what -- what she was doing, what she -- what she was, a -- an medical person, and they allowed her to live in  <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> </p><p> Moscow, because at that time, under the Tsar, Jews were not a-allowed to live in Moscow, unless they were engineers, technicians and medical people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh. And what was your mother at the time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: She was fercherka, which is a -- a -- more than registered nurse. I think they have now this kind of people who work with the physicians, surgeons and so on, and they're very close to -- they didn't graduate as -- as doctors, but they had --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: They had a lot of training.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I know that in Warsaw he had the store, a haberdashery store.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I'm not sure.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What are your earliest -- I know you were only there for a few years, but do you have memories from being in Moscow as a child?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, one memory which I am -- I am not so sure it's a really memory, because I was four or maybe five years old, that I was running through a corridor in the apartment, and knocking at that -- one of the doors, wanted to get in and crying, and somebody picked me up. And I -- later on I told my mother and she said, well you described this corridor, though I -- it was true, was long corridor, but I don't remember the rest.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's all, you know. It's the very early childhood, if I really remember that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right, right. Do you remember the chaos of Moscow at the time of the revolution?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I don't think I -- I re-remember that, but later on I -- I m -- read and heard --  <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- that it was a very dangerous street. You shouldn't walk around. There is a very good book ab-about what was going on in Moscow at that time, by Jeromski, who was a writer, and -- and he wrote about the son and -- and -- and father who met ge -- ac -- accidentally that they were working together in a -- some kind of labor, slave labor or whatever. It wasn't slave labor because they were free to go. And she -- this guy who had gi-given him a place to live, told them, don't wander too much around Moscow, it's a very dangerous place. And it was. It was shooting innocent people [indecipherable] somebody brought out to uncover their name, and -- and they were just shooting around the city, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, I understand that your father left Moscow to -- to try to get to Odessa.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you re -- do -- did you remember his leaving?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, not at all.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I don't.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And what were you told -- I understand later that you were told that he was -- he went to Odessa for --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: He was trying to get to Odessa, I don't know how, what and how, because trains were not riding th -- you know, there was no schedules or anything, just a train comes in the station and you get in and you ask where -- where is it going. It -- it was a complete chaos and he was trying to get to Odessa, but my mother's brother said that -- that they never seen him.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh. And so do you think that he left in 1918 or 1917, do you have any idea?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think it probably -- se -- eight -- si -- 17 or 18.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: 1 -- [have no idea, I can't say that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And then how long did you stay in Moscow after he had left, do you --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I think my mother decided to go back to Warsaw and she was looking for a way no -- down there. She probably found out about echelon. It used to be called echelon, this train. This was set up by -- I don't know, it ma -- it must be later than "18, because when Poland regained their status as -- as a -- as a country, they decided to help the Polish people to come back. And if you - - if you fi -- if you ever were a citizen of Poland, you could apply and look for a -- for a s -- town where it will stop. So probably my mother did that, find out where -- where it is. But before that, we went to Krasnodar, which is a town close to Caucasian mountains, where my grandparents on ma -- my mother's side lived. And we went there and stayed, I d -- don't know how long.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was that nice for you to be there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think it was nice, yes, it was v-very nice house with the verandas [indecipherable] and -- and there was a huge tree where our neighbor made for children to climb in, and there was a little house there, but they didn't let me go. I don't know, maybe once I was there, but was -- it was a joyful time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And my grandfather passed at the time and we started our way back --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: To Warsaw.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- to Warsaw.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And your sister was born when?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: She was born in Warsaw in 1910.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So before your parents left for --  <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> </p></p></dialogue>

And you were six years younger --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Right, yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- right, so it's a big -- it's a --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, this is later years, yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: So --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So you went to Warsaw.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes, we went to Warsaw by echelon, a train which stopped at Rostov. Rostov on -- on Don, which is dona in Polish, whatever. I keep forget -- Dniep -- no. I keep forgetting --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- the name of it in th -- in English.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What is it in Polish?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The Dnieper.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The Dnieper, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Right. And we had to cross the -- the sea from Odessa to Rostov, and the only thing I remember, I was sick on th --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- on this -- on the trip, yeah, that's all I remember [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And what are you, about five or six at this point?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I probably was six or seven, yeah.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And when we came to Poland I -- I didn't speak Polish yet, and I remember later -- later [indecipherable] in -- in school that was a poli -- teacher of Polish, and he reminded me all the time that I am -- that I am putting the -- the sentences in a way Russians put it. And -- and so it was kind of a long way. So we cou -- we came to Warsaw in "22, I think. "22 [indecipherable], and I went to school, and the school was co-educational, which was a big, big st-step forward.</p></p></dialogue>

That what I am saying, that I myself never felt anti-Semitism, but it used to be -- used to be for awhile in late 30's that the national party came to -- to power, and students in the university demanded a diff -- different places for -- for Jews to sit. But I -- I don't think it ever came th-through this. There were a lot of fights between s-students in the -- at the university, mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But before we get to the university years, tell me a little bit about growing up with a single mother, obviously, which I don't know that wasn't so typical at the time.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And when was that? That was later?</p></p></dialogue>

You know how it is with -- later on I went to another school, and after that I went still to another school, Polish schools. And the last one I went was in different part of Warsaw, and it was kind of funny because the school was on a -- a high building, that was high probably at that time, it was nine floors or something like that, and the school was on eight and nine floor. And we had a different entrance because the tenants who lived in -- in the -- demanded that that will ha -- but sometimes we got out and come down the stairs of the tenants and rang the -- the -- yeah, what is it?</p></p></dialogue>

Or you have contact with the outside, meaning the Polish, which I had, and -- and could sell something to friends and they will give you any money. But that was all in the beginning, in the beginning of the ghetto.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. And do you remember these self-help organizations, house committees around Warsaw?</p></p></dialogue>

And some had contact with  <span class="page-break" number="27"></span> </p><p> the Gestapo. They thought this will help them to -- to get out of the deportation. But a-at the last time, it did not.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Mm. So as -- let's talk between 1940, in November, when -- when the ghetto -- when the ghetto really becomes enclosed, until before the deportations, what do you begin to think about the Judenrat at this time?

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, it di -- you know, they -- they just couldn't do much. They were told one day they have to -- to send 10,000 Jewish men for work. And where would they find those 10,00 Jews?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And it would -- was a -- a very bad job, I should say.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, they -- they couldn't come out of it right. And once they were arrested, all of them, and there was a saying all over the ghetto that something bad is coming, and they were -- and they let them out in a couple of days. So we didn't know much about it, what was going on. We knew the [indecipherable] commando, which was in later years used to get people out of the houses, and march them to Umschlagplatz.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mmn-hm.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="28"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Maybe they had easier to get food, but I don't think they were ever paid or -- or anything.

In the first day of the uprising, the Germans pulled out, it was such a strong --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- but of course later on it's -- it's [indecipherable] it was tragic.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="29"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. But did you -- be-before the deportations, did you know that there were political groups talking about what they should do, or what they were capable of doing?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, well, not much, not much. That it -- it was chaotic at first, you know?</p></p></dialogue>

It was too dangerous at that time. But he saw me, and he approached me, and we went for coffee and he told me about his -- his marching 0 -- 0 -- the -- you know, because there were orders and six or seven September from radio, that all able men to carry weapons should go out toward the east.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When you got the special pass.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Right. And I don't remember, I just went there and was told that I -- I can work there. And they were sewing the camouflage outside, the camouflage an-and the white part was underneath so they could, you know, in snow -- in snow, it doesn't show. And I didn't know how to sew on that, you know, sewing machine. So I was -- hadn't finished some of the thing. And th-the hours were terrible, because it was -- I don't remember, from eight to -- to one or two o-or from four to -- to 12 o'clock at night. And we were fall asleep, of course, all of us. And we got food there, and they brought it in large kettle with soup, which wasn't soup [indecipherable]. There was some -- some food at the very end, so it was lucky, you know, to get the --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You mean at the bottom of the pot.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: At the bottom of the p -- yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I see. So did you try to wait the [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, some did, of course, yes. But -- and there was bread, I think to the na -- probably now it's a very -- very much looked after, this kind of bread which was dark -- black and you had all - - all seven grains, or eight grains, whatever.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="34"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And -- and th -- I worked there, but th-the first time which I got into this big walk, you know, through the Warsaw to deportation that -- I wasn't at Tebbins, I was at home, whatever I want -- went to look for some -- something, I don't remember what. And I was swept out with this large crowd which was filling in both sidewalks and the middle of the road, they were just going people with children, with -- with bundles of -- of -- of food -- not food, I don't know what, and that -- and we were going toward Meeska, toward the Umschlagplatz and the gates were closed when the took out the people from the -- from the houses, they closed the gates. You know, that's kind of gates what you come at 11 o'clock that used to be, and you had to wake up the -- the guy who takes care of the -- an-and give him 20 cents or whatever because you came late. So they were -- they were closed tight --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You mean, outside -- the outside gates --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- outside, right, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- of the house, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because the houses were -- they had that -- the gate was open over there, and you come in and walk to the right or to the left or further down where it's called Pardvuka, which was a larger part [indecipherable] something like that, where the housekeepers were -- were cleaning the rugs from upstairs. A-And -- but one of -- if wi -- I recognized one of the policemen that I knew him, and he recognized me, and he showed me on the way to Umschlagplatz that one of the gates is a little bit open, not completely shut, and I followed that. Came out of the crowd and I thought well, I've nothing to lose, and sneak in the -- the -- the gate. And there was a lot of people there, and we waited for a couple of hours until everything calmed down, and the people who were hiding in -- in the apartments, they came out and they told us how to go to -- to different streets.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="35"></span> </p><p> But the streets, you know, they -- the houses were cut like alleys so you can go through one street to another without coming out on the main street.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And so I went home and they couldn't believe that I -- I am still there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So they were frightened because they saw all these people and they knew you were in the street.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh they -- they knew nobody -- nobody came out of it, and so they were very happy about it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What did -- what did you know about these deportations at this time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, we know a lot, but we thought, you know, Judenrat helping to that. That this is all some lies. Those are young boys who just fled, you know, the [indecipherable] and -- and th-that's not true, it's -- but we started to believe that is something wrong at the end of the line. But a lot of people did believe.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So in -- in "42, when the deportations begin, you've heard stuff about Treblinka?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Even before that.</p></p></dialogue>

That was the -- the end. There was no -- nobody, you know, nobody a-as far as I know nobody escaped from Treblinka.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: [indecipherable]</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="36"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't know, do you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Well, there was an escape later. There [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah, maybe yeah. Because some were left to | -- sort out the -- whatever th-the others left.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right, right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah. But --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So what did you be -- do you remember what you believed? After -- at the attack on Russia, there's a lot of killing that goes on.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right? That the Germans are killing. Do you hear about those killings as the Germans are attacking Russia in 41?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yeah, we knew about it, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You do? And what did --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Cause we -- we had this bulletin from [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Who -- who brought in the -- the bulletins.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And we knew what was go-going on in the world, and it's -- it was getting, you know, better, and -- but who knew when it will end? We -- we t -- we thought at first, you know, when we lived outside the ghetto, that this will last half a year, a year --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- but not five.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="37"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, w-we -- we just didn't -- I -- we didn't have time to think about it, you know? I-It -- it was struggling every day. Every day you need food, you need -- your mother is not well. It -- it wasn't the -- the only -- when we got this news, it was far away, and nobody cares. Nobody cared. There was a time which I later found out, that Americans and English knew everything what is going on. So -- not only through Karski, there were many other people who -- who came and -- and w-were telling what was going on, not only with Jews, but with Poles. And nobody could believe that they're taking those people and just putting them under gas. At -- at first they were just r -- large vans, which we've heard about it. No -- nobody believed it. It was -- it was impossible to believe. So everybody thought, you know, where are we going? But later on, it started to dawn on us that this is the end, and everybody who could -- there was building of hide- a-way kind of things. You have a stove and you -- behind the stove there is a room there, and the -- So i-- you put the stove at -- at the -- at the entrance, and there was nobody there. So these people survived. How they survived, it was terrible, because I was in one of those ones, and I was told that there were small children with us, and the parents knew if we hear somebody coming [indecipherable] or SS, or what -- whatever, that we ca -- we just have to smother the child. Yes. And since then, when I went to one of those because I was not at home, I was going out, and there was an alarm that Ukrainians are coming, and I didn't go an -- any more to these hiding places, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: To this -- uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But there was a lot of these hiding places, and I think until they -- they -- the up -- uprising in ghetto, that a lot of people were safe this way. Oh, I -- of course, I -- I don't know. A lot of people outside the ghettos w-were saved to the --  <span class="page-break" number="38"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- until the Polish uprising.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Let me go back a little bit, to the work. How -- do you remember about how many people were working in that shop?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I don't remember exactly, but in my room there were probably 40.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: 14?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: 40.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: 40.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: 40.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But th-there were other rooms, you know, where they were working. Actually, they -- I must say on behalf of Tebbins that he was giving those ausweiss rather knowingly, that those people don't know how to sew.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh. Including you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Including me, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So nobody trained you on the machines?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, I -- no, I started to -- to use the machine when I was out of there, yeah. So that was --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Was there -- were there Germans -- German officials in the shop?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, no --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: No.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- nobody, nobody. When the -- that -- that was kind of a relief, that was nobody there except the supervisors. One was called Jan -- Jahn -- Jan -- H -- J-a-h-n. And when I was liberated already outside in Quakenbrick where we li -- used to live for awhile at the -- with the Polish  <span class="page-break" number="39"></span> </p><p> press, I saw a man on the street and I thought it was Jahn, and I told Stefan, he said, oh, you have ideas. I saw him another time, and I was so sure that it was Jahn, but Stefan said no, that's probably not. I gave up. You give up on -- on the lot of things. When we were at the -- under the bureau [indecipherable] under the British and we occupied as part of Germany, we got the print shop for our -- our newspaper. And the -- the owner of the print shop was coming to those journalists, and telling them, I never was a Nazi, I never -- never had anything to do with them, and [indecipherable] a-anything, he would say. And they were listening just, you know. Nothing -- nothing happened to any of those people, and he was a Nazi, there is no -- but there were a lot of them who had to join the -- the -- the party, because of their living. He had very nice print shop and -- and he wanted to keep it, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Wer -- were you able -- did you get something other than soup so that you -- some food that you were able to bring back to your mother and your sister and brother-in-law, or not?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: N-No, no.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You couldn't. And of course there was no pay, there was no -- it -- the only thing you got was food.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, that that I seen. I didn't.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How long did you work there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's -- you know, it's difficult for me to say, I -- I -- 1 do-don't know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Months? Years?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I -- until -- right -- well, maybe a few months. Until the moment when the -- the second Umschlagplatz happened to me, and then I stopped working, and the only food it was -- which was smuggled and w-we bought, and it was pretty bad.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="40"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So the first time you escaped deportation, you were just -- you-you're just sort of swept along on the street. You never get to the Umschlagplatz.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I didn't.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. So that was probably July, do you think, "42?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was July deg42.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: The first -- the first wave of --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- the deportations.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: 20 - something, 25".</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right, right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was a -- a crowd which is difficult to explain. We were walking one by one, and the children didn't cry. It was quiet.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. Nobody tried to escape. We were paralyzed. I-It was a unbelievable scene, just those dogs marching, an-and there weren't too many Gestapo people, they called -- those are special forces -- were special forces I heard, at home. And at -- that what you struck by the absolutely paralyzed people walking. It's -- it's unbelievable, I -- it -- it -- the -- the way I -- I -- I looked at this Jewish policeman, I thought I know him, and he kind of made it -- eye contact to me, and I thought he showed me with his eyes the -- the next gate, which was how -- and that was it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So how do you explain the fact that you were not paralyzed?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I don't know. Some people were not, you know. Some people made their way probably in other gates. I -- I have no idea.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I guess it's surprising that you would say it was so quiet. I would have expected --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="41"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was quiet.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah. Maybe a -- a whimper of a -- the child or something li --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But not much.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- but no, no, no. The same was the second time when I was at Umschlagplatz.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So now --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Nobody said anything.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really. So how -- how did it happen that you were at the Umschlagplatz the second time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>Would that have been in July again, or wa -- August [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, no, it was -- no, it was later, it was September probably --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: September?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- yeah. And I was walking, y-you know, to get some money or food, I don't know what. I went to Paviar Street, and all of a sudden I see a rush of people, but not as big, not as large as the previous one, the July one. And I was caught in it, and I walked with them. A young woman walked with me and we exchanged some words, but not much. And we went to a barrack which was -- I don't know what it was before, you know, because it's -- was kind of remod with table and -- and chairs. And the chairs were made of steel, you know, the kind of -- something like what we use now when a lot of people come. And we found a place and we sit down and waited for the train.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you're at the Umschlagplatz you think?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Pardon?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You're at the Umschlagplatz?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you're waiting.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And outside there was no -- no Germans inside, or maybe they were at the doors, but outside the -- were Ukrainians with dogs. And that was it, it was kind of quiet, nobody talked unless whispered to somebody. And I noticed that some people are going around and behind me, going to something which is open, and stairs are leading. And I talked to my companion, I said, I think there is something there. And she said, yes I know. How do you know? Somebody probably escape, but she said Ukrainians come later and shoot the people who are hiding. So there is no way. I said, well let's try. And she tells -- she said no, I don't want to because I still hope that ll find my family. I didn't say it -- anything. And she took money out of her -- you know, the -- the -- there used to be [indecipherable] which is -- they were different kind of -- there were no tights, but they were draw -- you know, yo-you draw from your corset and tie your --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- your -- yeah --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Your -- your stockings.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And she -- she -- I said, I am going. And she took out money out of, you know, her stocking, and gave it to me. I turned around and you know that -- these iron chairs were noisy, so I tried not to make noise. I got up and sl-slinked down, and went dis -- up the stairs.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So did you go on the floor? So you didn't stand up?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: 1-- Lalmost didn't stand up. I was just crouching, li-like this, and I walk.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="43"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: When I went the stairs, they were dark and when I came up, it -- it was a -- a door to some kind of a attic or -- or I don't know what it was, and wa -- there were some furniture, sa -- some things were lying down, but it was completely dark. And I went there and I -- I just sit down on the floor. And it was quiet, very quiet. I think I -- my heart was, of course, pounding. It stopped pounding after maybe I don't know, half an hour or so. And I probably fell asleep, because what I heard the next, it was [indecipherable] of these chairs and steps and later on schnell, schnell, the Ukrainians with the dogs, and it -- it took quite awhile. And I felt that people are around me, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But you didn't see anybody?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I didn't see, because it was dark.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't know, they -- it was a stockroom, so some kind of a -- a -- and then I heard the train and the doors closing down. And we waited. I think we all fell asleep probably. Kind of a early morning, we heard voices. One vo-voice, or two maybe, and they said, just stay where you are, don't move. And we -- we thought what is -- but in Polish, not [indecipherable] and we thought, wa -- what is it? And came there, either they were dressed like medical people or they -- they put it on, I -- I have no idea. And they let us out and took us to the hospital. Gave us some tea and something, and show us the way to ghetto.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So the room that you were in w -- led into the hospital that was right next door?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh, no, it wasn't very next door, but there wa -- probably was close. They had the -- some kind of part in. Maybe they made the -- some kind of opening in the --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: In the wall?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In the -- no, it wasn't the wall. I-It was -- th-the long fence, whatever.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="44"></span> </p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah, well, it was different, yes, it was different, but th -- they suffered a lot, too, and all of a sudden, you know, comes a German outfit and rounds up several blocks and takes out people from trams and take them to -- to Germany to work, or just shoot them for no reason. And some who were taking part in underground were taken out and you know, they -- they were shooting them or taking them to a concentration camp. So they suffered, yeah --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And -- but what --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- a lot.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- di -- Limagine --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I mean, in regular circumstances, Poles suffered a lot.

<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="57"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So it was -- it was quite a decision to take Jews in, especially men.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, they were circumcised.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Oh, oh, taking in Jewish men, uh-huh, I see what you mean, yes, right. So they could be easily found out. So do you think more women were -- were saved in these circumstances than men --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I don't know.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- because it was less dangerous?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You know, for different reasons. But there is a -- was a much higher chance for them to stay alive.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I-It was a long one.
