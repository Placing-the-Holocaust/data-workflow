<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- that it was a very dangerous street. You shouldn't walk around.

And if you - - if you fi -- if you ever were a citizen of Poland, you could apply and look for a -- for a s -- town where it will stop. So probably my mother did that, find out where -- where it is.
