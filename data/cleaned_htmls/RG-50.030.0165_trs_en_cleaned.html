<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My mother was a housewife. She worked a little bit in wineries. She used to pick grapes and when she did, she used to take me and my sister and my older brother and we'd go and work along side and with the money that we got...they also fed us there during the day because you couldn't stay, work without eating...in evening we came home and slept and in the morning at five o'clock we used to get up and go back to work. And we'd work like this maybe for a whole week. On Sunday we'd return home and from Monday to Saturday, we stayed at the winery.</p><p>We'd come just to sleep at home. My father also. Sometimes he would also sing at a wedding, at a ceremony. We had a pig, a few chickens near the house and that's how we lived. We worked a little bit to find some money for clothing, for food, to buy whatever we couldn't grow near the house. My father was taken to the army.</p></p></dialogue>

They broke windows.</p><p>They really created a stir. Some had children. We also had children, but we were quiet, hoping that they'd let us go. So other people whom they had just taken but started creating a ruckus, they sent them home. Now I'm sorry too. How come we didn't make some noise too? Maybe we could have gotten away from being sent away. So they came. They took us to the school. My mother was coming, crying, to let us go. They didn't. My mother showed all the papers about my father being in the army and they said well, maybe they'll be freed later on. My mother went to the police. Every where she showed the papers...nothing. So we were taken away. We stayed at the school maybe about two days and then they took us to Socora (ph). They...in Socora they put us on a train. It was a long train. It had brought people from all over, not...many cities, not just us.</p><p>And took all of us who were there in that neighborhood who were on the lists, but not the others.</p><p>The others were returned from that school back to home.

Because everybody knew that if it were after...the guards were after us. There were soldiers along side us, so we saw that the old women, children...children say Mom, I can't carry you any more on my back. I'll throw you down. I can't carry you. You are heavy. The mother couldn't walk. Her feet ached. So once this woman just let her mother down from her back and left her there. The...but then she went back and picked up her mother whom she had left on the ground. Afterwards the girl still couldn't walk with her mother on her back. Left her behind and the woman just was left to die on the road. Women with children in her arms couldn't carry them anymore. They were starved.
