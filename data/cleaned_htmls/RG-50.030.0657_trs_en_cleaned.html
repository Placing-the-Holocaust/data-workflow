The kids, we talked that we saw that and that and so on. Now, that time when they ended, they announced that next Sunday the same. Now, not to extend th-the story, next Sunday was the same. The same people down. There is an- another probably 30. They caught another bunch of hidden people. And the ones who were already dirty, with -- with -- w-with the -- with the wounds, with everything, and I saw how the German, with -- with -- with sword, cut one, the ear was hanging here, I saw that. You imagine, how could I live not -- not putting this to history? Was hanging. I don't know if th -- he survived or not, but that time when they ran around. Now the people came and you could detect which one was torture already, which came with the nice suit, nice shirt and everything. And after a half an hour, they all looked the same.

Anyway, and the same procedure.</p><p>Reviving was dragged into the pond and back, revived and beaten, beaten, beaten until they couldn't walk or so.

Is irrelevant now, that -- that -- that -- but some told me that even was just a few people, the fourth Sunday. I -- I don't know. I mention in my writing that -- that somebody claims, but I-- I don't --I don't want. No -- and -- and that was over, and all what I have seen.

No -- no one survived. No one. If they didn't die there at the place, the torture place, they died in the prison. They -- they were not fed, they were not -- not --no -- not care, nothing.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, here's another question. You say that -- you say that -- that they ruined the Sunday, you know, the -- the Sunday walk. But was that the reason why people didn't talk, or -- or was it that they were horrified?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Horrified. I-- I would assume. The -- now I'm just speculating, I'm guessing.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: They were -- they were stunned that why they should do that?

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You know, I was disappointed. I was disappointed with you a little bit, you know, that you don't call. Because I said why?
