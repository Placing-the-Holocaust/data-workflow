<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: OK. Norbert, where we left off, we were talking about Auschwitz and you had been describing its __--_--~.~"There were some stories about Auschwitz that you had wanted to share with me in particular.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah. I think in in connection with the with the daily question we were confronted with...how do we survive, because once a ___--_--_ asked me I should tell him something about the art of survival, and the answer is their is no art, so I will...in Auschwitz it was an accident, or a chance. Uh certainly you had to have the the will to survive and I must say after the first couple of weeks or months, where very often I was confronted with the question, will I be able to make it, or should I rather uh uh uh put an end to my life in order to be liberated from the misery, but then after one year or so when I got the better job and could work as a welder, and also was able to uh to uh get some additional food here and there for certain activities, for instance, when I was was uh appointed a bed-maker and and also when I was appointed to be the secretary of the block in order to keep the records, that gave me a chance uh then to to uh somehow keep myself cleaner and and uh also to...my my I would say was was strengthened by by by that... <span class="page-break" number="0"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, uh because I II helped out to a certain extent to uh to uh to uh...for instance, when there was...when food was distributed, you know, there was a certain order had to had to be established. I was able with my school French, for instance, to speak to the Greek prisoners, people from Greek who spoke only Greek and French. That was...or or or Latino (ph). Latino certainly I didn't know, but my French was good enough to communicate with them, or also with the people from other countries in order so that that uh ___I_ was trying to help and then obviously the secretary uh uh who was doing the work before left, so I was asked to do it and and I accepted it gladly because uh I didn't become an officer of the of the barrack, but at least it gave me a certain chance to to to improve, which was...improve, you know, and and and and uh whatever improve means, you know...conditions somehow. Uh so therefore as I say, the the the uh the chance to to survive, the chance that, call it that on the morning you didn't know if the evening would be yours or in the evening when you went to bed, not to be sure that the next morning you were still alive...somehow turned more into the positive angle. You wanted to survive. You wanted uh to to to survive and and reach a normal world again, at least that was my feeling to, as <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> uh were were loosing at the eastern front and every day was another step uh uh uh and one day hopefully the eastern front would would reach us, because we were in the eastern part of...located in the eastern part of Europe. Uh the...that was one of the things in which the British were so helpful, and also to provide food and and support directly uh and I was also the beneficiary of many of their good deeds and I'll never forget about it. One of the things which interesting was that one day a fellow who came...he was from India because his father was a sheriff in India in the British administration. He had never seen England and when we talked, I could tell him a little bit about my experience in London and so we exchanged views and so we became friends. And he told me then one day...and then as...since our life was such a peculiar kind of life, without papers, without books, without...with hungry for for for some spiritual food also. Uh he told me somehow that he has gotten something from I don't which...an organization in Boston, and I asked him, do you have contact with Boston. He said sure, through my military mail I have. He said I have an idea. Could you eventually try to establish contact for me with my friend...with friends I have in America, in the United States. The address I knew by heart...you know, we had no address book anymore, but my memory, thank God, was good enough. He said sure I will, so I formulated for him a letter in which he said I met Norbert here. He is alright. He is fine. He doesn't know anything. He doesn't know where his family is right now. I mean we had to be very careful and he hopes one day to be able to see you again, so this letter he sent out, and it reached my friends, probably after months or so and uh in the closing days of Auschwitz...I think it was already in December when when most of the industrial area was was badly, badly smashed and destroyed...he was...all of a sudden came running and he said I have good news for you. I said what was it, another uh big uh big uh victory on the on the western or eastern front. He said no, but believe it or not I got a letter back from your friends.</p><p>Now this was something which Auschwitz hadn't seen before, and I couldn't believe it so I was so This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> excited I I ran to the toilet house in in the area where we were working. Uh the man who was in charge of that was also an inmate and I said, listen, close all the doors and I give you...I don't know how much I have or not have...I have to read this letter. And I read from my friends who obviously did not quite understand what was going on. How could they? Uh said well, I'm glad to hear about Norbert. Just assure him when you see him again that we are the same friends we were, because we were friends from the youth movement, that when the war is over, he should come and be with us and and and and and uh uh he uh he should be of good..good courage and so on. So when I told this my very close friends, nobody could believe it, so I had the fortitude to bring this letter and to smuggle this letter with me into the camp, which was terribly dangerous certainly, but I wanted to show them also to give them some kind of courage. There is still...you see, can see even from Auschwitz, from behind the barbed wire, there is a connection you can establish with people in America, and uh then I came to this count...to America in "46 on a visit. Uh I saw my friends in Decateur (ph), Michigan. They had a farm there and uh uh I asked for that letter because I wanted to to make it part of my museum, and they said uh no, they will never give it away, because...but what they...at this time when they got the letter, they were completely puzzled. They said, for goodness sake how can he be...they didn't certainly know which location it was because it was a military number under which it was sent...how could it be he is a British prisoner of war. What happened to him, so they were completely flabbergasted until I explained it to him, to them and they they they got aware uh that actually that this was something in which a British prisoner of war became call it the conduit for a message to America, and I must say this gave me a tremendous lift up and and and and and uh I told some of my friends. Uh he could hardly believe it, but this is what you could do with the British because there was this solidarity of man. They understood you. And they didn't accept any kind of anti-Semitism or racism amongst them, because for them the Nazis This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> were not only enemies on a military uh basis but also certainly on a political and moral basis I would say. That was one of the things uh I certainly have never forgotten. There was also...I want to emphasize, there were other ways of spiritual resistance, to uh to uh nourish us spiritually. I think I talked about the service. But uh a typical example uh how how how spi...spiritual resistance can work is this example which I've cited very often. I met in Auschwitz uh very early at my arrival, an elderly man. He originated from somewhere in Galatia (ph), had served during World War I in the Austrian army, and uh after the war, after World War I, he had made his way to Berlin, had established some existence as a cobbler, had married, uh had a nice family, and with a so-called Polish ar...with a Polish accent, in September 1939 and he had been taken a prisoner and and and was shifted from Buchenwald to Saxonhausen, from Saxonhausen to Auschwitz, and so so he had, when I met him, already he had spent quite some years behind the barbed wire. He was a won...a simple man, uh a pious man, very religious in spite of everything, in spite of everything, and he said his his prayers every day and he always when when things were were difficult, he gave us certain quotations from whatever he had to to say well, uh they cannot succeed. Uh we were stronger in spirit than they. One day...it was uh uh in fall I think of "44...whenever it was, the weather was terrible. There was...it was a rainy day and the winds come blowing down from the <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> you doing. He said as you can see I'm praying. I said but I'm certain you said your morning prayers and for the (cough) evening prayers, I said it's too early, so uh what are you praying for. He said, well, I'm not praying not the morning prayers, not the afternoon, not the evening prayers. I'll sing a special prayer to God. I said what are your praying for. He said I'm thanking God, and I always was bewildered. I said __, thanking for what, for that misery we are in, for the for the terrible situation, for being forsaken here by God. He said you don't understand. I am thanking for God, God for one thing...that he didn't make me like them, the murderers around me. Uh and interesting enough, a couple of months later uh we had to undergo one of these infamous uh selections. That means when there were too many people especially in the uh in the in the hospital, uh then the</p><p> and the SS came to the conclusion that they should uh uh...that those who cannot or were <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> seen the only way to do it, and he was an an old uh camp man and he knew all the tricks and so he said yes, I I'm willing to undergo this risk, so that's what we did. We put him into the the mattress, covered him with straw and when the selection went on, somebody else went from for him and uh uh when they also checked the the the barracks, didn't find him in the in the in the mattress, so he luckily survived and he survived also the the end of the war and just two or three years ago he uh he uh died in New York at the blessed age of ninety-two. There's another interesting uh uh facet of this which uh has also uh described in his book, . Uh it was I think already I think in the <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> death sentence was usually confirmed by by ___, by the by the Gestapo, by the uh uh by Himmler's (ph) office in in Berlin, and then one day when we mar...came back from work, we saw the gallows uh uh erected at the square where we had our our our roll call, and we knew that uh that uh...we didn't know exactly what we saw...three gallows awaiting there, and then we got aware that these were these three friends who uh who uh obviously uh uh the order was...who who could not be saved and uh we all had to stand there at attention and the atmosphere was terribly tense because most of us knew them, appreciated them, loved them, knew about their courage and their dedication for fellow, for fellow inmates, so we were absolutely down and depressed, and then the spectacle began. They were led to the gallows and then one of the SS gangsters read the so-called death sentence, which was confirmed by Berlin that because of their attempt to flee they have been...the Reichsfuhrer (ph) Himmler has decided that they should be put to death, and when they were under the gallows and the ropes already around them, one of the three...by the way uh uh one of them is the brother of our friend Freddie who is very active in our affairs in in California. One of them all of a sudden penetrated this deadly silence with a voice which could be heard all over the the place and he said it in German. I will translate it ina moment. He said to...or he he cried out uh</p><p> , which means, comrades, keep your highs heads...keep your heads high. We <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> minutes, uh to tell us don't worry about us, but you will have the uh the the the chance to see hopefully the other world waiting beyond the the barbed wire. So uh uh you see, and this this is this is this is uh just amongst the many things we we know from that time, proof that uh phys...spiritual resistance had remained in spite of the fact, and I can say for myself also personally, to say that well, they tried to make us a number but they will never convert us into a number. So this this this was, as I say, it was already at a time when when when when uh the air, the political air was was so different. People still died uh daily. There was still enough victims unfortunately, but when it came uh to this time, uh uh uh there...it it...the whole, the whole atmosphere had changed when particularly when certainly was that you could feel slowly also the military effect of the advances of the of the advance of the Allies in the east and the west. In uh...I think it was in in August, early in August, we saw from from our places in the factory and the camp, we saw our first major attack by the American air force uh uh stationed at this time in Italy, coming from Italy. They had attained almost completely already supremacy in the air and they uh uh...I think it was early in August attacked arefineryin__I think is the name, and for days we saw the black smoke covering the whole area, so we we thought for ourselves, well one day they must come and and also try to hit this factory which did not produce yet but was very close to completion and sure enough, on on August 20th, 1944...it was a Sunday...the American air force uh to attack the uh uh combine...uh <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 0 (ph)...that is the price. Uh one bomb, interesting enough, also by mistake uh uh went down in our own camp, which is outside of the factory...which was outside of the factory. Didn't do any damage, but another bomb by mistake hit the British prisoners of war. They were sitting outside of some kind of a trench and uh uh forty of of those people were killed. They were playing gramophone (ph) music because they liked it so much to see the the the __ but then the bomb unfortunately hit, and amongst them was also a nice friend of mine, a man whom I befriended who who originated from London, but also the British said well, that's it. That's the price we have to pay.</p><p>Uh this is when we...when we went into action in Africa. We knew that that something like this could happen so that was it. What we...what what uh we thought after this, after this experience was why don't they come also to to uh hit the railways leading to Auschwitz. We didn't know at this time that, for instance, Jewish leaders were storming the chancellories in London and in Washington uh uh to do something like that and certainly we we didn't know that there was a letter then written...I think under the signature of the then Assistant Secretary of the Army John McL___, saying that uh uh the uh governments have to concentrate on the completion of the war and also they are afraid and this is the the wording, that if something would be done in the interest of the prisoners, the Nazis could become more vindi...vindictive towards the prisoners. Well uh uh...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did you feel when day by day went by and they did not bomb the railroad lines?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I couldn't understand that. I couldn't understand that. Uh as I say, this question came up more after the war when I asked the people what...we we...on the other hand, peculiar as it may sound, we were so glad to see them because we were...when the attack came, for instance,</p><p> , the only protection we had was outside in trenches where you could see these hundreds <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 1 and hundreds of fortresses, of flying fortresses, coming and and and and there was hardly any anti- craft fire from from the Germans. Certainly our people, many of our people were were crying and so and and praying, and my reaction was, I said be happy uh to see them because you might have relatives sitting in the cockpit, you know, and and doing this work in our interest, and certainly you had to reckon that you could be also amongst the targets, but this is...in war, you know, you you you unfortunately you don't know where it hits. Uh so after the first event in August, after that very effective attack, we were put to work immediately to try to uh undo the damage, because they wanted...they had a certain date... don't know which...to uh to uh uh not to start production but to uh to also to get into production somehow, and I think the day before the deadline, the the bombers came again with another attack and then uh the next uh day, the next target to to have the repair, the damage repaired was I think the day after Christmas, and sure enough on Christmas they came again, and they smashed the factory to smitherings and to such extent that nothing could be done anymore and there was...then the the morale I would say broke in this respect that they said there's nothing to be done anymore, so we were just trying to play around and play for time if possible.</p><p>Also uh then realizing especially in December that the Russian front had become very close. We knew that__ had been taken and that that certainly that they came pretty close, the Russian army close to Krackow, and uh then uh uh in the course of the military events, in January when the uh Russians started their offensive across the I think, and uh reached Krackow...Krackow was <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 2 What I had done in case they they should drive us out, I had put on my my British underwear and my British boots I had kept available in so in case we we were we were driven out, and sure enough...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Excuse me. I'm going to pause because I want to know where did you get British underwear and British boots?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: From my friends, from the British soldiers, you know. They had enough stuff and part of it...as I say I was one of their benefactors and they gave me what...not only certain things I hadn't seen for years like chocolate and once in a while cigarettes which I didn't smoke, but gave away, but they...when I told them that and we talked about...they had wonderful stuff, uh uh which they got from the International Red Cross, that certain underwear and also I had a pair of shoes I I could call it organize from them, and they were very generous and very gracious to me. I might owe the the British treasury something for that. I don't know, but uh anyhow that's what it what it was, and uh yes...on August 18th, uh somehow we heard that the the Russians had uh uh broken through the German lines, had uh entered Krackow. We saw on the on the road adjacent to our camp, we saw already all these trucks, the German military trucks and tanks and so passing by, but in the direction towards the west, so they were fleeing. And uh the question was will the Russians uh liberate us or what's going to happen, and then uh on August 18th, uh in the middle of the day, the order came that we had to be ready by four o'clock. We didn't know what...I1 mean we had no watches so it was...four o'clock was on their time. Everybody had to be ready to uh to walk out with the exception of those people in the in the uh uh hospital who couldn't walk, and we were certain that uh they would be killed there because they wouldn't let them fall into the hands of the Russian army,</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. <span class="page-break" number="11"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 3 of the Red army, and also we saw the day before by the way, that a lot obviously of papers uh uh had been burned, so the SS got already uh marching order with the with the with the order also to take care of papers which could be could be uh uh used against them, and then on the 18th in the afternoon we walked out and also the the the women of the of the brothel walked out and it was approximate...it was a a terrible wintry day, approximately we heard this...it was minus eighteen centigrades, which I think is less than zero fahrenheit. There were the icy streets on which we walked, and that was the first time that I saw again the outside there. The uh guards were very, very tense and afraid because they were they were deadly afraid that the Russians would overtake them and certainly uh being in an SS uniform was not...they knew it would not be very helpful for them.</p><p>We uh...whatever we had, I mean we had a little bit of bread and that was...a little bit of...I don't know...margarine. That's all we could...we had to...that was for the whole the whole time, we could carry, and uh we were...as I said we walked and marched, so called marching order and very soon on account of the weather and so people people dropped left and right, and if they did were shot at...on the spot. Some, interesting enough, especially of Polish people, non-Jews (cough) who knew that eventually or who hoped that the population around Auschwitz would help them, tried to escape into the woods, which during the night was was was daring but still most of them were successful because all all the shooting didn't help because most of the bullets hit the trees and not the people who had who had escaped, but for us there was there was no choice. We walked all night. We walked and and, interesting enough, we we saw, we heard the guns blazing. We saw the fire shine of the of the guns and any time we hoped that the front would come...would would be faster than we were but was hope against hope. Uh there was a bridge to be made over the __-- which was aa river near Auschwitz, and after the , after we after we had passed the , the SS guards <span class="page-break" number="12"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 4 and they couldn't make it to the other side anymore. The whole night we were walking and he who couldn't make it, that was the end. And we walked part of the other day and then reached a place uh in called Nicholai (ph) I remember where you had a a a brick factory and they drove us into that and wherever we could find a place to sleep or to stand and and we spent some time of rest and then we were driven out again in the direction towards Germany, and after another day or so and a night again, we reached a camp near the city of Leipzig (ph). Uh the people there in Leipzig had left already the camp and uh certainly also...by the way the SS (cough) certain travel because <span class="page-break" number="12"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 5 towards Czechoslovakia and uh across the border I think, and it was on an afternoon <span class="page-break" number="12"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 6 and uh they were they were concerned somehow, the Nazis, about the effect of that. So one place uh where we stopped uh uh the corpses were were taken down and then these SS gangsters Mull and Ruggers came and said well, uh since we have the corpses give us also the mussulmen now, which means mussulmen are the people who uh almost ready to die but were not dead yet. Uh uh I must say to the honor of my Jewish uh fellow inmates we refused that, but some of these uh uh German criminals said alright and uh there was nothing...we couldn't stop that, so what they did then was uh uh brought these mussulmen down and then both of them, Mull and Ruggers, took their pistols and shot them uh uh on the spot. Uh what happened later with Mull we don't know.</p><p>Probably he disappeared or was taken by the Russians and so Ruggers was discovered after the war uh and was tried in the in the courtin__--_--_ and I was one of the witnesses against him. Uh uh he uh pretended that he didn't shoot and he didn't...and the court was very tough and rigid with me to that I really knew that the people were still alive when they were shot and so on, but the whole the whole uh uh court procedure in my opinion, though it was a German court, wit Was a <span class="page-break" number="13"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 7 and nothing happened. Still standing there, trying to sleep and standing. There was hardly food or they they threw some bread into the wagons but but it was very difficult to grab it so...and I must say this was this was something which which uh was was then in history it's now called...it's a death march, which affected me very, very deeply and I know I had some kind of visions uh not so much to food but but to to be somehow to be under a roof, not to be exposed to to the snow and to the elements and to take a bath, a hot bath, and to sleep somewhere, but to sleep, sleep and and forget about everything else. Two days after having having waited in Mauthausen, we were told Mauthausen were filled. They cannot accept us, so they took the same train, brought us back uh through Czechoslovakia and took us to Germany and we crossed the border into Germany uh at place which I knew because uh I was hiking there. Also I had spent some some some vacationing there in the mountains. It's a beautiful spot called the Swiss they call... 5 <span class="page-break" number="13"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 8 yelled to me and said...his name was Bruno and he was...he came to Auschwitz almost at the same time I had been...Bruno had just uh uh uh perished this morning. He is dead, and interesting enough, his parents were still living in Berlin because his father was married to a non-Jewess and and she saved him in Berlin, but on the way from Dresden to Berlin he perished. Then we were taken to a to a to uh Saxonhausen to a placed called ___ and were asked to descend the...we could hardly walk down because we didn't move for days and days. We arrived there, I think it was on January 31st. We were on the train almost ten or seven days. As I told you uh when we left Leipzig, the roll call was approximately six thousand. When we came to uh Orianenburg, only two thousand had remained. All the others had perished...hunger, starvation, tried to escape, and so on.</p><p>And when we came to that place, interesting enough, that was not directly the main camp but it was like uh uh uh auxiliary camp which they had established within an airplane factory called</p><p> is a famous brand in in German aircraft building, but there was no no windows left <span class="page-break" number="14"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 9</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Where did you get a razor?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I still had it from the...also from the British.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was in Saxonhausen which was...which was approximately twenty to thirty kilometers north of Berlin. Now since...we we didn't know all the details but we knew that the American army had penetrated Germany uh uh deeply and that the Russians uh had had uh at least uh reached the uh the uh River, so the question again came up, what's going to happen and <span class="page-break" number="16"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 2 like cattle (ph) till the very last moment, and we uh we uh uh knew...we knew then that the Russians had had made...were marching towards towards Berlin and on April 20th...that's that's Hitler's birthday...we uh uh saw in Saxonhausen an air attack going towards Berlin uh uh of a dimension I have...I had not seen in Auschwitz and I didn't believe was possible. The air was...there were not only hundreds...there must have been thousands, and since it was a clear day, a beautiful day, the air there was filled with...it looked like sheet music in the air because of the of the the evaporating trails, and they went towards Berlin. How Berlin could survive under those circumstances, we were not quite clear, but they didn't___ Berlin. One bomb, interesting enough, also fell into our camp and luckily hit the munitions depot, so we when...then then we said to ourselves, those bullets exploding cannot do any harm to us anymore. When this was over...and it lasted a long time...and by the way, we had no shelter, no nothing, so we could see it but on the other hand it was interesting to to to to to watch it, but when this was over, after hours, there was no water. There was no electricity, but what for us was very important to know that no electricity in the in the in the barbed wire, so we thought and we had amongst ourselves days before spoken about some tentative committees we should build.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So we walked out and interesting enough, we saw already the German army in defeat.</p><p>They were...we walked in towards the woods surrounding Saxonhausen, we saw that uh army trucks and and and uh uh tanks and uh uh troop carriers had taken cover in these in these woods.</p><p>We saw women for the first time. We hadn't seen women for for weeks and weeks. And we saw, interesting enough, also German refugees who obviously were running away from from the front because what had happened was that the Russians...uh and we didn't know that they were supposed to take Berlin, that under the agreement they had with the Allies, the Allies and Americans were were to stop at the , not to advance, but that the Russians would surround would surround <span class="page-break" number="17"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 4 because the nights were still pretty cool...it was April after all...so we walked uh quite some stretches for a couple of days. We saw (cough)...excuse me...more and more refugees. We did not know what the military situation was certainly, because we were cut off. Then uh uh we...we knew that this... my geography was good enough for that that I knew we were walking out of the province of Brandenburg (ph) towards Meklenburg (ph) somehow, to the north, and then uh we passed by, interesting enough, one stretch where we saw a terrible picture of uh dead horses and corpses and and and uh destruction because in the night before American fliers had had uh uh uh , they <span class="page-break" number="17"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 5 almost...it was just on the day of my birthday I remember, on the April 26th, we were somewhere in a place, in a beautiful area but uh and the question came up should we try to escape, but uh here again the question was uh uh to which extent could you rely on the German population.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: OK. So this...explain something, if you would, because I...it was a little unclear. You were still then under guard?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Still under guard. They were still shooting if anybody is tried to get away and we were still...though we were...from the air we were bombarded, but also the guards were still there. The guards uh uh were not very happy about this because they were also afraid of their lives, especially that that they would be subjected to attacks. After twelve days I think, we were driven to a point where it was was...all this area is is forest area, at least it was at this time, and when we were walking...a real pretty week I must say...I had some of my friends still with me, not to loose contact with them. Uh all of a sudden a bicyclist, a motor bicyclist, a German with a bicyclist came and said to the to the SS guards there, idiots, where are you going. The Americans are already in 5 <span class="page-break" number="18"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 6 later realized that we were walking into some kind of a military pocket...the Russians in the back of us and the Allied armies in front of us, and uh in the middle of the night it was...no, not middle...it it it was just getting dark...the Russian guns really uh sent their shells and they came they came closer and closer, and almost threatening and at this moment I said to my friend...we...[ saw some of the Polish people, Polish political prisoners we had in our area, said well, this enough, we run. And I said to my friend, I think this is also the time for us to run, so we left the the the fire and we left the horse meat and we left whatever...but just whatever we could grab, especially a blanket or so, and we ran towards a road. The SS was still there and when they see us or saw us running, they were still shooting after us, but luckily uh our name tag was not on their on their on their bullet, and then all of a sudden uh we reached an area...meantime it had become dark, where we were we were somehow in no man's land, but not completely because on that road we had to reach, there we saw the the remnants of the German army, also trying to make their way to the north, and refugees obviously coming from Berlin with all kinds of vehicles, fire trucks, hearses, milk trucks...whatever moved, they had used, and sometimes put together because they didn't have enough gasoline anymore, so they had tied...had tied these together, and we then said well, probably the safest is to mix with these people, and after all, I had thrown away the the the the stripped coat and I took...had thrown...not thrown away but put it my pocket the the cap, so I I looked at least like a civilian, and my friends also whatever they had. We mixed with the the population, and uh so they walked rather slowly. There was no marching because there were hundreds and thousands of people, pressing towards the north. They obviously knew that they were pressing towards some kind of of of army lines, of the American army or the British army. Nobody knew who was operating there, so uh uh then in this way we were walking the whole night. We heard some shooting. We didn't know what it was. We were even stuck by by some German soldiers and they said...and luckily we spoke This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

So uh uh and then you know all of a sudden we were safe and we realized and I realized at this moment uh...well, I was with friends but I was alone, that uh uh I had...when I was still in Auschwitz, uh one day a fellow had come from Birkenau, and uh that was a time believe it or not that we still believed that women and children would be around, would be alive, and we asked him, have you heard that is in Birkenau there are children and and women, and he said are you crazy. I lived in Birkenau now for a year and a half, next to the gas chambers. When you arrived what happened, and I told him that my wife and my child too was taken away immediately. With that he said I'm sorry to tell you there's no hope, and I still could not completely...completely believe it, though we lived already in the shadows of the crematorium and the shadows of the gas chambers, but then when I reached the line on...was the night from from May 2nd to May 3rd, 1945, which I call my and our second birthday, I realized I was alone. I was certain my parents were gone, my family was gone and and and I was joyful but at the same time terribly sad, because I couldn't share in the joys of the other...for instance, of the Belgium fellow and the French fellow and and the Dutch fellow who was certain that they could go home soon and and go back to normal life and find their home and find their families. I knew I had no family anymore.</p><p>I had no home anymore and and I had...I don't know...didn't know what the future would be, but really, that was that was what what made this moment so so terribly sad.

Uh we didn't take any of that to shoot the SS. It didn't occur to us. We were not made that way. It probably would have been better to do it, but we trusted uh that justice would would prevail and that that these criminals would would would get what they deserved to. Well, that's another story. We reached the cityof We came to the...we were directed to the to the...by the way, on the way we saw, for instance, American troops. They were they were cold, but they had put on a fire and they had gotten somewhere bundles of German marks, you know. They were using these bundles to to lit a fire, and came...we were directed to a building which was called military government...that was new to me.</p><p>Military government...I didn't know what it meant, but it was closed. Six o'clock...there was no office hours, you know. So uh uh and and uh I didn't know what to do. One of my friends I was with was very sick.

I said they achieve nothing, just to hope that something will happen, but and then work on it to uh to uh to get to Belsen two weeks later, which was not easy because I was still...they have strict controls but I was able in the meantime with the help of another Jewish-American soldiers to organize a small car and and and to get visas was a whole experience (coughing).

This is a technical thing because 10,000...you know, under German tules and regulations you are giv...you are responsible if you loose, you are responsible for all the costs in court and of the other...of the lawyers of the other side, but 10,000 guarantees you also to run a petition of appeal, so uh when that...when the verdict came out I was already in the United States and in the German papers, there was an outcry, even headlines, that I'm endangering Germany industry because not only had taken had taken slave labors, but also <span class="page-break" number="31"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 2 their lawyers found that if they hadn't uh taken us as slaves in in Auschwitz, then we under normal conditions probably would have to go to the Russian front and could have been killed there easily so I say this is something which is is unbelievable.

I had not been a prisoner because I had uh uh committed fraud or or or uh embezzlement, so obviously these attempts were in vain, so therefore in this respect I was never attacked. I was attacked in the German press in another connection. I was, as I indicated before, a witness in a couple of uh uh war...call it war crime trials. Uh the first was in Nuremburg against su where I was a witness and gave evidence especially against the man who was inchargeof sin Auschwitz, Dr. ___, who by the way was sent to prison but very soon released and very soon got a terrific position again in German industry uh so uh uh then I was a witness in...when I was still in Germany, against this film director who created a vicious poisonous anti-Semitic movie called</p><p> , the story of .

What kind of goodness do we expect from them? So then at the end of it, interesting enough, when the judgment was was rendered, I was considered as unfri...unfriendly witness. Now after that, when I came back, I I asked a friend of mine who was writing articles for the Times and so, that I had enough, that I would never accept an invitation again to go to give evidence before a German court, and certainly this article found its way into into the German press, and was re...reprinted there, and the uh there was a semi-Nazi paper in Germany called the and the <span class="page-break" number="32"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 8 the central organization in Berlin and when we had the first air attacks there by the British...by the British uh uh air force, uh we were uh taking cover, or we had to take cover in a so-called air shelter which was nothing, with no protection. Uh with the other members working in that office and very often Leo Beck would...certainly came. He was a very, very uh disciplined worker and and uh uh he uh he gave all the time to the Jewish work and I tell you in a moment why. Uh he was there and we we were listening when the bombs were falling, and he told us well this is far or this is very close or so. Why? Because he was one of the few with experiences of World War I. He had been an Army rabbi, especially in in France, so he was familiar with with with the military...with military practice, so he could teach us or could enlighten us if the bombs were deadly close to us or the ones were far away so we didn't have to worry about it. Leo Beck was, for instance, a man uh when he his wife died...I think in 1938, sometime ..uh he got offers from a lot of universities <span class="page-break" number="32"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 9</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I want to ask you just to repeat Leo Beck's name because I'll need it that way for the tape.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.

Leo Beck was incarcerated in Theresienstadt, in . There was a practice in that uh uh the name of famous people, let us say of leaders, of Jewish leaders from Austria, from Czechoslovakia, and so who were all incarcerated in , who had to be reported to <span class="page-break" number="34"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 1 and there was also something else which L...and it's the last I want to say about him. In uh in writings, especially also in the book of ____ about the banality of evil, there were very unfair text against him, against Leo Beck, based on a story which I consider a historic lie. In 1945 a man who had entered Germany with the American army and who wanted to make probably a quick buck, wrote stories of survivors uh under the title "We Have Survived." And he published one story which he published in such a way as if it was the writing by Leo Beck, but anybody who was familiar with the writings of Leo Beck could see immediately that it was not his writing. And he told of the story that Leo Beck had been advised in 1944 by somebody who had escaped Auschwitz successfully, who had come to Theresienstadt to advise him that in Auschwitz people are being gassed, and he kept it as a secret and did not make it known to the people around him. I personally consider this as a I say, a historical lie. First of all, the number of people who succ...Jewish people who successfully uh escaped Auschwitz, you can count on one or two hands of your of your of your two fingers of your hand, but number two that a man would have the folly to escape as a Jew successfully from Auschwitz, make his way into Theresienstadt, penetrate the the wires or the walls or whatever it is, to look up especially Leo Beck and tell him, listen, 1 want you to know they are gassing in Auschwitz. It's so absurd. I asked especially in the work I did for the...with the...after the ____, I went...I was...I met hundreds and thousands of fellow survivors, if that fellow heard about somebody who had come from from Auschwitz and gone to Theresienstadt. They never heard about it because it's absurd. It's abso...not only absurd. I would say it's obscene, but <span class="page-break" number="35"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 2 and I'll write an article and make a statement and so and he wouldn't do it. And I say I I...he was he was he was absolutely he was he was a great man. Unfortunately uh uh his...you know, because he lived at a time which was a terrible time, he could not live up to his full potential, you know, as a as a spiritual leader, but whatever...whatever he wrote after...it's interesting. When we took I remember, people told me when he came to London, and for the first time they asked him to speak to the people and there was an overcrowded hall and they thought he would talk about something about Theresienstadt. Not a word. He talked about _, about Moses Mendelson (ph), about about whoever he wanted to, but not about Theresienstadt, because he doesn't...didn't want to be want to be to give even the appearance of a hero who is a survivor. So may I say...may I close with with this remark...everybody is reacting to this chapter differently, and and and and I'm glad that I had the opportunity to to tell you. Probably I could cover hours and hours more of that, but it's my belief that what what you are doing here and what the the Holocaust Museum is doing by putting the archives together together is of tremendous importance and of tremendous value, irrespective of the revisionists uh telling us Auschwitz was a hoax or like in that book of uh David Irvin (ph) with pages and pages just tried to prove that Hitler did...never knew about the Holocaust. It was only...it was only Himmler and the others, or the attempts to say just uh Hitler and Himmler and</p><p> are guilty, but all the others are...I never believed in collective guilt, and we never <span class="page-break" number="36"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 3 bigotry is evil.
