And actually it happened then yes. But I could not, I was too young actually to make a decision or to tell my father it will be better to stay out of the country or go away.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But he was staying in Brno still?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He was still staying in Brno. This was a mistake.</p></p></dialogue>
