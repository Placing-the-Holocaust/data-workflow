And actually it happened then yes. But I could not, I was too young actually to make a decision or to tell my father it will be better to stay out of the country or go away.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But he was staying in Brno still?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He was still staying in Brno. This was a mistake.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: At that time, in 38, what did Hitler mean to you as a 13 year old boy?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Actually he meant very much to me because at the time when the Germans came in, so actually immediately they, because of my appearance, yes, they could think that I am Jewish.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Hans Ziegler 40 December 21, 2012 things about my former life, about the Holocaust and about the, about my experience in the camp in Berlin and the camp in Postelberg. So and I don't think that they were very -- they know about it, yes. But they didn't question too much about that. You --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But, yeah go on.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Two of the sons are medical doctors, and the third one -- because my wife was a medical doctor. And the third one is studying construction and is a construction engineer, a building engineer. So actually they did very well. I'm very happy with my family and even with my sons because they developed in very good and useful people and I am very happy about that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Are there any sights or sounds or smells or something that make you think of the war time years when you were in Postelberg or in Berlin? Today, is there anything that reminds you of that time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Of course I -- it does because about the time in Berlin I wrote a book. I wrote a book with a friend of mine which spent the time in Berlin with me. So actually I had a lot possibilities to think about the time and I even visited Berlin many years later to see about the areas and about the places where I actually spent my time in Berlin.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell me a little bit more about the book.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well it's actually a book which happens about the time when we were at the school and how we were taken about the school and what we actually thought about the whole thing on the trip, because nobody actually knew where he is going. We didn't know that we were going to Berlin to take care about the dead people and about the ruins there. And we were actually astonished when we landed at Berlin, the capital of Germany and had to be there almost one half a year and do the job. So this handles about the book and then it handles about actually the time when the Germans came to occupy the Czech area. And then it handles about even about the time that the Czech Republic changed to the communist republic.
