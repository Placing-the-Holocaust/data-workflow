<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: ... and where you were born?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I am Robert Treuer, I was born in Vienna, Austria, January 31st, 1926. My family, my parents and I, I was the only child were considered Jewish even though we did not practice the religion, and know I had my grandparents and I am told, my great-grandparents. However, in the European system, such as it was, we were considered Jews, and when I started first grade, and school began with the saying of the Lord's prayer, the teacher rapped an interruption and pointed to me and said you can't say that, you have to be quiet while the rest of the children say the Lord's prayer, and we'll start over again, and they did. I vividly remember March of 1938, when the Nazi's came in. I remember the tension during the days beforehand. I was awakened about two in the morning by SA troops marching in front of our house, singing the song, marching <span class="page-break" number="0"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> border near Czechoslovakia, bringing in underground newspapers from Czechoslovakia, and he and an associate distributed these newspapers. What happened was that he had been very active in the social democratic party, particularly in youth and children's activities and cultural activities until the fascist takeover in 1934 and the fighting that then erupted. My father was involved, he had tried to distribute guns from the back stoop of his store. I saw the fighting, I saw the , the national <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> that my father took long summer vacations, during which he established a new identity as an itinerant farm laborer on farms along the Austrian-Czechoslovak border. The growth of the Austrian Nazi party was palpable, although again as a child I did not, that did not register with me particularly. When the Nazis, or when Anschluss came, in March of 1938, and the German army marched in unopposed, either by Austria or any other international community, and apparently with the tacit backing of Mussolini in Italy, the reception that I saw of the German troops, you know the Nazis, by the Austrian population was overwhelming. And for example, many of the active socialists, even those in the underground, switched parties and joined the Nazi party. Some of them warned my father that because they knew, now the Nazis would know about his underground activities and that he and his associate, Ernst Pollit(ph) would be very wise to cut it out immediately.</p><p>My father, Fritz Treuer, was under no illusions what the advent of the Nazis meant, he knew about the Nuremberg laws, about the persecution of the Jews, about confiscation of property, and he immediately started making efforts to get us out of the country. Some of the rest of our relatives were not as alarmed as he was, my mother's two sisters and their husbands, professional people, thought that well, they were engineers, they had particular skills that were in demand and they didn't, while things might be unpleasant, there was no great danger. My father tried to tell them otherwise and was not believed. He also tried to get three or four Jewish boys together and give us the beginnings of rudimentary military training in somebody's garden behind a house, a high hedge or a wall around it, it lasted exactly two times, two afternoons after school. Somebody saw us, it was reported and one the erstwhile socialists got ahold of Dad and said this had better stop right now or you're going to get nailed. That was the end of that. My accordion teacher, who came to our house in a streetcar, was stopped in the street. He was a very large man, his name was Hamlish, and very curly black hair, he was immediately taken for a Jew by passing by Nazis, who began This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

It was impossible, they were armed. That was the last accordion lesson. Hamlish incidentally, and his wife managed to escape, I'm not sure exactly how they came to New York, they subsequently had children born in this country, one of whom is Marvin Hamlish, a musical arranger.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I wanted to ask, before the Anschluss, and you mentioned specifically that when you were in school and you were sitting in, you were in the classroom singing and they stopped, the teacher asked you to stop, was that the only incident that was before March 1938?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, the only incident of anti-Semitism that I experienced?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No, there were many, that was just a representative?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was a representative, there were many, and on the street there was the usual bullying. My parents took the attitude that whether it was racial or not, I had to fight my own fights, which I did.</p><p>The anti-Semitism was generic and general and you picked up on it in many subtle ways. It was not usually violent, except as when kids fought on the streets, although I do remember one incident which may give you the flavor of it, is before the Anschluss, some of us kids were playing in the street and I was, chasing each other, reckless, I didn't look, plunging across the street head first and ran into a bicyclist hard enough, I bent the front wheel of his bike badly enough so he couldn't ride it. I got some good cuts and bruises out of that one, but he immediately found out who I was, knew who my father was and he was a local Nazi, remember this was before the Anschluss, and he marched me and his damaged bike to Dad's store and swung enough weight by virtue of his party membership so that before Dad could even attend to me and take me to the emergency room, which was done later, he had to pay the man off for the damage to the bike, cash then and there or else, and the or else could and probably would have been beatings, damage to the store, what have you.

There were round-ups of Jews in the streets, made to scrub the streets. This happened to a distant relative of ours, and elderly woman, not in good health and when some of the people standing around made remarks about that to the storm troopers who were conducting the street scrubbing, one of them walked over to the woman and said, well I think maybe you can get up and leave, it seems you're not Jewish, and she said, yes I am, I'm 400% Jewish, all four of my grandparents are Jews. A similar thing happened to my mother who was rounded up between piano lessons, on the streets of Vienna, and she was blonde, blue-eyed, petite. If you wanted a poster girl for your Aryan woman, she would have been it, and again when she was down there scrubbing streets, people started to mutter that these stupid SS men, SA men didn't know what they were doing, look at this, and one of them told mom to get up and get out of there and she said, no I'm Jewish, I belong here the same as the rest of these people, I'll go when they go. And I think that was a very short-lived, street scrubbing. It wasn't always that kind.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So immediately after Anschluss, you immediately felt an impact on your personal lives?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: It was immediate and it was massive. In the popular support, and you heard nothing against it, no one spoke against it, and my parents got busy, my father particularly. Remember him telling my mother that it was only a matter of days before the Nuremberg laws were applied, as indeed they were, and that they had to do everything possible to get out of the country. Now I later came across, in my parents personal papers, and then they're both dead now, correspondence to Bolivia, Mexico, Chili, anywhere possible to get out. What eventually happened was that my mother found employment as a housemaid in a rural English household, I think through an employment agency.</p><p>Through a refugee agency, a place was found for me in an English boarding school, an Orthodox Jewish boarding school which would take me in, because the law at that time was if you were an</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

We were taken to the railway station, the , the west railway in Vienna by my father and a few family friends, I had no brothers or <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> that she gave me birth. The trip through Belgium on the train was uneventful and the channel crossing eventful only by my getting sick to my stomach. Took the _ train to London where my father's brother was waiting for us. I don't know how he got out, I suspect he was in London illegally, but I don't know the circumstances. He met us at the train, took us to a hotel. As we rounded the corner to enter the hotel, roof to floor, Nazi banners are flying there and I panicked, I was terrified, I didn't know what had happened, were we back in Germany or what? But it turned out some sporting event and the Nazi team was being hosted in London. The next morning my mother took the train for her employment out in the country side. My uncle took me to the school where I was to attend. Turned out to be an Orthodox Jewish school. The headmaster, my recollection is a black coat, white shirt, black tie, a black hat, full beard. Looked me over as I was brought into his office and said this boy is not a Jew. My hair was . My uncle assured him that <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> secular. I don't know, but before the end of the day he had found another school that would take me in free, there was no money. What little our family had had been sequestered and we had no money. This school turned out to be a snake pit. My first night there, sleeping in the large dormitory with many other boys my age, one started screaming in great pain, and I tried to find out from the boy in the bed next to mine what was going on and I didn't understand the English, and he pointed at his appendix and I knew what that was, the boy had appendicitis and he screamed for a long time before finally some of the staff showed up and the gist of what they had told him was to turn over and pray. Well I understood that clearly enough, I found myself in a place where if you had appendicitis, you prayed. The next day the other kids went to various classes, I had no English, they told me to hang around in the kitchen and I did. I was raped before the day was out, by a staff member. I told no one. I felt responsible for what had happened, it was my fault. I didn't find <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> makes me think that he was there illegally. There was a small handful of Austrian socialists there who tried to help each other and apparently he would sleep with one family one night or two and then move on and I didn't tell him what happened to me. He could tell quickly enough that something was out of whack but he didn't know what, nor could he do much about it except that he did get me out of there. He made connections with another Vienna socialist who was the director of a refugee camp for Spanish orphans, these were the orphans of , the surviving children from <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0 and finally a smell of a little victory somewhere and then the death notices, oh yeah. There's an incident that happened to me in Vienna before we left that I want to tell you, two of them. I was riding the streetcar, forget whether it was on the way to school or from school, and a bunch of Hitler youth spotted me, and they must have seen the Jewish insignia on my streetcar pass, and one of them said, get him, and I leaped off the streetcar, ran in front of it, there was one coming the other way and the motorman was clanging with his footbell because the two were just about head to head and I had ducked in front of that one and ran. I remember correctly, I ran across the street, over a wall and onto the grounds of the House, a hospital in the 19th district in Vienna, but by <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 1</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yes, I wanted at first to talk about your father, you mentioned before Anschluss, before he was involved with the Socialists, but at the time you didn't know that, that was something you learned afterwards?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was something I learned afterwards.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But did you remember anything about him going to meetings or friends that he was . . .</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He did, now during that __ between the time the fascists took over in 1934 and the Anschluss in 1938, he did take me with him to visit friends sometimes and I remember one time he was visiting a friend and, who played a Victrola or phonograph for him of some Schubert __, and they were saying oh, we better keep the volume down, this one is forbidden. It was a Schubert song, I forget now, , Your Thoughts are Free, well that was forbidden, and one of the things <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 2 paper, was that he did a lot of typing, mimeographing for a man by the name of Leon Schalit, who was the official translator of Galsworthy's works into German, and what Dad and his associate did was slipsheet the underground newspapers into the book manuscript to be returned to Schalit, and Ernst Pollit(ph) who helped my Dad, had to make almost daily trips back and forth between Dad's shop and Schalit's home, and this was a means of getting the newspapers out. Ironically, a high Vienna police official lived in the same building that housed my dad's store and had two armed guards standing in front of the building all the time and they would check Pollit(ph) periodically and find out what he was carrying, but the packages were so big and heavy and clumsy that they didn't want to bother with him and they saw him every day, so they were never caught for that. During the first days of the fascist takeover in "34, the underground newspaper was printed on the presses of the largest newspaper in Vienna. After that paper had finished it's first run, the printer stayed behind and ran off the underground newspaper. They got away with that for months until some bookkeeper upstairs in the office found out that the electricity bills were higher than they used to be and they got caught. Yeah. Well one thing leads to another, I remember my father meeting with some streetcar motorman and the discussion was how to distribute underground newspapers at a big football game, and they came up with this system that the streetcar line ended next to the football stadium and that the motorman had a few minutes between runs and they used, they would ball up the newspapers and fire them over the outside walls of the stadium with slingshots, and they fell amongst the audience. Not a very efficient system, but what can you do? You wanted to ask some?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh sure, again about your father, you mentioned it was, this was after March 1938, or was it, maybe I didn't understand, but he during the summertime went and he created another identity, you said, as a?</p></p></dialogue>

He did this before the Nazis came, he had a pretty keen sense of what might happen, and I believe continued that after he had shipped Mom and me out of Vienna. He closed the apartment.</p><p>All the goods and contents had been taken anyhow by the concierge's daughter and son-in-law, he was SS, they took the whole apartment and Dad just disappeared and I believe he lapsed into that identity, but in mean, had to come back again frequently to process his papers for his exit. Now, his recollections tome __ Vienna visits, were that he had to stand in a long line at a hotel in Vienna, downtown Vienna, I believe he said it was the Imperial if 1 remember correctly, had been taken over by SS, to process exit visas and what have you. He said as he got there early in the morning, two lines had formed, he stood in the one he believed he had to go through, and the other line were elderly couples and it turned out that these people were undergoing compulsory divorce if one was Aryan and the other one Jewish, they were compelled to be divorced and he described to me not only the utter silence in which both lines inched forward, but the weeping, the old people as they came back down, not knowing where to go, what to do, with whom they could be. It was pitiful, absolutely pitiful. During that time also, while my father was back and forth between Vienna and his farm laborer identity, he had to pass a medical examination, which revealed him to have a hernia. The Nazis wouldn't let him out unless that were operated on. He underwent the operation and was not given anesthesia and pleaded with the doctor for anesthetic after the incision was started and the doctor put the scalpel down, he said, you have your choice, if you want your exit papers signed, you'll let us go ahead, otherwise I can sew you up right now, and Dad said go ahead, and he eventually fainted. He moved from room to room when he was in Vienna and went through</p><p> , and had to come back to Vienna once again a couple of days before he had a ticket to get <span class="page-break" number="11"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 4 trucks pulled up, they were going door to door. They came, and he was renting a lower room for one night in somebody else's apartment and he heard them coming and he was on the way out, and they came to his apartment and they were in the room before his, and he watched them through a crack in the door, didn't know how to get out and suddenly they were preoccupied with finding a World War 1 bayonet in somebody's dresser drawer and the man to whom it belonged was anxiously explaining what this was and so on, they were all clustered around him, so Dad marched out of the room, snapped a Heil(ph) Hitler salute and they didn't turn around, they said Heil(ph) Hitler, he walked past them or out. We'll never know whether they were looking for him or anybody in particular but he got out. Got out, came to England and he and Mom wound up working in the same household. Now maybe I'd better backtrack because by that time, I was no longer in England.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You had left England just shortly after the Anschluss, the middle of 1938?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We left Austria, my mother and I, in August of "38. Anschluss was in March. My Dad didn't come out until November, December, something like that.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p> 5</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And the second one, what you said was, I wanted to ask about that, that was obviously very difficult, how long were you there? Just a few days or?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It's a time warp, I'm not sure. I would thinks some weeks, I'm not sure how long, nor can I say with accuracy how long I was in the Spanish children's home. No sense of time. But you realize even that wasn't secure, because I was there illegally, and unbeknownst to me, the Society of Friends, the Quakers were working on my situation and found a place for me that was both safe and legal, and that was Newtown Boarding School in Waterford, Ireland. I made the trip, I believe alone. Arrangements had been made for an Irish Quaker family in Dublin to meet me and they in turn put me on the train from Dublin to Waterford. I thought myself very competent and capable and and doing a lot of traveling on my own and coping with a lot of different situations, I <span class="page-break" number="13"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p></p></dialogue>

And quite literally, Newtown school and the Quakers, Mr. Marsh, not only saved my life in that they saved me from deportation, they saved my life spiritually. Started me out on a long journey of finding my own worth. Let's take a break.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. [pause] I just wanted to ask about the incident at the school, when you were raped, did you know the person well? It was just the second day you were there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was the second day I was there, he was working in the kitchen and before I knew it, I don't know, I can't recall just how he got me into the men's latrine, I recall the latrine, smelly, narrow.</p><p>Afterwards I felt that I had lured him there, and that couldn't have been. That could not have been.</p><p>That was my recollection, that was my feeling at the time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you able to make any friends there, or was it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you don't really...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I was a solitary, and again I don't remember exactly how long I was there, it was, it had to have been a couple of weeks at least. I remember Uncle Richard coming to get me on a Sunday to take me on an outing, he took me to Hyde Park, he tried to explain to me people speaking on their soapboxes, I was totally by then and he was really leaning on me hard to learn English, and <span class="page-break" number="14"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 7</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, that was a one time incident there, but there are many forms of victimization. I was sexually abused or assaulted or whatever you want to call it on at least two other occasions. Not in that school, but over subsequent years. And I think it had less to do with my being physically small than with my body language and how I felt about myself. I think that's commonplace for victims. I've had to do a lot of work on that, but it helps to talk about it, and it my talking about it helps somebody else, I'm glad to do it. I have taken four of my seven children back to Austria. I've taken them to Dachau, which of course is in Germany, near Munich, I've taken them to Mauthausen, which to me is the epitome of horror, and in Mauthausen, ah, the quarry, yeah. But at Mauthausen, there are the instructions on what to do with the pregnant women when they were brought in, and the instructions said, up to the eighth month, abort them. After the eighth month, kill the child.</p><p>That was done through suffocation, injection, smash the skull or use them for medical experiments.</p><p>God damn it. Hell, I wanted my children to know, they were wanted, and that there was a time when infants were killed and the children were killed. And my father's mountain climbing partner, his name was Shreiber(ph) wound up at Mauthausen, and we found out what happened to him, he was a strong man, he was short but he was strong mountain climber, he and Dad, the Alps, and</p><p> , and he was one of those who had to carry the 50 kilo boulder up those 186 uneven steps to <span class="page-break" number="15"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 8 children to see the beauty of Austria and the mountains and the people and the horror. And I hope, I pray and I hope that I can, that I have taught my children that the capacity to harm another human being exists in each of us. And this does not excuse the holocaust, where society evoked <span class="page-break" number="15"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 9 exploited for her safety. Yeah, we buy, we buy our survival in many ways, and I was judgmental and critical as a 12 year old, for only a very short time. A matter of seconds, but that strange rapport and that love I then formed with those Spanish peers of mine, has off and on touched my life several times. It's hard to define or explain. When I was what, 15, 16? I worked for a few weeks one summer for the Pioneer Corn Company, corn, even though I was short and it was <span class="page-break" number="15"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 0 visa application and his sand so on and so on. And ultimately he got out to England, there was a long delay for him in England because somebody lost his passport there, at one of the embassies. But finally all the papers were gathered and a telegram was sent to me in Ireland to come back to England forthwith, and I made that journey alone, Mr. Marsh saw me off, he said do you want me to go with you as far as the boat ferry, and I said, no, what for? But he saw me off at the ferry. Wonderful man. To the train, took the train to the ferry. Met my parents in London and took another train to Southampton. We had to board a German ship flying the swastika because that's how they got the last of our money, it was an unpleasant trip and ironically the boat was virtually empty, not because at that time the Nazis wouldn't let you go, because nobody'd let you in.</p></p></dialogue>

He finally got on a ship, Dad and Mom tried to help get him into the States, but somehow he wangled a way to Canada, got on board ship in Spain, Ernst Pollit(ph) did. Who does he meet on that ship? His wife, who had thought him dead, he had thought her dead. Crazy. No rhyme, no reason. Don't ask me to assign the hand of God to any rescue. I'm not God's . I'm only a witness. I am a survivor and a witness. Take a break. <span class="page-break" number="18"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
