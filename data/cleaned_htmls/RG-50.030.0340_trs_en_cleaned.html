If you want to also say I am--.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Okay, my name was Bella Maschinsky at that point, but I was born Bella Berger on September 9, 1922. I lived in Lodz, which is the largest industrial city in Poland. I had a little sister. My immediate family, father, mother, little sister and a whole slew of uncles, aunts, cousins and so on. And, I was going to school in Poland. I felt pretty much comfortable in Poland. Sometimes I wondered whether I was more Polish than Jewish or those things were parallel and did not have an affect personally on me. Also, I knew about anti-semitism and Poland did not touch me personally. I was going to school. I had lots of friends. I had Jewish friends, non-Jewish friends, and I was never directly involved in Judaism. Also, my grandparents were very religious. So, I felt okay in Poland, even knowing that there is anti- semitism, because Poles were anti-semitic from day one, probably before they are born they are anti-semitic. But it was not an obvious kind of thing I personally experienced. Until 1939, let -- Q. I just want to ask you a little more about your family life before we go on to the war.</p><p>What kind of business you father was in?</p><p>A. My father was working. He was an insurance salesman. My grandfather had a factory which made bricks and my uncles were very involved in textiles. They were fairly comfortable off, not rich, rich like a lot of Jews in Lodz were, but they were comfortable. Politically, I was exposed to the discussions of my aunts and uncles. I had about four or five uncles and three aunts, and they all belonged to a different political group. They were zionists. My father was a , So Israel was not something he would think about or Palestine, at that <span class="page-break" number="0"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> particular time. He felt we should be happy where we are and the whole idea. He was the only one of the whole lot. I had one uncle who was very hasidic. You know, had the long and the whole bit. So, I was always exposed to those discussions, even as a little girl. Not that I participated, I was not a joiner. I was not zionist, I was not a . I was just a happy go lucky young girl with friends and school, and that's how <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> became very dangerous. By September 1, when war broke out, Hitler immediately ordered his troops, immediately overrun Lodz. It took two days and here they were. The Army I was so proud of, you know, the calvary with their white gloves and the beautiful pasture with the horses was disengaged and here we were under Hitler. And one law after the other followed in immediate succession. Schools were closed. People were dismissed from their work. We could no longer walk on the streets. We had to walk on the sidewalk. We had to put yellow stars on both hands and then fires broke out everywhere. And I can still smell, almost smell the synagogue burning and the Germans rounding up the men on the street, especially the ones with the beards and paftins, we had a lot of them in Lodz. And they had to dance around and the Germans and the Poles were just looking at it with such joy and glee that it just shattered my mind and made me a very, very frightened person. All that was going on. I stayed under German Nazi rule in Poland until December of 1939, and at that time, the whole feeling was let's escape, let's go where he isn't. Poland was divided, at that time, in two parts. One part of Poland the Russians took over and one part the Germans took over, so the idea was to escape the part where the Germans are and go to the part where Russia is. So, one night we were sitting and people were just knock at the door, knock at the door, and men were taken out, women were taken out. It was just a fearful, fearful situation.</p><p>Q. What was going on in the streets? I mean did you pretty much stay home and hide out?</p><p>A. They couldn't because they were rushed out of their homes by the Poles and Germans.</p><p>They might come into a house and say all Jews out. Then they would surround the men and some of them were never heard of. There were men going to work, with pails of water cleaning the streets, and we were very easily recognizable because you had to wear a Jewish star. You could not go to a store and buy anything because it wasn't being sold to Jews, so there was a little</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

The predominant fact was the fear. Is my father going to go outside and ever come back? Am I am going to go outside and ever come back? Are they going to surround our apartment. It was the unknown of what they're going to do, but it was known that they were gong to do something.</p><p>Q. Was there obvious brutality in the streets?</p><p>A. Yes. The Hitler . We had a lot of Germans in Lodz, and the youngsters.</p><p>"You there, you there, you there," you know back and forth with clubs, especially for the man it was worse than for the women. They were just using sticks, throwing stones. It was a free for all. There was no one to protect the Jews. We kind of became immediately second class people, not even citizens or a part of the community. By December we had a kind of family meeting and I just felt that I could not stay there. On other hand, the feeling was well, that's your home. You have a roof over you. You just don't walk out of the house, not in "39. People did it later, but not in'39. So, we made a decision that father and I are going to go on the other side to the Russians.</p><p>We're going to find quarters, send for my mother and my little sister, and we'll establish some kind of roots away from the Germans under the Russian occupation. And that's what we did.</p><p>That was middle of December "39. So, my father and I didn't look what they call the term, I didn't look Jewish. We took the stars off and we set out to go to the Russians. It wasn't a unique idea. Thousands of people had the same idea, and proceeded to go like that. Also, the Poles tried to go to the countryside rather than stay in the city, so you were facing moving sidewalks.</p><p>People, people, people, moving with bags on their backs. Suitcases, horse and buggy, but it was just a moving stream of people, so we set out and our first direction was Warsaw. Now, I don't know if you're aware of how Poland was divided. But towards that was part of <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> Ghetto yet in Lodz so we were living in our own homes. When we got to Warsaw, found out that all Jews lived in a Ghetto. We sneaked into the Ghetto and it was a horror. Dirty, hunger, they were so much worse off than we were, and there was no place for us to stay or did we have a desire to stay. So, after being there two days, we sneaked out of the Ghetto and continued our trip to the Russian side. As we walked towards, not knowing exactly where we were going, but general directions, and since we were not unique, and there were hundreds and hundreds of people, you start talking to people. We found ourselves close to a family and they say well they are going to the Russian part too, and they have a maid who lives not far from the Russian border. They are going there and she is going to bring them over. We are free to join them.</p><p>Well, that was a wonderful opportunity, since we didn't know where we were going, and so we joined the group of people. Sure enough, we got to the house of the maid which was not far from the border.</p><p>Q. How long had you been walking?</p><p>A. Oh, maybe two weeks. Maybe a week, something like that.</p><p>Q. In the winter?</p><p>A. Yes, well it was December. We get to the farm house and the maid greets them and also us with warmth and they have it all ready. They had a room ready for all of us and they were going to sneak in because it was still German occupation. They were sneaking in food for us in the evening, and then the first opportunity they have that they feel the road is clear, they are going to bring us over. I was observing the whole situation and it became very uncomfortable for me. I say, why does it take them so long. Something isn't right. And I was not wrong. We were there about two days and then in the middle of the night there is a knock. The doors from the place where we stayed on that farm, rip open and here is a German patrol escorted by the</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

We were in just one room, completely surrounded and the first thing was your money, your this, your that. So, father and I very quietly kind of went towards the door, and as they were so busy plundering the baggage, suitcases, we sneaked out, but I had nothing but the clothes I was wearing and so did father. We just blindly headed for the forest. It was dark, it was cold. We had no directions. I turned around, there is no father. So, I found myself in that forest not knowing quite where I am going but heading for the direction away from the farmhouse. I must have run all night. First I tried to find father, which was almost impossible. Well, I never did, and when daylight started I found myself on the outskirts of a little town. It was cold. I was hungry. I was upset. Putting it mildly, I was desperate, when a woman approaches me and she must have sensed that I was not from that part of town or country, whatever I was. She approaches me and says why are you on the street at that hour?</p><p>That's not allowed. And I said, I was just attacked by the Poles and Germans and I was running.</p><p>Where am I? She says, "Come with me." And she took me to her house. She was a Jewish woman who went to fetch some water and took a chance to get some water when the Germans and Poles aren't out, that's why she was on the street. She took me to her house, her home, if you can call it such. It was a one room house, one room living quarters, and she had three little boys and a very pious Jews, sitting there praying and she gave me a little bit of food. Put me right next to the stove and tried to find out from where I am, what am I doing and so on, and I told her that that's what happened to me. My intent is to go over to the Russian part of Poland. She says, well that's very hard, but I'll see what I can do for you. She evidently was -- I don't know what her position in that little town was, whether she was a rabbi's wife, but knew the community.</p><p>She went at night, she went over and she came back and she says I'll give you a way to go over</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

They are smugglers. That's the trade they have.</p><p>Q. Were these Jewish smugglers?</p><p>A. Yes. I had nothing. I had no papers, no money, nothing literally zilch. She brought me over to the smugglers. They looked me over for some reason they say okay, we'll take you with us. So, I was very fortunate without the help of those strangers who stretched out their hand because they felt sorry for me or I just looked different to whatever they were, I can't explain it.</p><p>But they were so kind. The smugglers took me with them. What they did were they were smuggling shoes, but just to assure themselves that nobody is going to grab from them what they grabbed from someone else, they first carried all left shoes, and then made the next trip with bags of right shoes and then the two bags got together and they had hundreds of pairs of shoes. But they worked with the Poles and Germans, so when they came around, the smugglers and I and the shoes went to a little where German patrol was standing and under their <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> sorry for someone when there is one, two, three, but there were hundreds of people like me.</p><p>Maybe not all alone, but so I only had kindness from them. Then they had a place on the other side of the river where Poles were waiting and they collected their shoes, and then we parted company. The Poles even offered me to stay with them, and you know, you don't have to go any further, stay here. But, I wasn't trusting anyone. I took advantage of their kindness but never trusted them. So, then they went about their way and I continued. Now, I was on the Russian site, but I still had no money. I still didn't know where to go, and my recollection was that as we were still at home, my uncles took the route before us, and they were mentioning the city of</p><p> . So, I said I have to get to , and maybe some how, some way, I had no address or no names of people, I contact them, find them. It's not unusual to meet people on the street, because everybody was walking. It took me two weeks to get to .</p><p>There was no transportation. I had no money for tickets so when a train was moving, I tried to jump on top of the roof and get a little ride and then people were always helping me. When I did get to , it was a terrible disappointment which I could not understand it there, <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> me, I'll take you there and you find out, maybe things will be easier for you. Since I had nothing to lose, I said okay. Not that I knew her before, and the transportation I remember clearly my journey from to . It had to be done by sled. There was no other way of transportation. By then it was January, and it was very, very cold. Sled rides, the people who were running the sleds, that's how they made their living, but they offered to take me without money. But, my legs were all frozen. I didn't have enough warm clothes and they were frozen for about seven, eight years until I got rid of it. Anyway, I get to that city of</p><p> . She took me her home, and she says I'll introduce you to people who might help you and at that time that was the Russian part now.</p><p>Q. Is she a Jewish woman?</p><p>A. Yes.</p><p>Q. And at this point, you had lost all contact with your family?</p><p>A. Well, I had no contact with my mother and sister who were in the German part. I had no contact with my father whom I lost in the woods so I was all alone. So, when I got to that little town of , she right away, a small town, they say, oh there is a little girl who <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0 any further. I see what I can do for you. You come to my office tomorrow morning. And I said, your office, I don't speak Russian. I don't know really nothing. He said don't worry. So, I stayed another night at the household of that woman, and the next morning I got into his office and he said, okay, put me at his desk, wrote the Russian alphabet out for me and says you learn Russian and in the meantime I'll give you a salary. So, it was just unbelievable luck. To make a long story short, I stayed in the city of until the German liquidated the Jews, but that's getting ahead of it.</p><p>Q. Why was he so nice, and how did you know who to trust?</p><p>A. Well, I trusted them as far as when I had no other choices. When I had choices, I did not trust them. Why did I trust him? I had no place to go, so why shouldn't I.</p><p>Q. And he was just a nice man?</p><p>A. He was just a nice man. He introduced me to his wife, to his children, and they were very helpful at their later day in that respect that the Russians were sending out all the people who got into the city of after a certain day to Siberia. She put me on her list of the <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 1 completely shut off from any information. After all, the Germans and the Russians were buddy, buddy at that time. So, I was just all by myself, and I was working and except not knowing and not having a way to know life kind of stabilized for me. I couldn't go to school because that's true, school was free, but board and food and everything else was not. So, I stayed in that town until when Germany invaded the Russian part of Poland after they had that <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 2 of the Germans. Until that June 21, the Germans came very fast, very swift. The second day they were there, they surrounded all man of the little city. It was a get a shovel, get some food for three days. We have to build roads. Almost everybody just signed up, so it became a city of women. All men left and were never heard of again. As I was sitting in my room, there was a very kind lady who said, "Look, the Germans are here. You cannot stay by yourself. You come and live with me." I knew her son. I never met her but I knew her son, and I knew her daughters and I said, "No,I cannot do it. You have --." She said, "I don't want to hear any different." She was a very energetic person. She says, "Come on. Get your possessions." I didn't have much, so it wasn't a problem of sorting what I take, what I leave. I had very little, and she took me to her household. Her name was Mrs. Pollock. She was just the most wonderful, wonderful person that I have ever met in my life, and I met lots of people, and lots of people who are helpful to me, but she was just wonderful. She had lots of contacts through the farmers. She used to put her babushka on and get into the farm and bring some bread and share it with me, like she shared it with her daughters. There was never a difference. She was just great.</p><p>Q. These were Jewish people?</p><p>A. Yes. As I was working, I made contacts with non-Jewish people too, and they were very nice, very helpful, very friendly. Most of the people were always very friendly towards me.</p><p>Q. When you refer to this as a city of women, you're talking about just the Jewish area?</p><p>A. Well, we weren't in the Ghetto yet.</p><p>Q. But the men who were taken away were just Jewish men?</p><p>A. Just Jewish men. Well, I don't remember exactly the period of times we could stay in our homes, then it comes that all Jews go to a Ghetto in . There was no question <span class="page-break" number="11"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 3 for her that I go wherever she goes. So, we had about a week's time I think to find quarters.</p><p>They just gave us a few houses separated them and then all the Jews from spread out towns had to go to a Ghetto. That was my first experience and exposure to a Ghetto.</p><p>Q. About how many people were in this Ghetto?</p><p>A. I would just have to take a rough -- maybe 8,000. I wouldn't want to be quoted on it because I don't know, but it was a small town to begin with, and the Jewish population wasn't that tremendous. There was not an outright anti-semitism felt because it was spread out. So, I really don't know, but I do know that she found quarters. Every family had to find where to live, so she found a house where there were two sisters living and they had two rooms and a kitchen and then she had a mother, Mrs. Pollock. So, it was her mother, myself, her two daughters, and she, we all moved into that two room apartment. Life in Ghetto wasn't terrible because the people who were in charge of the Ghetto had a certain kindness about them and a certain understanding. So, those are Jews in the Ghetto and then there are Germans outside. They have to abide orders in order for the Germans not to storm the Ghetto. But their idea was how to help the Jewish population who was there. So, yes, we did have police and we did have a Judenrot, but they were a part of the Jewish community of the Ghetto, which was not true in other Ghettos.</p><p>We were supplied our food from Wilno, the Wilno Ghetto was our main headquarters, you could say. We stayed in the Ghetto and I found a job for a German commandant of <span class="page-break" number="12"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 4 Q. Was this a sealed off Ghetto?</p><p>A. It wasn't closed. It was sealed off but people were going to work and coming back from work so there was contact. Of course there was a lot of barter, and it wasn't a very strict kind of situation. There was also hunger already creeping in. We had to give all our possession, the gold, furs, whatever the Germans collected that. Somehow, I found amazing through my whole experience, they demanded that they give all your jewels away, and it was hard to part with it so you gave it away. You wouldn't think of flushing it down the toilet or anything like that, but it was yours and you couldn't do it. At that point, we knew that the Wilno Ghetto had a lot of actions, that a lot of people were being killed and taken away and the Judenrot had to submit the people. The Germans never entered the Ghetto. They just gave the Judenrot a list, today I need 100,000 people or 10,000 people, whatever the transfer was. And one day, I remember clearly, the Wilno Judenrot put a request towards , that the Jews of <span class="page-break" number="13"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 5 So, we did get kind of a feeling what was going on in Wilno. Not precisely but one day we got a decree that Ghetto is being liquidated. It's time for to become Q. About when was this?</p><p>A. "42 probably because "43 I was in " Q. Was it liquidated in April "43, does that make sense?</p><p>A. When I got to , 1 thought maybe April "43 yes because I was in Wilno a short time.</p><p>Q. But you're saying in the Ghetto, you really didn't have actions and all sorts of reprisals against the people and roundups?</p><p>A. No, because the Judenrot -- the only roundup was the 400 people.</p><p>Q. So, you felt moderately safe there?</p><p>A. Yes. Kind of life took it's own tone so to say.</p><p>Q. Were there any activities in the Ghetto? Were there schools for the children?</p><p>A. No, it was a small community. If I said 8,000 maybe I exaggerated the amount because there was a lot of people coming in from the neighboring little farms. They were all put into</p><p> , but I made some friends. So, people were going out to work, coming. It was <span class="page-break" number="14"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 6 food away from her children. Not for one second. There were times, before I got my job, that they were saying we need 100 girls to build roads, she would send her daughters instead of me.</p><p>She felt I'm too delicate for it. I mean she was just so terrific.</p><p>Q. And the Jewish police who are guarding the Ghetto, would let people come and go?</p><p>A. Well you had to have permission. It wasn't just free-- because we were not allowed to walk the streets.</p><p>Q. Not even in the Ghetto?</p><p>A. In the Ghetto, yes.</p><p>Q. But you said this woman would go out at night to the farms. Did she sneak out or the people just didn't look?</p><p>A. She sneaked out.</p><p>Q. And if the policeman saw her, they turned the other way?</p><p>A. She made sure nobody sees her.</p><p>Q. When you were working for this German in town, did you learn anything special that you might not have learned otherwise?</p><p>A. No, just the Jewish star.</p><p>Q. You didn't hear them talking about anything?</p><p>A. No. I was treated decent, but I was not a part of -- I very rarely had any contact with the commandant I was working for. That was not my place. I wasn't a member of that family. I was just doing the work, and it did give me an opportunity if I was to go and bring water which was in the next house, we didn't have running water, and then they were friends of mine, the Poles, and I used to sneak into their house, and they used to give me a slice of bread which I could bring back to the Ghetto. So, there was still some contact with the outside world.</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Now, you said you were learning little by little what was happening in Wilno. Did you have any knowledge of what was happening in the camps in Poland?</p><p>A. No, not at that time. So, when they liquidated the Ghetto, what they did is they took the Jews from the Ghetto and send them to a different so <span class="page-break" number="16"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 8 bottom of the truck. We'll put straw over you and then we'll sneak you into Wilno. So, the next morning, early in the morning, I went on the truck, and I went to Wilno. As luck would have it, at that particular time, the German officers were at the gates of the Wilno Ghetto, and they poked the truck and here I come out. So, the Wilno police, who had no idea, kind of whisked me away from them and brought me into the Ghetto and put me into that jail. Somehow I got away from the Germans thanks to their alertness or whatever. So, I was in the jail for about a day and a half, and I was interrogated. Why am I coming here. What do I want here, and so on and on and what am I going to be, and what am I going to live on. There was Jewish police woman and she was from Kovno. She said, "Oh, let her go. I'll take her to my house." So, again, luck was just unbelievably with me. She did take me to her quarters and kind of took me under her wing. She was a sweet young lady. She had a mother and two sisters and a little brother and I certainly was not welcome in their house, because I took another little space away.</p><p>End of Tape 1</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Yes, I do, I did. At that time, because history was repeating itself, the same kind of Germans I saw in Lodz. The same kind of groups were entering the city of 5 <span class="page-break" number="18"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 0 A.

No, it did not free me from thinking about them, but it freed me for independent action. I can move around. I can hide in the doorway or not hide int he doorway. I don't have to worry well if I hide and my little sister and mother are in the room upstairs, I have a certain responsibility, So, yes, I was free. There were a lot of people who had family. I was more lonely, I was more not belonging, but I was freer. And I used that freedom later on in many occasions. Yes, and I probably used it in Ghetto. Would I be with my <span class="page-break" number="20"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 3 was an empty apartment in the building where I was working. So, instead of gig back to the Ghetto, I just crawled under a bed in that apartment. The next day I just crawled out and was back on the job. I couldn't do it if 1 would have obligations towards my family. Would I rather not have a family and have that freedom? No, but that wasn't my choice. At other times there was actions in the Wilno Ghetto, and they were very often. Anyway, it worked. The Germans gave the commandant, was the commandant of the Wilno Ghetto, gave him a list <span class="page-break" number="21"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 4 influential people, and that always helps. There was a lot of it going on. I imagine you could buy out your place on an action. I was a newcomer to Wilno and again, the same policy, let's get rid of the Jews who came later here, who came from the surrounding areas. So, yes, it was a very fearful place to live. There was also a group of people from in Wilno <span class="page-break" number="21"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 5 -- I don't know if I'm going ahead or not-- but anyway, that group set against -- you compile your lists if you believe that that might save any Jews but don't touch us. And they all collected in one building with all their ammunition and it was a known secret to everyone that that place belongs to that so-called underground. It no longer was underground, but that's where they sat and they set the guns if the Germans ever come into that building and touch that house, we let loose. The Germans respected it. They didn't touch it. Well, eventually they did. They had all the time in the world, you know.</p><p>Q. Was this a fairly large group?</p><p>A. I wouldn't think so. Not enough to do more damage to the Germans. I have to die, if you Germans would die, but there was a much larger group that did not want to resist the Germans knowing how hopeless it would be. And I believe against this, and probably other commandants too, that as long as he can keep the Germans out of the Ghetto there is a chance of saving one, two, five, twenty Jews. But was married to a non-Jewish person, and really <span class="page-break" number="22"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 6 group of people, there was a cafe on the corner and the young people used to gather together and sing some songs, until the next episode would take place.</p><p>Q. Were there cultural activities?</p><p>A. Not organized cultural activities, not that I was aware of, and I certainly have no claim of knowing everything that was going on in the Ghetto. I was I imagine a pretty narrow minded person myself, but from what I knew it was rather spirit building. We're still alive, we cannot sit still and think, not the younger people. And if I remember correctly, there was in that little cafe was a I remember the number was 31, the name of the street probably will come back to me, and it kind of lifted your spirit up, because none of us really believed that we are going to survive it.</p><p>So, there were love affairs going on. Whatever normal does in normal circumstances under abnormal circumstances. The ethical standards were not the same. There was no code of ethics.</p><p>There was none of that.</p><p>Q. Why do you say that? What does that mean?</p><p>A. It means that things you would do when you were brought up in nice homes before the war, there were things you wouldn't do. You wouldn't make love so easily.</p><p>Q. What else?</p><p>A. I don't know. Just the whole outlook of did you hear that was taken on an action, this one -- it wasn't as bad as it became later. So, there was still kind of a measure, can I help you, or this one instead of that one justifying witnessing certain actions. That was not normal behavior. So, you tried to keep some feel of sanity knowing that it's not the same as outside. I mean you don't buy your life for money. I mean you don't do that outside. You might very easily do that in Ghetto if you can help it.</p><p>Q. Did you steal from other people, tell on your neighbors?</p><p>This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Sometimes you would do that, yes. It became much more pronounced later on. Ghetto still had some semblance, and I use that word very cautiously, of family life. So, yes, there was a police over you. There were some zealous policemen if you were not supposed to have onions in your house and they found a piece of onion on the floor or a crumb, yes, you would be denounced. You would be punished. Is that normal behavior, you know? So, other ones tried to say-- but there was still some family life. I didn't have one. I belonged no place, but lots of people did.</p><p>Q. You had a social life?</p><p>A. What social life. I was just floating around. I had no roots. I had no responsibilities, and I did not get involved in any underground, so I went to work and said well, what do I do tomorrow. How do I escape the next day or how do I survive the next day. So, it was a very selfish kind of existence.</p><p>Q. What about institutions in the Ghetto, like hospitals or soup kitchens, did that kind of thing exist?</p><p>A. Not in the Wilno Ghetto. Not to my knowledge.</p><p>Q. It didn't have the organization that some of these other Ghettos has?</p><p>A. I don't think. I am not aware of it, and I think I would have been aware of it. Who would support that soup kitchen? There were no supplies coming in. There was no funds.</p><p>Q. What about hunger, disease, things like that?</p><p>A. Yes, hunger was becoming more and more pronounced because as I said it was semi- normal. A lot of products were brought into the Ghetto by the people who did not live in the Ghetto before and there was a lot of bunkers and people were hiding things. But then there were people who just got the normal rations and they were not very big. So, yes, hunger was there.</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Were people sick?</p><p>A. People were sick. People were hungry. People were unhappy, their heads were always down. It was just how do I survive. How do I survive every day living and how do I survive the outside world.</p><p>Q. I'm trying to picture this. If I were looking at the streets of the Wilno Ghetto, not during an action, but just on a day, what would I see?</p><p>A. You would see people milling around and moving around. Just lots of people small quarters. Wilno Ghetto was not tremendous and not necessarily dressed up, and not necessarily friendly and not necessarily -- just different needs and when you would go on the Wilno streets outside the Ghetto, those were lovely streets, lovely people. And you occasionally might see Jews because when the Jews were going to work, they were going through the streets of Wilno, but not on the sidewalks. They all wore stars. They all were being led by someone. So, you did see it, so whoever tells you we didn't know just is lying. You could not not know. So, that's just a cop out and the majority of the population believes this statement. I just read an interesting -- it's not my own quotation, but somebody wrote it ina book. That when you hear today or heard after the war how helpful the outside population was, how many thousand helpful people there were, it is very surprising that even one single Jew was killed.</p><p>Q. Was there much observation of religion in the Ghetto?</p><p>A. Individually, yes. People became a little bit more religious looking for help. There was no help from the outside world, so they were looking for help from God.</p><p>Q. Was this done in families or were there actually prayer houses?</p><p>A. No, families, as far as I know.</p><p>Q. What kind of work did you do when you were living in the Wilno Ghetto?</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. <span class="page-break" number="25"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 9 A. When I was in the Ghetto I was working in a household, cleaning. That was usually a very good job. It was not on the street, it wasn't in a factory, so those were plum jobs.</p><p>Q. How did you get it?</p><p>A. I knew someone who needed ten people because he was in command of and he said, "Hey Bella, I'll put you on that." I said great.</p><p>Q. So you were working for a Lithuanian family, a German family?</p><p>A. I'm trying to remember because | didn't work very much because I had no connections so occasionally I used to get a job. It was a German family.</p><p>Q. How long were you in the Wilno Ghetto?</p><p>A. A few months. Not very long, but I was one of the last ones to leave the Wilno Ghetto.</p><p>Q. How did the end come about, can you tell me?</p><p>A. The end came about when refused the last remnants of the Jews. <span class="page-break" number="26"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0 working, and before it was beautiful organized mechanized, they used to get people from the Ghetto. They had a transport bring them to the forest of Pornaty. Those dug their own graves and then they had to line up and were killed there. All of a sudden the Germans found an enemy.</p><p>Not from the dead or the living, but the whole grounds lifted up. They could not absorb all that blood and whatever, so those thing had to be dug out. Those were the Jews from the Ghetto were brought in, dug out the graves and put some petroleum and burned it. We were fully aware of what Pornaty was.</p><p>Q. As people came back?</p><p>A. Some of them snuck out. Some of them were killed, stayed there in the grave for two days until they dug themselves out until they got back home, the Ghetto. So, at that point we were fully aware that there is only one way for the Jews, that's gas chambers. And that was after the conference, after the solution of how to take care of the Jews. So, there really is <span class="page-break" number="27"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 1 off they went and new trains came and off they went, and we just stayed there. Then we were put on a truck and that was my last view of the population of Wilno.</p><p>Q. How many people were with you?</p><p>A. 200 out of 2,000, 4,000. Why me? I don't know. We didn't know where we were going, but you were just going. Whatever he said, left or right, that's where you went. You were brought in on that truck and then after a while we were loaded into a cattle car and the doors closed and we were just taking off. We had no idea where we were going. The doors never opened. We weren't fed. The situation in the cars was horrible. People became just wild. No air, no food, little human dignity left. You know, two or three days -- once they stopped the cars and brought some buckets of water in, and that probably was a bigger disaster than not having water. I don't know, because the worst element of your personality was coming throughout.</p><p>After about three days, I would guess, of that voyage, the doors opened up and everybody _, . , SO you just jump out of the cars and I was faced, and the rest of the people with me was faced with a group of German soldiers with bayonets and some kind of a forest. Now, my thought was knowing what happened in Pornaty, that that's the end of it. Now, they're just going to get rid of us. They didn't. After everybody was out, we all of a sudden see some people in striped uniforms, and they speak Jewish and they say don't worry you're</p><p> .

They could do whatever they pleased. Power thirsty and just brutes, real honest to goodness brutes.</p><p>Q. In what way?</p><p>A. Abusive, beating, snap command because they were dealing with vermin, not human beings anymore. They were just outright criminals. The guy that was in charge of the camp, Mr.</p><p>Ickes, was there for killing his wife and her boyfriend. There were other ones. Some of them were political prisoners. They were nicer. The difference with them was they were all wearing little triangles, the black triangles designated one crime. Then we had the commandant who was a German SS. We had some German SS supervising some internal functions of .</p><p>And then we had some Jewish supervisors supervised by German guards who were working outside the camp. really was not a camp, it was a collection camp. They used to bring Jews from Germany. It was an interesting place when you learned later about geography and happenings. was a very important place. The Germans did not do their killing on German grounds. They exported the Jews and the minute they left the borders of Germany, they no longer were German citizens and they just joined the of <span class="page-break" number="30"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 4 uniforms for uniforms. It was part of the big who used to get all the suitcases if you equivalent to the Auschwitz commando. It was equivalent in the way of work. All the Germans used to be brought in Czechs who came by car and suitcases and under pretense of paradise, all their baggage was taken away and was sent to and we used to sort the things. Put valuables separate, ladies clothes, furs, and you know when you go on a voyage and leave everything behind, you take the very best with you. So, the people in Germany had a hey day because all those things were taken by the Germans and sent to their wives, their lovers, their whatever. So, anyway, that was the assignment I had among other people.</p><p>Q. So, in doing this, how did it feel. Sort of strange going through other people's lives in a way?</p><p>A. Yes, very strange. Heartbreaking, if you had a heart left. When I say there were different standards of viewing life, that was one of them. What pride. There was only the strongest who tried to keep on resemblance of a human being because the Germans did everything possible to destroy it in you and then you are .

Well, I would say I was privileged. I didn't have to go outside the camp. I stayed in camp. My job was pretty protected. The weather did not affect me. I could be choosy in some articles of clothes, I had either access to it. Oh, yes, I think it was a privileged job.</p><p>Q. When you say you had easy access to certain pieces of clothing, what did you do with them?</p><p>A. You steal them, and you use them or you sell them. I did not sell them. It wasn't something that I wanted or needed, but occasionally I would see a sweater that was pretty so I could put it on, and the people who didn't have access to it, could not.</p><p>Q. But didn't you have to have this uniform? How could you have this sweater?</p><p>A. You wore it underneath or you know, and since I was working inside, that's part of the privilege.</p><p>Q. What about trading these clothes for extra food?</p><p>A. Lots of people did that. When they had access to it, lots of people did that. It was just an instinct in some people. I never needed very much, so I had no need to do it, or desire, or was too scared. I might have just been scared.</p><p>Q. Now, in working in this , you probably had a good idea of transports <span class="page-break" number="33"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 7 Q. Where were these transports coming from?</p><p>A. Mostly Germany, Hungary, Czechoslovakia. As time progressed and more and more Jews were sent out from Europe, that's where they were coming from. And there was a little sleepy station, a , and God is that clear in my mind, all those SS standing there when the doors opened and those hundreds of people giving out and I did visit that place after the war and it was just mind boggling. Peaceful, quiet, what Jews, what transports, what Hitler, what Germans, none of that.</p><p>Q. Were there children at ?</p><p>A. There were transports coming in with children. The children were not very long there.</p><p>They were sent out.</p><p>Q. Was there any resistance?</p><p>A. In , no I don't think so. Not in . What was happening to me personally let's say in , | found since we no longer have any home life, any home things, that we were just individuals bonding and developing of new families was fabulous.

Just sitting on the wooden planks talking. There was no entertainment. There was no stimulation of -- there was nothing to feed your mind or expand it or look what happens outside.</p><p>We were completely cut off from the outside. There was no communication. So, you just bonded with yourself, trying to remember, keep strong, that's not what you're going to become if you ever survive. That was my thinking. Now, that's not the way to behave. All those little things. There was nothing to feed our minds and develop us. Some Ghettos had schools and what not. Concentration camps did not. My concentration camp did not.</p><p>Q. What did you dream about?</p><p>A. In camp, I imagine freedom. That was a farfetched dream. I know what I'm dreaming of now, it's concentration camp.</p><p>Q. When you were in camps, did you think about what you would do if you got out?</p><p>A. As a profession?</p><p>Q. Just your life?</p><p>A. I didn't know what I'd do with my life, but I knew I was not going to carry my education from concentration outside concentration camp. I'm not going to slam my fist and say you owe me. If I want to become a part of society and evidently if I want freedom, that's what I want, that I will have to adjust and nobody else is going to adjust to me.</p><p>Q. You thought this at the time?</p><p>A. Yes. And that was my firm conviction. Maybe that's what you are talking about.</p><p>Q.

There wasn't so many in , So it couldn't be too tremendous. But my husband built :</p><p> Q. Your husband now?</p><p> A. No.</p><p>Q. Your former husband?</p><p>A. Yes. He built , So he was an excellent architect, so he built it well.</p><p>There was a lot of stealing of material from the outside so we had washrooms, which is just not the usual feature of the concentration camp. So, that's why I say was not the worst. Once you survived, once you're there, once you worked, it was not worst. We used to take walks. I remember my girlfriend and I we were 17 or 18 and we walked for hours around, around, and around talking about our families. I had a sister and I had mother and I had a this and how was it.

You go to work, boy meets girls, you know you don't have much to live. You get acquainted. These kinds of things. I think that's the hardest part for people who are not in camp to understand it, but it was a part of social life, if you wish. The encounters were very brief. You just looked through the barbed wire and waved, you know, that kind of thing.</p><p>Q. Were people able to have sexual relationships in camp?</p><p>A. I don't think so, but I'm sure too that was done. I would not like to put it that kind of thing, life wasn't so bad, no it wasn't that way.</p><p>Q. How long were you in ?</p><p>A.

My girlfriend was. In the meantime, just as a side story, one night I get a message it said Mrs. Pollock is in Studthoff and would I need her help. Those were the wire fences and that was all electrically fed and so on. I sneaked out at night to that fence and on the other side is that woman, and then she says to me, "Bella, catch." And she throws me her ration of bread. She says I am going to the gas chamber. You still have achance. And just disappeared in the night. That was the last time I ever saw her. That's the kind of a person she was. Going back to . Somehow my husband managed -- Q. Your future husband?</p><p>A. No, my first husband.</p><p>Q. But you weren't married yet?</p><p>A.

We were a part of Buchenwald and there was an ammunition factory, and that's where they needed some labor. They sent them the front, they needed people to produce work, so they just took some from Studthoff and that's where we got to and worked in an ammunition factory. It was not the normal <span class="page-break" number="41"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 7 atmosphere. And then we used to go work in the factory, you did mingle with the Germans because you all were involved in producing ammunition. We were just additional help. So, you could move around. It wasn't that tight supervision by SS. That lasted until January "45 when the first wave of American bombers attacked and three quarters of the city was bombed and fire and there was no work because the factory was not destroyed. It was very careful bombing. The camp was not attacked. The factory was not attacked. Three quarters of the city was in rubble. We were used to go out and help clean the city. That was the assignment.</p><p>As a matter of fact, we never worked again in that factory because if the factory was almost ready to be workable, one plane came and dropped one bomb on the water supply and just got the factory out of circulation.</p><p>Q. So you were out on the streets?</p><p>A. Well, there's more going out on the streets, cleaning the rubble and cleaning up the street and waiting until we can go back to work and continue. So far they did not send us back to Buchenwald because they did expect to have the factory working again. They never did. And what would you like to know next?

I personally did not.</p><p>Q. So, what were you doing at this point?</p><p>A. Mostly we were sometimes sitting in the barracks and waiting.

He said well the Germans left that establishment last night and I found a wonderful desk which I'd like to take home, but my wagon broke, so if you're not in a terrible hurry could you help me carry that. I will give you something. I don't have much, but a little sugar if you help me carry that desk. Hey, sure. We didn't tell him who we are, and he did not suspect.</p><p>Q. You weren't wearing your camp uniforms?</p><p>A. We no longer had --what we had striped clothes like that and I had a kerchief. My husband had a regular suit which he prepared, and my girlfriend had a kerchief. We spoke fluent German. When he took us to his bombed out house, we helped him carry the desk he wanted, and we started talking a while and my husband and my friend said to him, hey there are so many other good things there. He said yes but how am I going to carry them. He said, okay we don't care. We'll stay here a night and help you tomorrow and it developed into a two week stay at his house. Things were a little touchy because he had a girlfriend who had a niece and she socialized with the German soldiers, and they came at night to visit, so we had conversations and they told me why don't I come to their barracks, they had food left over.

They had a concentration camp, but they were the fighting troops. They were still fighting the war. The war was not over. They put us on ajeep. Found us a place, you know lots of Nazis left town, established, brought us a house and then were bringing us everything which there kitchen had. Every two minutes a truck load of food came on the table. I mean just talk about unbelievable happiness, and that's just a side story because when we were brought into that house with all that food, I remember what I said to myself. If you're ever liberated, you're going to be a human being right from minute one. So, I asked the American soldiers to give me a white table cloth and some dishes. The three of them were ready to kill me.</p><p>They were starved and I said, no. And then we set the table and had some candles and had our first meal as liberated people.</p><p>Q. With your dignity in tact?</p><p>A. Right. And that's how we were liberated.</p><p>Q. How long were you at this place before you felt free -- were you free at this point to just move around and do what you wanted?</p><p>A. We could, but we didn't. It was very shaky, very uncomfortable. But then we got used to it. We got a nicer house and we contacted lots of people who were liberated different ways and we had party. So, we were free. We really were free. There were no Germans and we were under the American occupation.</p><p>End of Tape 3 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Then we went to town to and found out other people who survived different ways, they kind of congregated more in two or three houses in the center of the city. So, we didn't see too much of them, but we knew of them and stayed there until the rumors headed that the Russians were coming. I think that was the sequence of the events. And no way would we stay under the Russian occupation. So, we just stepped left of and again towards the American zone, Frankfurt.

There was nothing.</p><p>Q. And you hadn't thought about going back to Poland?</p><p>A. Not me.</p><p>Q. So you went to Salsheim?</p><p>A. I went to Salsheim. I got a job in the office and we did register people who were looking for relatives and now the next thought is what are you going to do with the rest of your life. You don't want to stay in Germany. We knew that we wanted to go to the United States. There was a very strong push of having displaced persons go to Palestine and there were a lot of single displaced persons and a lot of them did go to Palestine. So, I had a house in Salsheim and we lived there. I worked in an office.</p><p>Q. What were the conditions like in the camp, in Salsheim?</p><p>A. Barrack life.</p><p>Q.

I didn't know she was alive or not, but she had her sister must be alive, so she left. Mother, who had a boyfriend at that time in Poland, and ventured out to dp camps to find her sister. And one day I walk in Salsheim on the premise of the camp and, what I was doing was going to camp to get some hot water because I had a beauty parlor appointment. You had to bring your hot water with you. And I didn't have the facilities at home so that's where I was going, and passing a group of friend stopped me, and I chatted for a few minutes and then they say hey before you take off, how about saying hello to your sister. I looked at her. She looks at me. It was five years since I didn't see her. So, from a little girl she grew up. So, that's how she found me. So, I didn't go to the beauty parlor. I went back home and I said to my husband, "Hey, you married a girl without a family, here she is." Now, he was fully aware of her because I spoke an awful lot about her.</p><p>Q. And she told you that your mother was still alive?</p><p>A. Yes.</p><p>Q. What happened to your father?</p><p> A. My father was killed.</p><p>Q. Nobody every saw him again.

For the other people. It was kind of American -- uniform.</p><p>Q. When you arrived, do you remember your first impressions?</p><p>A. Yes. My husband had a cousin here whom he didn't know who met him at the boat and took us to their house. They were lovely people and kind and good, and we stayed there for a little while. My husband had a sister in Peoria so naturally that is where we were going, my husband and my sister and I. We got to Peoria. She had just lost her husband and there really wasn't very much for us to do unfortunately. We didn't speak English. Their community was very willing. They were so happy to finally have refugees and do something for them, they were willing to give us money. Well, money we did not want. We wanted to learn English, get a job and so on. That was very tough because let's face it, I had no qualifications. They finally got me a job in a sewing factory. Princess Peggy's they used to make frocks or something like that. I worked there for a whole two weeks, but at the end of day every day, the girl who supervised the work, came over ripped out what I did, because I didn't know how to use a sewing machine. So, if you have to put fancy things on it, you know, the material went and the other part went. I really could never master that art. I didn't know how to speak English, and I was very unhappy there. Then my mother was coming to the States, so my husband says okay, I go to New York and pick up your mother and you stay here. That's what he did. Then he told me he's not going back to Peoria. I said fine, I am coming to New York. So, we left Peoria behind and got back to New York.</p><p>Q. What were your first impressions when you came to the United States?</p><p>A. As far as people?</p><p>Q. Was it some sort of a culture shock at all?</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

No. I remember my first ride in Central Park, and when I looked at the tall buildings and each building had a light in the window and I said to myself, there is a family living every place behind that light. That was very impressive. Life was not very easy to get adjusted and make a living here.</p><p>Q. What do you think gave you the strength and the courage to get through all of this the way you did?</p><p>A. I really could not answer that question, I don't know. I just thought that's the way I should behave.</p><p>Q. Did you think you would get through it?</p><p>A. No, but did I really give up hope completely? Probably not.</p><p>Q. Is there anything that you can think of that kept you going?</p><p>A. No, honestly I don't think it's a desire I have to survive to let the world know, I didn't think so. I don't think that's what kept me going. I think it was selfish reason to survive and to live.</p><p>Q.

That's my observation, my explanation of it. So men when they lost their pride, they became nothing. There was no support group, whereas lots of women did find support groups somehow. Even the term was different, but just that whole idea of you have to be clean, you have to fight a little, you have to you know, and here is a little girl who needs help and so yes it depends on the woman. It just isn't a flat rule going for all womanhood, but it was a certain trend of doing that. On the other hand, I saw women who went very willingly on the bus train, whatever, car load, if their child was taken away from them. They didn't have to. I didn't see men doing it. That doesn't mean they didn't, but I didn't see it.</p><p>Q. What about the way you were treated? Were you treated differently by the guards?</p><p>A. In certain respect for women? No.</p><p>Q. Or disrespect?</p><p>A. No.</p><p>Q. Was there an opportunity to women to use their sex to get favors?</p><p>A. Sometimes. I don't think there was the same opportunity for men because whatever they presented would not be very attractive to the SS women that have everything. There were opportunities.</p><p>Q. And that happened?</p><p>A. I'm sure.</p><p>Q. This wasn't a first hand experience of yours?</p><p>A. My first experience, no, but I know that it happened. I don't like to prove my point by names and what not and having opinions about it or judgment.</p><p>This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

I'm just curious as to whether it went on and whether people were able to use that to their advantage?</p><p>A. Sometimes they did and sometimes people did and could not. And it wasn't always possible. There were times that it was possible. The will to life was very strong.</p><p>Q. When you talk about the bonding between women, the relationships that were formed that really helped sustain you, were some of those relationship sexual as well?</p><p>A. No, not that I know. It's not fair for me to say. Not that I know. Just loving someone and everytime I think of my girlfriend who stayed behind in Studthoff and lost her life --.</p><p>Q. When you think back, and I'm sure you think back often, what images stick with you the most? What haunts you the most.</p><p>A. What hurts me the most I imagine the images of seeing people loaded on trains to destination destruction and murder. I think that's probably -- the rest kind of disappears. So there was hunger so people were dead. That hurts the most. There was just no way out of it except luck.</p><p>Q. What sort of long term impact do you think this has had on you and on your life?</p><p>A. Long term impact? Nightmares, waking up in sweat and fear until you realize there is nothing to fear. There are no trucks and SS and barracks and chambers and what not. I think nightmares and thinking of all the ones who are no longer here. It's not guilt. I did not trade their places and vice versus. It's just they were not as lucky as I was. Most of it is luck. It wasn't the armies helping to liberate the inmates of concentration camps and all of that. There was no country who really reached out to help us. So, it was luck, mostly, and if you call being at the right place at the right time, that's a part of luck, so I don't know really why I am alive and somebody isn't, but that is what the greatest impact is.

And it should just make people aware that that can happen to any group of people by other people. Then the Jewish holocaust wouldn't be unique, theirs would be unique. It still would be unique, but what I'm saying is remember hatred does not justify that kind of human attitude. And how do we teach people not to hate? I don't know.</p><p>Q.
