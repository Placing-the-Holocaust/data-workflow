<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: If you would please tell me your name, where you were born, when you were born?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My name is Solomon Rodashinksy. I was born and raised in Poland, in Warsaw. My birthday is May 17, 1910. All my life I was in Warsaw, the whole family. I come from eight people, six children, three girls and three boys and my father and my mother and the rest of the family, my fathet's side was six brothers and three sisters. My mother's was two sisters and three brothers, so we had a big family. Over there, I figured out after the war how many people is alive, I never find it to now nobody. I was looking in papers, conventions, I was going in 1981 and in 1993 the Washington D.C. and then in 1985 in Philadelphia. There was a convention I ever missed, I advertised through the radio, through the television, through the . Still now I get some papers from the</p><p> , they ask me to find somebody and until now I never saw a person pointing their finger saying I know you. There was 78 people including nieces, nephews, all of the family, and I'm the one alive. I ask myself many times why, why am I alive? But, maybe God leave it me to be alive to sometime say the way I am and what I am and that's it.</p><p>Then in 1940 Yom Kippur day, it comes out they're going to make a ghetto and that ghetto don't take too long from Yom Kippur to November 15, everybody had to come out and where to find a room. It was very hard. Some people never let in, but later on they did it because the Jewish section around Warsaw was atound and we found a room of less in</p><p> , the street. But there was on the one room, six people, my mother, my father, three sisters and I who were the six. I think one of my brothers there. We sleep on the floor and the winter time -- and Europe's winter time is not like here, a little day like yesterday morning you say oh it's cold. I say it's cold too, because I'm already 45 years here in the United States, but the life was very, very hard. Until they come into the ghetto.</p><p>The ghetto was so terrible, people were laying in the streets. Mostly the people were coming around from around the small towns behind Balsa. The Germans throw out and make it the third . The third means any people can't live around in this town, the third . People with little children, they're in the street every morning we saw the dead in the corner. When the Jewish commander ; that means people would come and pick up the dead people in little hand trailers and bring that to the cemetery and the cemetery had no place. They made big, big holes and they put in 100 to 200 people and they covered it. No food. So, when I'm talking about, I see the picture from my eyes what happened there. There was a young guy, his name was Rubinstein. He was no crazy, he made it crazy. He was running around in the streets, I have to say a few words in Yiddish what he said _ that means we're all the same <span class="page-break" number="0"></span> helped those poor people in the street. This was not help too, of course. There come a time 1942, July 22, the about 2 o'clock signs in the street who wants to go to work and get two bread. Our bread at that time, our bread is not like you got it here, a pint, a bread is a kilo. A kilo is close to two and half pounds. People pushed one into the other one.</p><p>Everybody like to be the first to get the bread. The first transport as 20,000 people. They don't know where they're going. Nobody don't know but the president and the Jewish commander his name was . He hid a man. a Pollock and he paid him <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> they used no water, there was nothing to cook so there was no water. It should have gone through the drains and canals in the street to the other side and bringing in bottles with gasoline, and we make bombs. Fill a bottle with gasoline and cover it with a piece of rag that's coming out and light and throw and this was a bomb.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you involved with this?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> Ag No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But you knew about it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I know that, but I would have been but I know that. Not everybody was to know that, but I know that. I was even maybe three kilometers, three kilometers is over two miles because my shop was in a different street and as so we got organized from bombs, ammunition, hand orenades. rifles. vou know. and the time was coming. I was a . The <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> before, demolished, half from the bombs. See nobody in that time we killed all but two hundred soldiers inside. The Jews started the uprising April 19 and I was there because I was not going back. Hundreds were probably killed but the Germans saw that we be strong, but one thing we never got, we didn't have no airplanes or they're throwing out higher bombs.</p><p>They got that. They started throwing out the bombs with the fire bombs and this was about six weeks we were fighting. May 1st was quiet in the morning and I was going out taking a look and I got a shot in my right ankle. See my right ankle, I got the shot right there, through here. One German saw me I fall down. He was coming with the rifle. He hollered stand up and I had to stand up , they bring me to the , you know what the is? No more now. I come to <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0305 SS where to find the bombs, where there were houses, and where the railroad tracks and everything, not even two weeks, and they fight us, they fight six weeks. Then the history and the war, the six weeks they give up many, I was in Balsa two years ago and I seen in</p><p> a tombstone but it stood where he used to live Street. My wife used to live on that street. I saw that tombstone, and it is written in Hebrew and in Jewish and in Polish, his name. My wife used to know the man.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did you know where to hide? Where did you hide?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Like I say before, I was lucky. All my family dead, I'm the one alive. There were many people that survived the . There was no place to go. We go into the bunkers. There were many bunkers. There were bunkers made onto the ground. From one street to the other one for two miles and the Germans found them out and they destroyed the bunkers with the people. We can never find the people later. It was to 20 <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> saw nobody was there. Even was a lot of children was too. In Europe the houses are not like here. The houses are built in the ground a cellar and then build up the houses and we put together a few cellars and we hid over there a woman which worked in the shop with children. On the other side, we put in some water to see when the commandant says something is broken from the pipes, water on it because you cannot get a plumber. But somebody who had a big mouth said on the other side there is a woman and children. We'd like to find it out and we can never find it out who did it there. Who did it there we just think it was the police.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The Jewish police?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's right. The police had a big mouth and that did it and those Germans knocked off that wall and there were people who were going out -- they had to close the water and they got wet and it was a very frozen day, and snow and they have to go through the water and walk throuch the 1 think manv. manv was fall down there and it was a far wav <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> shop or work at night they come down in the morning, six o'clock, six thirty in the morning I got back in my room, sleep until 3:00, 4:00 in the evening.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I'm a little confused because you say when you first went into the ghetto you lived with your family and there were many people in one room?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. They started the ghetto. This was in 1940. At that time there were no shops. In 1941, "42 they organized the shops, before they opened the shops we were scared to walk in the streets because they grabbed people in the street and some of them never came home. To clean the snow from the railroad tracks, work in the street, this started this was later. This started in 1942 when Treblinka opened up.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did people get chosen for work?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well not everybody can get work. You have to be -- when you say you're a tailor you have to be a tailor. There was a tailor shop too. There was in the same street, but our shop was the furrier shop was a big university, a big building they make a tailor shop. When somebody registered a tailor is going in and working and he didn't know how to do something. He never come out, why he never come out was a man, a German. His name was &gt; and he was coming mostly at night. He was coming and checking, not in the day. When somebody don't know how to work was working at night because the production was made in the day that people that were really tailors that know how to do it. I'm a tailor you know I work in the day and somebody's not, I make the production for him, for the man to be alive.</p><p>And that , he used to come at night and he was I don't know how to call this man this, this man was a monster. You see, the material goes on the table laid down there about this high, maybe higher and they put it on a stencil and chalked around with chalk, where the sleeves, where the front, where the back and took hold of that. Usually you got electric scissors and cut it through there. There they got the knives. Put it on their knives and cut it straight in the chalk and cut it all through the material. That's very hard to do. That</p><p> used to have knives with him he took it and he used to know who was <span class="page-break" number="6"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The Jewish consul there is nothing to say because nothing can help them. They're getting no help. Where can they get help. They never used to get help from nobody. They never used to get it. The people themselves had to help them. Like I said before, we risked our lives and we saw a common end in the ghetto. We asked them, you got a bread, you got a potato, come on I'll get you something. He say, what, I'd say I got pants, I got shoes, we give up our shirts, give up everything, give away, because we got some money but they didn't want no money. They got a lot of money before when the Germans occupied Germans in 1939, they robbed all the stores and there were some very beautiful stores, shoes, suits, ladies dresses everything, sections. They robbed right away. They come in the shop with the Germans, you there. he vot this and this. Streets. _ all of those business. nice <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> recognize your work. I wrote down I can look down inside the lining, what kind of lining it was and I take the paper with the pencil and I wrote down that the lining is made so on and so on to look nice. He brings it in, and I said this is not mine. This is not mine. He said it's yours. I said it's not mine. You told me to write down to give you how it was made and now I got the paper and look if that's the same thing or not. Well, he started to beat me again. He said I want 500 slotas. I said I don't have it with me. I can bring it tomorrow. He said if you don't bring me tomorrow you're going to be dead. I'm coming out and I'll arrest you and you'll be dead. I said okay, but give me a pass to pass the gate when the Germans stand. He write me down, he said 12:00 you be here then I will wait outside by the gate for you. It was a nice day and I will bring you 500 slotas and that's how I was free.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So this policeman was a Jewish policeman?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, Polish. The Jewish policemen were inside in the ghetto. There was a big man. I'll never foroet him. Mv oot killed throuch a Jewish policeman. 1942 in April he's cone <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> 0</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The Judenrot did nothing but for themselves. If they got us something, they took away for themselves. That's all. They never helped nothing. I don't know from where they get the help, from where they get the help. The United States never helped nothing. The other consulates, which consulate can help there, but not the United States.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I read that in the Warsaw Ghetto, at least in the beginning there was a lot of activity. There was a lot of schools and concerts?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What else can you tell me about life in the Warsaw Ghetto?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: What I can tell you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Every day life, what you did?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: What I did, the same thing. We just hoped to be at the end to get out of there. We were thinking, every day it just got worse and worse and worse until it comes the end. The end was to get out of the ghetto. 1943, April 19 when it was the Warsaw ghetto uprising. That was the end.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Before that was there regular selections or deportations?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: This was something everybody was hiding, not to go and get caught. Somebody get caught and they're never coming back. I thought yesterday , he showed me a number which is close to mine. I got a number 128,232 he got 128,203, you know very short, but I asked him when you got the number. He told me he was coming one day before the Auschwitz, and from where, he was in 1940. In 1940 they grabbed him on the street. They grabbed people on the street like they sometimes come and get dogs on the street. Someday like that and they send him away. He told me where he was. He was a hundred times dead and he was coming out and then he was coming the same time the Auschwitz driver was coming,</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were there class distinctions? Did some people live better than others in the ghetto?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. L used to have a home with three bedrooms. Three bedrooms is a six room house. That I have to give up five rooms for people. And you can imagine how they live in the ghetto when I've got a house with six rooms and I have to give up five rooms for people, and people bringing in their own people and they lay in the street and then they take our bed and change their clothes. The life was very, very terrible for us.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was your house, your house before the wat was in the area where the ghetto was?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, no. I had to give up the house and go into the ghetto. Give up the house and give up everything, not even the old clothes I had. I left them. I used to have a gi watched my daughter two years ago and see them in Poland and I saw what the Pollocks robbed a mahoeanv desk and I told her see I used to have a like that. I used <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> 2</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was good off. I used to have a Polish girl in the house when the Germans were coming in and she was going down the , ayoung girl, very beautiful, and talked to her and she said she worked for a Jew and she knew where they are hiding some in the cellar. She bring them in and they come in with the truck and they took out everything and I had to run away. I ran eight kilometers. I stayed there for three days and then I was coming back. I was lucky that I got a shot when I was running. The bombs the bullets everything falling. See, there was nobody to trust. Nobody to trust, especially you thought them to be the police they want to show off who they are. This was the trouble. Maybe it would be a little better. Maybe it would be better to get something more to eat, but of course the Pollocks were coming in and they wanted to help, only they wanted something. They were robbed themselves. When we go out after the -- the 19th of April I saw there's nobody there from our family and then I was coming from concentration camp. I was coming from Maidonek with my leg and I got a bed, I laid down I see a man comes over to me and asks me the way I came. He saw the limp and I showed him my leg and I told him he said I can help you but I cannot help you with no medication. I said well, first do what you can. First I am a doctor, and he took it out a little pocket knife. He took it out and he operated on the leg there. I was lucky they give me a shot, it was a long time, he said this is going to help you and he helped me cut it up and make bandages but I had no medicine, no medication nothing. But I say I can do it. Help yourself, I said what can I help myself, excuse me the next person sav vou and that's coins to help vou. The next mornine we vo <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> 3 dirty work, but to be nine weeks not to have my shirt to change, not to get a bath, nothing.</p><p>Excuse me for my expression but the lice, it was terrible. Not just from me, we had 1,500 people in that barrack all of the same. Until when I was out on the 22nd of July he come, an SS man and took it out three groups 750 people, where are we going, we don't know. We were glad to get out of Maidonek. Maidonek was the worse concentration camp there ever was, and Maidonek is in history the worst concentration camp. They were talking yesterday, about Auschwitz and Birkenau, I didn't want to say nothing. Many people know that. It was written one time in the papers, in a magazine how Maidonek was the worst concentration camp in the history.</p></p></dialogue>

Turn around and we gathered the ropes. The rope was hooked in and to kick away the bench and the first three to be hanged. I muddle by and he hollered, the officer hollered halt, halt, that means stop. HE comes over and says what is that. Smoking a cigarette and they want to say we're hanging dogs.
