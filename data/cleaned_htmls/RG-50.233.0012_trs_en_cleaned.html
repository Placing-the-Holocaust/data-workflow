<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay, just after he became chancellor?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, yes. I know the whole family left Heidelberg at that time. I myself went first to Switzerland, to Basel where we had some relatives and friends that took me up. Where the others went, I really don't know. But for about three months, I didn't know where they were. My father found a place in Holland where he could go to and he even opened a practice in Holland but it was undercover because he did not have the doctor's license in Holland. So it was undercover in Holland.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Your father said no more, we're going to leave Heidelberg and everyone split up?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, yes. I don't know where my sisters went.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But they told you, you're going to Switzerland?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was in Switzerland and I don't know where the others went. We were reunited in Holland in about May of 1933. Was it three months? Maybe March.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: April, maybe. I don't really know for sure but I was prepared in Holland for my bar mitzvah. That's right, it was May and I had to prepare for the bar mitzvah in two and a half months. It was very difficult. I really didn't know much about the Jews at all but I'm circumsised and I didn't know any further. The people, the rabbi in Holland who taught me, I don't really remember him at all. He prepared me for the bar mitzvah. I was bar mitzvahed in August 1933.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Where in Holland were you?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was this a Jew, do you know?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The boarder was not, no. He was very strongly not Jewish at all. Andrew von Ameron. I heard of him later. He was not a Jew at all but anyway, I was bar mitzvahed. A little bit later 1 went to Hachshara which prepared people for Israel with a different instruction such as for instance, I did cabinet making.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's when you were leaving to go to France?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's when later on I left France. I saw the International Exposition in France which was starting in 1936 to 1937. I was much more impressed by the Germans at that time, cast a one-meter block of steel. That is a difficult thing to do. A one- meter square, cube, a one-meter cube, block of steel. Now that's a difficult thing to do. They did this and I saw this. They had everything, the Germans had everything at that time. Well, when I came to France, I just didn't have very much to offer the people. I worked in a couple of shops. One was the piano factory, Pleyel, and I worked in several places.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Here you were tapping your skills as a cabinetmaker?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. I worked as a cabinetmaker in Pleyel and I made radio enclosures which at the time were made of wood and very fancy.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: This was at another factory?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no it was the same factory Pleyel, yes. We also made the composites of upper deck of the pianos and all those things. I did those at Pleyel. After a while I got sick and tired of that, I enlisted in the French army. That was 1939 and I enlisted September and got called up in October, 1939.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you enlist because of the war? The war had begun already in Poland?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yes. The war had begun in France too in September 1. I enlisted in the French army in October or November. Anyway I got assigned to the artillery in Orleans and I remember my father came to Orleans and I had to ---. He took me out and gave me all of the things that they would like, the grown-up persons and I didn't like at all. Like how do you call these mussels that you eat?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Escargot?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, the mussels, escargot are snails. I hate them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oysters?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oysters, oysters! He gave me oysters and champagne.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Your father brought this for you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My father invited me to eat oysters and champagne in Orleans and I couldn't eat that. I could not eat that.</p></p></dialogue>

I was a lot thinner at that time too.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was your basic training in Orleans?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The basic training was, no the basic training was -- we were shipped from Orleans to some other place. We went into the Maginot Line, and were trained there.</p><p>After I enlisted in Orleans and I guess we were educated in military manners in Orleans, then we were shipped to the Maginot Line. Then I drove a car that was absolutely 1919, unbelievable with its handles, unbelievable. It was 1917 I think, it was unbelievable. I said I drove a car to the instructor, I said I drove a car. But that car I could not drive.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: He was looking for somebody to drive?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's right, that's right. I tried and I tried and I could not so I was shipped to the Maginot Line anyway.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: If you could have driven the car, you would have stayed in Orleans for some time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no. I would have been in the Maginot Line to drive that thing. That was when I did that. Later on, it was a much better car, I had a transporter that get munitions to the line. That I could drive, that I could drive.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I guess it was a newer model?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Was a newer model, correct. They also taught us 175 gun. Yes, 75 mm gun, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember the feeling at that time? Did those with you in the army feel that there is going to be a war with Germany? That is a physical war with Germany?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: There was a physical war with Germany. You're mistaken.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Of these 175 mm guns?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Seventy-five mm guns. I was in charge of four of those. I don't know how but I shot until there was no more munitions and that was the end of it. There were no more officers, there were no people around to instruct us this, to instruct us that.</p><p>Once we got rid of our guns after a while, the Germans were very close at that time. I mean with a 75 mm you shot up to about those hills over there. That's how we did it. We shot at them, I learned how to do that. Then we were out of munitions, no more officers, nobody else.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So we're in May 1940?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The officers left or were captured?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't know. The officers apparently left. As my brother gave me an account of that time, is that the officers had cars and they left in cars. We didn't know what to do. We were left alone. A few days before the Germans arrived really. I got out and put my identification which I had -- which was at that time, I was then called Kurt Braunschweig. That was the German name, Kurt Braunschweig.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That was the name you were born with?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's the born name I was born under, Kurt Braunschweig. When I saw that the Germans are going to come, I better get rid of my military identification and changed the name to Brunswic. There comes the name Brunswic.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You just didn't want them to know that you were --?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well of course not. These are our mortal enemies. It was very difficult to keep up the time anyway in captivity too.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So shortly before, you took your ID and revised the name on it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no. I buried it.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Thad nothing. I had absolutely nothing. I know that the Germans they drove the people in front of them.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Describe to me the capture, how you were captured.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well they drove us all together in one big place. The soldiers are on one side and the civilians are on another side. They did separate us. I still had my soldier's uniform at that time. Well, I was a French soldier at that time and was taken prisoner as a soldier.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How long did you actually hold the line? How long did you actually fight before you were overrun by the Germans?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was about two days, 2 2 days until we learned how to get the thing going.</p><p>There were four guys that got the ammunition. We had 80 rounds, how long does that take for a 75 mm gun?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Probably not long?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not long at all. I took maybe an hour. That was the actual resistance, an hour.</p><p>Then we stayed around there and then we went there, I don't know. I don't really know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you have any idea of what was really happening? Did you know where -- was there anybody reporting to you, telling you what was going on? Run, the Germans are coming?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's about the size of it. Run, the Germans were coming; run the Germans were coming. Everybody ran and I did too. I remember that I got a bicycle on which there weren't any tires on it and it just -- it worked.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you were able to ride away?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I ride a little bit, not very long. Then I gave that up too and I was taken prisoner.</p><p>They were just coming, so many of them. So many Germans come through and they were well organized, well organized. They were not on horses at all.</p><p>Everything was motorized, everything.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What did you see first in terms of the German army? Did you see infantry or --?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Infantry, always infantry and planes, yes. Always planes, always overhead. The infantry came after the planes, the planes strafed us and then came the infantry.</p><p> 8 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

They said, well these are the French army. That's all there was at that time, there wasn't very much. I know that I went to -- I was evacuated at that time. I don't know how I got there but I got to Bacarah and that's about 30, 40 miles off there. From Bacarah I was transported in the forty men, no, a hundred men, 50 men and 10 horses on these trains. They had us on those trains and shipped us back to Germany.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you were in there with horses?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no, not me, not me, not with horses. The train is called either 50 men or ---..</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, in terms of the size? I see. This is a boxcar of some kind?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: A boxcar, it is a boxcar. We were in there. We were moved to Bacarah, from Bacarah to -- I don't know where. We ended up we ended up in Trier and that's where I was registered as a prisoner of war.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How long was that journey?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't think I can remember. I'm sure it was longer than one day, I think two or three days. From Bacarah to Trier, it's not very far really and that's where I was registered, 10,088, my number. I remember my number.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You were with other prisoners?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, plenty, plenty.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You were with people, you still, anybody from your company was with you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They were not from my company, they were all mixed up. There was nobody from my company. Really I don't understand how it was around there that I was not together with permanent people but I always changed so quickly. Anyway it was a hard time. This was definitely one of the worst times I passed in Germany when I was shipped out from that camp to get the barbed wire out of the west coast of Germany to the east coast. We got the wire from the west coast and rolled it up and they transported it to the east in preparation for the Russians.</p><p>They took us right away. Finally they learned that I spoke German and from then on, it was better time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So how long were you held in Trier?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, I was all the way in Trier until late 1944. In the meantime I was shipped back and forth to a farm in Trier.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How do you spell that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: L-a-u-f-e-l-d, Laufeld.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What do you remember about the conditions there, at the camp?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Once we were back with the peasants, we were pretty well off. Once we were back with the peasants, we had much more liberty.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That is working on the farm?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: On the farm, yes. Much more liberty and at that time, again I didn't speak German at all. Again after a while, they learned how I spoke it, what can I do huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But that worked to your advantage?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It worked to my advantage, yes, it worked to my advantage.</p><p> I can't say that it didn't because if I said that, it wouldn't be true, it worked to my advantage. But the Germans are our enemies, they are, they were and they will be. The Germans are our enemies, they do not like Jews. I remember one time when we were in 1943 when we were in that camp, there came a delegation of German soldiers and they asked us, which one is a Jew? Which of you is a Jew?</p><p>I didn't speak German at all at that time? When they came, I didn't of course. I don't know why the other guys didn't tell these guys, I don't know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell them that they knew that you were or --?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Sure, they knew that I spoke German at that time. But they didn't tell the other guys and I don't know why. Anyway there was a delegation there looking for Jews. They were looking for Jews, which one of you is a Jew. My friend Jacques de Fren, good John, came forward and said, there are no Jews here. We are all French soldiers. I thought he'd shoot us right away but he didn't and they left. I don't know who was what and where but I spoke German when I was in this farm, in several forms. I worked in one, two, three, four different farms. At the end, I even got a tractor. This one I was able to operate, a tractor with the plowing and all of that. He gave this to me, the foreman gave this to me. The foreman couldn't work anymore so he gave this to me to operate, so I operated it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was the nature of the work on the farm? Was it just -- were these all to help out the general farm work?</p></p></dialogue>

I think that the hardest work was to pick up potatoes. When you cut the potatoes out of the ground, you have to pick them up into these baskets and I tell you it was very, very hard, very hard work. When the foreman on the farm gave us something to carry around, he wanted this oats to be moved up -- from downstairs to upstairs. He gave me a little les. He gave me a little less.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: These were sacks?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Sacks of oats. Gave me a little less. Transport the oats. This is the oats from I don't know how many fields, I don't know. Five of us carried the stuff upstairs.</p><p>This was quite a bit of drudgery but we did it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you sleep at the farms?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, we slept ina camp. We had to come back from these peasants, back to camp every day and we slept ina camp. There were eight of us, Laufeld had 8 prisoners.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, that's all?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, it's a small hamlet.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Where did they hold you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They held me in one of these little barrack type of thing.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What about food?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The peasants gave us very good food. I mean it was probably Russian, whatever, but to me it was plenty. Anyway I didn't eat too much at that time. It was just fine with me at those four places.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Those four places, were they all in the same area?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They were all around Laufeld.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So Laufeld was your hub?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was the hub, yes, that was the hub. I stayed in Laufeld until late 1944 at which time the soldiers said, now you have to out and you have to repair the railroad tracks in Trier. That's where we went first, in Trier. Of course the railroad tracks was a mess. That lasted for a couple of months.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was marched, we marched a lot at that time. The winter came, the winter of deg44, deg45 and how was it that I got into a hospital. I got into a hospital at sometime.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What kind of hospital was this?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was a hospital in -- it was bombed -- a bombed out hospital. The lower floors were still going, were still intact and the top was bombed out.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We weren't held any more. That was between September, October, November and then the snow came. I know that one of those planes, from the British plane, shot up one of those trains going through the rail that we were guarding or whatever and they were shot down terribly. They were saved for their lives so I felt through with them, that this was going to be the end. Then I got into that hospital. The hospital finally in January or February, no January 1945 was liberated by American troops.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yes, oh yes. I was still within Germany. As a matter of fact, at the time I finally left Germany it must have been the end of January, 1945. There were a lot of people, a lot of girls too on that train that finally left Germany.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When you came back into Paris, where did you go from that point?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: When I came back to Paris, my brother said he saw me and I was full of filth when I came to Paris. I was just full of filth. It was from every place, it was not very good. I was not very nice and clean.</p></p></dialogue>

They gave a form of despates. In France you have these colonial troops, despates. This you don't want to see because these are very large trousers that are attached to the belt. This is very funny, this is ridiculous and I had the despates uniform on for at least three months, four months.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The same uniform?</p></p></dialogue>

As you know, even at that time we wore one shirt and then we wore the next shirt and when that was more dirty than the first shirt, we wore the first shirt.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>This is what there was, there was not very much. But once we were out with the peasants we could wash our shirts, we could even prepare some food here and there. When we were with the peasants, we were treated very well. One thing that we were always afraid of is that one German soldier.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, we were prisoners of war. Mail was collected every several months. I do know that I wrote to my parents. First of all, I didn't write at all because I didn't want my name in the German files. In 1943, I did write and the parents answered.</p><p>They were already in Poland and they changed their name to Bactel.</p></p></dialogue>

I don't know what happened, I don't know. I always wrote to Brunswic and I don't know how this worked. It never was very regular but I did get a letter about like once a year, twice a year.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: From your parents?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: From my parents, yes. My father signed P, papa.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Nothing else, but that was just enough for me. I knew it was them. After we saw the planes coming over in September 1944, we were out with -- there was absolutely no correspondence at all. I don't know where they went. I just don't know. You just told me the thing that I didn't know. I didn't know how to address my father. My father's Bactel name. I never addressed anybody to the Bactel name. No letter came to Bactel name. I was always Brunswic. I don't know how they got it but they did get it though. They did know that I was a prisoner, they also did not know where I was. Of course, there was nothing to tell them where I was because the Germans didn't give out any information whatsoever.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you would write a letter but clearly it was looked at, information was taken out?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was very much looked at. Yes, sometimes, I don't know. I never knew that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: They knew you were a POW though?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. They knew that after about 1943. I know that from 1943 on, they got more regular, every six months or so, they got a letter.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What do you remember hearing about the progress of the war when you were a prisoner?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yes, we heard about it. We heard about it and we were very happy by the newspapers. For instance, I was very happy when I was in camp in Trier. When I translated, I didn't translate at Trier. It was not Trier. It was another camp that we were there first and I know that the Germans had a hard time in northern Africa. That was 1942 and I also know that I was in four years in that Laufeld place. It was first in a different place. It was in a different place, there were American ---, they're less than an officer, what do you call them?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I don't know what would be in between unless they were sergeants or ---?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Sergeants, right! That kind of thing. The Germans got the sergeants out of the enlisted men's quarters and at that time I got out of the enlisted men's quarters too because I spoke German.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So these were American?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no. This is in the German camps, this is before I got to Trier.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: This was barbed wire on the western front?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: On the western front and we tore it out from where it was and shipped it together on rolls and shipped it together to the eastern front. That was definitely so.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That must have been horrible work?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was the worst time. The first time, that was the winter of 1940, deg41. That was the worst time, even I think part of it also deg42.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How much barbed wire did you collect? It must have been thousands of feet?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Millions, millions. The Germans had everything and we just didn't have --very problematic was to grab the barbed wire and tear it out. We had leather hand things, leather gloves to tear it out and that was the hardest time I spent in a German camp.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What did you pull it out from? Was it nailed into ---?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, it was not nailed. It was staked in. We pulled out the stakes too. The stakes were -- everything was well designed.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: This was all in Germany?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> A; This was all before, before Laufeld, yes. Before I found Laufeld. When I finally found Laufeld, I think that was the end of pretty good for me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you cleaned up, prepared this barbed wire to be shipped to the other front for several months? Then you went on to Trier?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Then I went to Trier, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was it there they formally registered you as a prisoner?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, in Trier. That's right, I was not registered before. I was not registered before.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Where were they holding you in that first camp? Was there some kind of barracks or were you sleeping outside, do you recall?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, there were barracks and just too many people in each barrack. You can't do that to -- there were -- all those people were in barracks and we were in barracks too. After that, yes, I spoke German and then I got a bit better off. As a matter of fact, I told you that we first got the barbed wire off in Germany. Then later on they found out I spoke German and I got freed from this task.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: They felt they could use you in some other way, I guess?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right, to get the wires (?) around.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You translated for --?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I translated for the Germans, yes. Even then we knew how bad it was in North Africa and how bad it was in -- and how it happened. No it did not because North Africa was later. North Africa was 1942, "43. I don't know really, I'm sorry, I just don't have my reference now. But that was the worst time I had was the first year I was in camp in Germany. It was the baddest time I ever had. The food was bad.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was the food like?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Whatever. I don't know. I just don't know but there was some food just to keep us alive and working.</p></p></dialogue>

Why was there very little escape? Because at first everybody was under German power. The second one was there was a very great anti-Jewish community in France. I never forget them but I do know that the Jewish community in France, they didn't like us very well. But people escaped, yes. I did escape twice. The first time I got as far as the end of the camp, really.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: This was the first camp?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was when I was tearing up the barbed wire out of the ground. The second time I escaped from Trier. From Trier we had two people, three people with me.</p><p>We tried to go through France to Switzerland. The Alsace people, the people from Alsace-Lorraine, we got as far as Alsace-Lorraine ---.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, yes. No problem at all. We got over the bridge and into Alsace-Lorraine and we were caught by a person who didn't like the prisoners in Germany.</p><p>Because the Frenchmen didn't have much to eat and they thought that we were too fat. That was from Trier south to Alsace-Lorraine and we gave it to the German officials.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. They didn't like us and they gave us up to the Germans. The Germans came and they picked us up. I mean it was so easy, too easy.</p></p></dialogue>
