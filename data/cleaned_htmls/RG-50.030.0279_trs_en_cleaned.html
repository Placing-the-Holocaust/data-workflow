<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In January "31, 1909 in Czernowitz. At that time, the Austrian-Hungarian Empire.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Could you tell us a few words about the background of your family and about your childhood?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, my father was a house painter. My mother was a housewife. I had two more brothers, and our -- my has been somehow cultural because my father was very much <span class="page-break" number="0"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I reached Czernowitz in "40. And from "40, I worked under the Russian regime in a factory.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you witness any deportations done by the Russians during 1940?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yes. Yes. Just right before the war or the outbreak of the war, the Russians deported a lot of Czernowitz people which had been before well-situated, good situated. Had companies or he was a lawyer, even a tailor. They took a tailor. There was one tailor, a Social Democrat, they took him.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You are talking about Jewish people?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Jewish people, yeah. And of Christian people, they took very, very, very little.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can you estimate how many people were deported from Czernowitz, a rough estimate?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, at that time probably 5,000 and 7,000. They took from the province, also. And they made it, from the province, they made everything of Czernowitz, it's Czernowitz.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But when you say 5 to 7,000, you are talking only about Czernowitz, or about the whole occupied...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It's about the whole...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: About the whole?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: . .. because that is only the people who were good situated, the Russians. They didn't touch other people. The Romanians touched everybody.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I understand. Can you tell us what happened to you, and to your family once the military operations started in June 1941, the military operation done by Romanians and Germans against Soviet Union?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. I was at that time -- my parents were dead. My brothers were in America. I was the only one in Czernowitz, and I was married. And when I -- when the deportations began, they deported me, my wife, my mother-in-law and two more sisters-in-law.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I would like you to tell us a few words, in a few words what happened to you before the deportations. I mean, because Czernowitz was occupied by the Romanians sometime in June, and you were deported sometime in October, if I'm correct. So I would like to know what was the life at the beginnings of the ghetto in Czernowitz, your life . . .</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Life was very bad. Life was very bad. We couldn't get -- we didn't have any work to do. We couldn't do, but we were taken out for forced labor. I was taken out by my hair, and to clean the street. There was a big park in Czernowitz, Folksgarden (ph). What we had to do is clean <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> the park. We did all kinds of forced work, forced labor, but we didn't get paid.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember when was the Yellow Star introduced in Czernowitz, if it was any?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The Yellow Star, yeah, the Yellow Star was. But it came about two months or three months before the deportation. In fact, I was in an office when they told me to come, but I didn't have the Yellow Star. He told me "Where is your Hakenkreuz?" I said, "I have no Hakenkreuz." He said, "You need a Hakenkreuz." A Yellow Star. And by -- he didn't punish me, but it was some, I would say, a rarity. Because other people have been very much punished when they didn't carry a Yellow Star.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Could you tell us what happened to you and your family when the ghetto was sealed and when the deportations started in Czernowitz?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. Well, we -- when they started, every day they eliminated one or two streets where we have been before. And they pushed us more and more to another part of the city, which was in old time inhabited by a lot of Jews. This is not . And they pushed us every <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> university from my diplomas in engineer. And then we were walking, walking; suddenly, I fell because I slipped and fell into -- it was hole. But I got up to here, and I knew I couldn't get out. My wife wanted to reach out for me, but she couldn't, she was pushed further from me. Because she couldn't stop, she was walking. Somebody, probably a man, gave me his hand and pulled me out, so I came -- I was saved. I couldn't even thank him, I didn't know who it was because he was pushed, you know. We were so driven and hit by the soldiers that we couldn't even breathe.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: This was where?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In Akaki.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In Akaki.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They pushed us towards the Dnestr. My wife already knew that I'm dead. But then later I did find her on the shore of Akaki, and we went over at night and in a barge. Some people before us and after us were in the barge. They turned the barge, and fell in the cold water and they drowned. We somehow survived. Later on I did find my mother-in-law and my two sisters also. They survived and were already in Mogilev in a shack, in an old house. It was -- the house was uninhabitable, but it was there, so we started -- we had been united. The next day I heard that there was somebody who would make work for -- working for the government. Looking for workers. Workers who know their , so I went to see this <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> side, and he asked me, "What can we do here? What can we do here and here?" And I said, "It's very difficult, but we have to do whatever we can, and we will do." He said, "All right." So that was the beginning of my relationship with Yegendorf. He made me -- I have this document as a , the chief engineer. Chief engineer was a Mr. Bingerstratts (ph). He was the, how shall I say, the son-in-law of a very rich man from Radom, who was on the . Yegendorf was also on the . So this Bingerstratts was made chief <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> machine, for our blazer, the Timisoara (ph) infected was a -- have a molten, the iron started to work and we did a lot of things over for the government, for the Romanians. And, by the way, some people made money, the big ones of the Romanians.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: If my understanding is correct, some of the Jews from Mogilev were deported later from Mogilev to Szydlowiec, am I correct?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can you elaborate on this? Can you describe to us what happened?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I can only tell you that one day we had a lot of some -- in my department there was about five Mogilev Jews, workers, real good workers. And in order not to be deported, they had to be working in the Timisoara (ph). And so we had a lot in other departments, some Russian Jews. But the majority was deported to Szydlowiec or other places.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you witness those deportations?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can you tell us a little bit more about the life in the ghetto, day-to-day life about how was the ghetto business conducted by Yegendorf and so on?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It's difficult because I didn't -- I haven't been in the city, in Mogilev. My work was always with Timisoara (ph), but I heard Yegendorf was -- they had formed committees. And Yegendorf was the President of the committee. And the committee had some people from other localities, sometimes from , from Soroki, Domnitsa. In the beginning was Domnitsa and Mogilev, but then he went to Szydlowiec with his people. There was another Mr. Cotts (ph), an engineer from Soroki, and he became a member of the committee. And that was one man who was against Yegendorf. Yegendorf and Cotts were two . <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> like all kinds of, how shall I say, shoemakers. Carpenters. And they started to work, and Cotts was informed, was the President of these ateliers. And Yegendorf and Cotts were harassing one and the other and impeded a lot of work. Then a lot of people made business, they got their own collections to the gendarmerie. As they made business, they made stores, and they sold bread, cake, whatever. And they were very ingenious in making business. And, of course, at one time it was not thought it was a ghetto. It was just a business, but then came the other way. And they started to harass the people. We had the Jewish Police in Mogilev, that was not a very friendly people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What were they doing?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They were police, and sometimes they abused the people. They abused by making money.</p><p>They arrested people and people paid them, and then -- so I do not know very well about that because I was not active in that. But I heard what they told me was going on down in the city.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you stayed most of your years in Mogilev in Timisoara (ph) itself?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's it, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can you...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I really was in the Timisoara (ph) and not very far from the Timisoara (ph) was a building where we lived.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I understand.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yegendorf lived in the same building, and in a smaller building and he was living like a king.</p><p>When he left his apartment, he was accompanied by two bodyguards. Nobody could talk to him, and he went to the office. In the office, he was king.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can you tell us a few things about your most difficult months or years in Timisoara (ph)?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, it was in the beginning. The beginning was very, very difficult because we didn't have anything, and we didn't know what to do. I mean, we had to work, so we made whatever we could. Ingenious, we have invented a lot of things to make instruments and then with one -- the moment I had one lathe at hand, we started to repair another. So little by little, we became a very well organized factory, because we had a lathe and then the Timisoara (ph) -- as such and then we had one department we made smaller things. It was run by another colleague of mine very nicely. He made all kinds of screws and blades and so forth. And that was what we had to do.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I remember reading at a certain point about a statue which was built in Mogilev. <span class="page-break" number="5"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I don't know about that because it was done in very great secret. There was an architect, , who made the design, a statue, a cross. And they put the cross on front on a very <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> that, only when I saw the documents. That in my mind made him very low. This is war -- I don't want to use it -- but it's like a war criminal because in times of war then your friends are your enemy. But what we had to do under the impression, under the pressure, we had to do, that is one thing. But when we voluntarily do something, this is different.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I understand. Can you tell us about your experience toward the end of your stay in Mogilev?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>What happened when the Russians came, and how did you come back from Transnistria to Czernowitz?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, Yegendorf, it was a time when was at odds with Antinesco (ph), and Antinesco sent him to Mogilev. Federman (ph) -- that we have, Federman was in Mogilev, and he talk only to Mr. Yegendorf. And he wasn't even visiting the city. Federman wasn't visiting the Timisoara (ph).</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You never saw him in Mogilev?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no. I saw him once when he into the apartment of engineer Yegendorf. Well, and then finally when Federman went back, we thought that now a lot of things are regulated. But one day, one day I came to there and Yegendorf was gone. Yegendorf secretly left. Federman worked out...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: His release?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: ... his release. And Yegendorf and his wife left Mogilev secretly. And we were -- suddenly we were without a leader. You see, how bad he was, how good he was, but he was a leader.</p><p>And it's like a father, the son is like the father. Suddenly there's no father, he left. And everything was very -- in a very bad situation.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So he left without any warning?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Without anything. Not saying a thing. And a couple of days later, we say the Germans had opened a big storage place. They had storage over there with sugar, flour, bread, everything.</p><p>And they opened the doors and told the people, "Take whatever you want." My wife was also at that time left and went over there to take some sugar, some -- whatever it is she can take. And all the people went to take. Suddenly, the German came and started <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> 0 There was an officer, a Russian officer, a lieutenant. He said to us, "You are guilty that we have a war. You are a guilt -- because we don't want a war. We fight for you because we want to save you, but you are guilty." And that was the first greetings from the Russians, where the whole world thought when they will come we will be liberated. We will be free.</p><p>The first thing was this anti-Semitic remark. And they started to take people from us to mobilize people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: To draft them in the army?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. In the army. And I had to work. I couldn't leave. I wanted to go home. They told me, "You cannot leave. You have to work here. I will tell you when you can leave." And they never told me. So we were like forced labor, it was not very nice. And every day they came for us. It was finally I sent my wife before, she went home. I started to work over there, and then one day I decided whatever it will be, I go home, and I was lucky. My wife went to -- in Czernowitz, there is a factory where I was working before. And they gave her a letter that they need me. It was already under Russian regime. They gave her a letter that they need me, and I should be sent home from Mogilev. And with that letter, I went home. I came home and started to work over there, and after a couple of months I got sick. I got the trembling, I couldn't work. They made me an invalid for the time being. Then after I got my release from the hospital, they told me I started to look for getting out. Lucky I went to . They <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> 1 different kinds. And then I came to the United States.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Thank you very much.</p></p></dialogue>
