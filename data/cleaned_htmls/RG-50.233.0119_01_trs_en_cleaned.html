And there were other cases that, the peasant people they always wanted to show off their strength and there was one, he was known as strong. So he came over once and said "Let's wrestle." My brother said I don't want to wrestle, I'm not a wrestler. He said "Let's wrestle." He wanted to show he is stronger, so my brother didn't want to bother, and later he bothered him and he said "Okay, let's wrestle." So they took off their jacket, the other guy took off his jacket. It took a second, the other one was stretched out. So then he said that he approved he's the strongest. And then he was with me in the woods after a year and we escaped from the camp. But in the end he died of a heart attack, actually he had cancer in his mouth and then they gave him so much cortisone that, awful big dose, that he went for a visit to Israel and while he was on the visit to Israel he died and the dead was a heart attack, but this was caused by the cortisone. So this is about Leibush. Now, about Shulim, now you have written down here, I don't know, you have the record.....</p></p></dialogue>

He never realized that it was part of the Nazi, I don't use the word Nazi, as the Germans plan to kill the Jews. I don't who the Nazis, Shulim and German, maybe we can say the picture, because we'll take out , the picture that he asked me, or he can say I asked <span class="page-break" number="0"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So he went to public school and also to.....?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, he went to public school and after public school he went to cheder, to a Jewish school, like everybody else. From eight to twelve or one, we went to public school. Then in the afternoon, from two on, I think we went to cheder. And when the war broke out there was nothing left anymore, what else, there is nothing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did he ever help on the work detail?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, when he started, when he was twelve years old, he was sent out like everybody else, work details. It was arranged by the Judenrat, by the Jewish Council for the Germans to come and grab people from the streets, their houses, so it was arranged how many was in the work force from the ghetto, so everybody got a card that this and this day he has to report to work. They worked, they sent them out, since he became 12, he worked, came out two or three times a week to go to work, in the winter mostly by snow and the summer on the roads and other things. And we lived together because in the ghetto we moved in the apartment where Leibush lived; so happens that this apartment was in the place where the part of the ghetto was at. And we got the room and we worked together, we lived together. He wasn't, it wasn't so bad because my brother he was a member of the Judenrat, the first Judenrat and he was selected by the</p><p> about which we will talk later and then later he was arrested but, in the book it's written how he was released because only three Jews were released from jail, the rest were killed, the whole Judenrat. Leibush's father is still in the ghetto, he had his store because this was the place that he was not thrown out. So, how much he could buy and market things and this way he was not bad off in the ghetto. They had enough, everything. Until it was the transport to J and J to Belges and then they were killed. <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Poland at the age of twelve. So, what you can write too much, but I think what you have is enough material.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Anything distinguishing about his mother that you remember?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, his mother was a housewife and she took care of -- nothing distinguished. She took care on the house and Leibush took care on the store, but nothing special. But maybe to mark down that Leibush survived the war. That Leibush survived the war with me in the woods and died in America in 1960. Okay, now we have this, we have this and they will be the same kind of passports, the new ones?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I may even be able to find this book at the Library of Congress.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It's book, he has it, so I'll give it to you. Give Kevin the information, I'll tell him to make a copy.....information of Dr. Anderman. It's also, certain things is not correct also. Somebody who wrote it didn't know. Well, anyway he, said he never bothered with Jewish causes when the first time when they threw out the Jews from Germany in this was the first time <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> man by the Germans, he started to come to the commandant and he started to tell them all kinds of stories. He was not a very person, this..... he started to tell them which Jews have hidden merchandise, as a matter of fact my father suffered very much from this Jew. Like he came to my -- the Germans liked coffee, coffee beans. He came to my -- and we had coffee beans hidden so he came every day for coffee beans. Today he wanted two kilo, the next day three kilo and then four kilo....and then my father told him how much can I give you, I mean we don't have new shipments. He said to him a well, if you take so much water out it will be dry. So he said well if you don't want to give more I will take it, so he went to the Germans and he squealed that my father has hidden merchandise. They came over and they took away everything we had. I remember it was three days that they went and loaded everything we had because he squealed.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Not just coffee, everything?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Everything, they took everything, they took even personal things, everything because they said that he ---. They took away everything, we had a lot of merchandise because this merchandise could be sold and we could have money, but they took away everything. My father ran away, and then because he was afraid that they will arrest him, I run away and this time I run away to Russia, which later I came back. And he, and this man wanted to become the president because the Germans said you have to organize a Jewish council, but the Jews knew if he would become council, it would be very bad for the Jews because he was, like I said. Before the war everybody knew somebody wanted to have a witness in court, if there was a court case and they needed a witness, he would always be a witness for money, naturally. So even there was here in America there are sayings if I speak to some people from Kolbuszowa and I ask them something and they don't want to tell me a lie, so they said, what do you think, I am this and this? I don't want to mention his name because he has his family. So they say, what do you think I am him? He was known that he is -- for money he can be a witness. So then we Jews knew that if he would become the president it would be bad for Jews because he would collaborate with the Germans. So the Jews started to speak to prominent Polish Catholics, especially to the mayor, who we told him that we are very concerned that he would become the president, not only this, because if he will be president he will pick out members, his friends, his like, and then it will be bad. We the Jews, I say we, I say the Jews themselves, say the only one who could actually be stronger than him is Dr. Anderman, he didn't look Jewish, I mean he didn't have a beard, most of the Jews had beards and he spoke beautiful German because he started in Vienna and he was a proud man and he would never -- he would be able to protect the Jews. A group of Jewish people went to him and they said to him he should become so he said, I was never involved with Jewish things, I am a doctor. I don't <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection and everything that had to be done was done through the organization. If you want more details, in the book I have more details about Anderman.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So around July "41 he became the head of the Judenrat?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no. He became head of the Judenrat in, before the ghetto, he became head of the Judenrat in the middle of "40. In the middle of "40, even earlier, I would say in spring of 40, spring 1940, yeah. And then he ran the Judenrat and it was run very -- he was very just, and if they had to take money because they needed for certain things, he always took it from people that had money. If you want a few details you read the book about this chapter, you'll see he was a very fair man, and I liked him very much. Later he opened an ambulatorium, a free clinic because he was a doctor and he knew a lot of people don't have money, so my sister and the brother-in-law who was also a member of the Judenrat, had the empty store because he was in the flower business, and in the war they didn't have flower, so he opened in his store the ambulatorium. He was there two or three times a week in the afternoon, and everybody who was sick, especially the poorer people came there and he treated them without fee. He needed help so he asked me with other friend of mine, and he became -- we worked and he started to teach me how to dress wounds and how to clean boils and all these things and I was very good as I always wanted to be a doctor, I was very good at it. I went there and for this, because I was with him, this work released me from going to work on the roads or something and I worked with him for over a year in this ambulatorium.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When did that open? That ambulatorium?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: This ambulatorium opened in the middle of "40, yeah, I would say in the summer of 1940. And I worked with him with my friend, we........Then later more and more, I was more skilled, so a lot of things I could do, special with wounds and dressings and all those things.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You saw Poles and Jews there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no only Jews. No Poles, they had their doctors there, he wasn't allowed to treat Poles; the Germans forbid a Jewish doctor to treat Poles. Then also he gave me a job, before the war I was the buyer for my father's store and I used to go to different towns. They needed somebody to bring in the flour and other food what Germans gave on carts to the Jews, and this had to be, we had to bring it from Jeshup, from other towns. Also we had to buy a lot of stuff from the black market, like potatoes, they didn't give us enough, other things that we needed we opened a public kitchen, a soup kitchen in -- he organized a soup kitchen. The kitchen needed certain things that the Germans didn't give us, so I -- they picked me up and I went out twice a week to different towns. I got a pass and I could go out and I could travel, and I brought in all those things that the Jewish community got officially from the Germans. By going out and having this pass, I also could buy a lot of black market for the Jewish -- for the soup kitchen we needed, and also I bought on the black market for myself, for my family. I brought in stuff and they sold it so they could make something out of it, my father. So this was how we worked with Anderman and I became very, very friendly with Anderman and I admired him because he was very fair. There was something, a question about having privileges, the people who were in the Jewish council, they wanted to take advantage, he always was against it. Again in his book, you have the stories about it. Then they organized the ghetto, they organized the ghetto so he was responsible for the Jewish should have where to live. He built a house a year before the war, and this was the most exclusive, the most beautiful house in Kolbuszowa very ---. It was a</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

You see, he had a, not compressor, what you call it, to make electricity.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: A generator?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He had a generator and the generator produced enough electricity to take care on the toilets, with the water. It was a beautiful house, it had nice furniture, so this the head of <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection jail, because in jail they lived in one big basement, it was not like a regular jail, but they kept them in the basement from the magistrate building. So Anderman said that if he would ask somebody to become the president of Judenrat everybody should refuse. This way if everyone would refuse and to say that they cannot take care on this only Anderman can. This maybe will force them to let out Anderman. Meanwhile this Rappaport who was there he didn't listen to him and he told his wife to go to Twardon and tell him that her husband, this Pashik Rappaport is willing to become Judenrat. That he's young, he's energetic, he's good looking and the German would like him, and he speaks good German and they have a business in K . He looked at her, she was a good looking woman and one day the police came and <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Kolbuszowa with non-Jewish friends. They went to Warsaw and they lived this Aryan as Catholics in Warsaw. His wife survived but the son was an officer in the Polish underground when it was the Warsaw uprising. Not the Warsaw uprising but the Jews of the general Warsaw uprising, he was killed in the uprising. His wife survived and after a while she came over here an old broken woman. She died here in America. For Anderman, when he was arrested so the Polish people, even the mayor who was in went to V and told them he should be <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection or political, the Jews usually had two. They had political and Jews so the triangle made like a myogen David. So one was a red one which was a certain other transgressions and the other one was the yellow, the yellow was for Jews. So I got later from Auschwitz.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was his, do you know? What triangles did he have? Do you know the colors?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Usually Jews had red and blue. One was political and one was Jewish. On this, it's black and one, so I don't know. But this is probably what Jews had.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Once he was deported, you never heard from him again?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Once he was taken to Czechowice. He was in Czechowice about two weeks. When he was in Czechowice together with the other people from Kolbuszowa; this time they arrested not only in Kolbuszowa they arrested in other towns from the section where Czechowice was the head town. We used to come to one place every week with packages for them because there was one of the guards that he could be bribed. We gave him money and he took the packages with letters for them. If they arrived, I don't know. Because I had a pass to go out from the ghetto, I told you I went two, three times to buy, to bring the stuff, so I was the one who brought over the packages. We met in one place and there I met people from all other towns from around us.</p><p>Everybody did the same thing. They brought the packages and later this German, somebody came. They took the packages, they got paid and he supposedly gave them the food. But we never found out because he never brought back letters. We send them letters. He could take the money, take the food -- but so long as there was hope, everybody sent them. I think once they came in, that they brought back letters. He was there about ten days or two weeks. After two weeks they send both to Auschwitz. In Auschwitz, after a few weeks, I think after two weeks, the telegrams started to come.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you know what his said, his telegram?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't know because his telegram didn't arrive because there was nobody to send a telegram.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Because his wife and son had left?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: His wife disappeared. They disappeared the day he was arrested. But the other people, the telegrams came and I saw the telegrams. Mostly the telegram says that we want to let you know that your husband, this and this day, he died of cancer or he died on lung failure, TB. She had to sign that he suffered from TB. Then some they were killed while trying to escape. But this was not --.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You suspect he was gassed at Auschwitz versus being executed?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, they were all gassed, they were all gassed. But in the beginning, we don't know because this was in 1941. This was towards --.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: They were still building the crematorium?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They were still building it, so I don't know if this were gas or executed, we don't know. I would suspect that there was one --. The crematorium was already there. But the gas chambers I don't think were there. I never looked into it but I should have because after the war I was on</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

There was a commission that studied the crimes for the Germans. I was a member of this commission which was headed by Hewlett Johnson (?). He was the Dean of Canterbury. {You have photos of him, don't you Norman?} Yes, I have photos of him. The Archbishop of Canterbury and he was the head. The members of this commission were professors of universities from all over the world. There was an American, a Russian and I was sent from the Polish government. There were two delegates from the Polish government. I was one and the other one was, his name was Meega. But his name was not Meega, he was a lawyer from Cracow, his name was Dissenfeld. Later he lived in England. He was a lawyer before the war.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: A Jew?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: A Jew, yeah, distant. But then he masqueraded as a non-Jew. His name, he changed it to Meega. We were both sent but we were sent as members to this commissions, from the secret police. Because they wanted to know what contacts they had, this delegation. They didn't trust nobody. So this Hewlett Johnson who was quote a "Red Dean" because he was very pro- communism. He was archbishop. They wanted to know what connections he had with the Polish underground, with all those things. We were sent and officially we were members of the Polish delegation but our mission was completely different. This Hewlett Johnson, the reason they called him the "Red Dean" was because when it was the Korean War, he went to Korea and he wrote how the Americans behaved and what the Americans are doing, very pro-communist.</p><p>Then later I wanted to go and I went over to one commentator and wanted to tell him how he was misled. How we arranged his meetings with the Polish peasants, with the Polish patriots so that everything was such officially done and everything was lies. That the government did it just to show him. Then later, he said to me, listen they won't bother you, don't start because you came over here. They will ask you how you know those things and --. So I let it go. I went, his last name, his name Barry Gray. He was a very outspoken commentator, I went to him. He said to me, you come over here, you had so much trouble. Don't go into more trouble.</p><p>I could find out from Auschwitz in the beginning everything because I was the authority but there were so many things. The war was still going on that this was secondary to --. But I made pictures in Auschwitz, I have the pictures still today. You don't have all because we didn't come yet to those pictures. This is -- I made a list, the pictures that I gave you. Is supposed to be 150 but actually it was 153 because some were made A.B.C.</p></p></dialogue>

Now Henoch, his hair was darker. It was a dark blond hair and dark eyes. He had a more olive complexion and he was always more serious than Blimcia. She was always happier than -- so this was --. {How about some chocolate to stick in your mouth?}</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Just --.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't know if I should describe Henoch's brother. {You're not writing about him. Just the name is enough. }</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What do you remember about how your sisters were with these two children?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: What do you mean?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I don't know, anything special about the way they treated them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They treated them like a mother treats a child. They were crazy about them. Not only for them.</p><p>You see, those children, they didn't have one mother. They had five, six mothers because my grandmother was --. They were more in my house than they were in their house because we lived not far. Blimcia's girls, their house was next to our house so a whole day she was by us.</p><p>She ate by us, she went home to eat, to sleep. The other one also, they were more home. All my sisters, the other sisters considered them our children. Special with me, I was the closest with them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Because you were the youngest?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, not only the youngest. I was the one, especially in the war, that I used to go around in different towns for merchandise. Every time I came, there was not a time that I shouldn't bring something special for them. If it was candy, fruit about the first cherries, the first apples, the first pears -- every time if I could only buy a few, it was for them. It was also, that we always laughed, that they knew that I am away in another town and I have to come back. Usually I came back on a bicycle; they always used to wait. By Jews there is a saying when you mention Sabbath, you always say Shabot Kordish. It means the Holy Sabbath. She heard the Shabot Kordish, there was another expression that when children came to their grandparents or to their aunt, every Saturday they came for Sabbath fruit. They gave them a treat. They used to come in and they used to say Shabbos Optz. Optz means in Jewish, fruit. They used to give to ess Shabbos Optz to get something. When they waited for me to bring something, somebody mentioned oh you waiting for him because he's going to bring you Shabbos Optz. This girl she remembered something but she didn't remember exactly so when I came in, so she came to me and she said if I brought her Shabbos Kordish. It means the Holy Sabbath because she didn't remember the expression. Since then she knew every time I came so both of them wait and they say give me the Shabbos Kordish, it means the Sabbath fruit, the Holy Sabbath. But everything for us, we had something. Naturally they were the first one because we were a very close family and the children from my sisters, were our children, were the same thing. It didn't make a difference who the mother was, her mother, his mother loved us as much as her, and her</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

If my mother in the ghetto, if she had something, if I brought her something special or something, they were the first one to have it. | remember we once received a package from Turkey. In the package was a salami, a Swiss cheese and a package of chocolate. All kinds of goodies that we didn't have it in ghetto. My mother, naturally took it, it was something, she divided it in small pieces and they were the first ones to get it. Later when I came to America so I asked my brother, we got once in ghetto a package from Turkey, did you send it? He said I didn't send it but there was once an ad in the paper that said when you pay in fifteen dollars, a Turkey company will send to any place in German- occupied Europe, a package. So he went, he sent in $15.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: This was your brother in Palestine?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, my brother in America. He sent in the $15 and we got it. It was the highlight in the ghetto</p><p> to get a package for those things. A box of margarine, a box of crackers, a box of tea, coffee.</p><p>Then I asked him how many packages did you send in? He said once. I asked why once, we got it. He said why didn't you send it every day. Yes, he could afford it. Every day, send in $15. He said well I didn't get a receipt that you received it. I said, how could you get a receipt?</p><p>We were in the ghetto. But to take a chance, maybe 99% it will get lost but 1% it will come in, why not? So -- it was late. I remember when we got those goodies, my mother divided and every day they came and they got the piece of cheese, they got a piece of salami. We were very, very, very close and naturally the children were everything. For this reason, now I have grandchildren their age. I look at the grandchildren and I see those children and how those children were undressed. The mother had to take them in to a gas chamber. They had to be killed being two and three and a half years old. The mind cannot absorb it. We cannot talk about it because there are no words to talk about it a million and a half children.</p><p>Those were such beautiful, beautiful children. They didn't ask nothing from the world, they only wanted to be alive. Naturally they didn't realize what's going on. This is how they went.</p><p>I think that f you will write about them, you'll put them both together not separate because they were -- they lived together -- they were the same age, they lived in the same house. Everything I remember when they came to our house in the ghetto, they always came together. They were beautiful, they were nice dressed and --.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: They lived apart from you in the ghetto, otherwise?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They lived, before the war, this Blimcia lived next door to us because my father bought them a house next door to us. He lived away, I would say about 200 meters. During the day, he came over. During the ghetto we lived on this street, we lived far away, maybe 100 meters. Only they had to go all the way to us. So they were by us practically every day, all day.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When they were deported to Belzec, they were with their mothers?</p></p></dialogue>

You see, when you get a transport like this with children like this and special to tell the story, their game. They didn't play ring-a- round-the-roses or something picking up flowers. In their mind this was something important.</p><p>This Habier went out and he killed Jews. They turned around in a game. I witnessed a few times, I was standing there, I couldn't grasp it. He tells and he imitates this German, he said when you are Jewish you are dead. Everybody knows that when he makes poof, they fall down.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you think they ever saw that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no, they just heard talking about. They heard talkings that Habier killed today a Jew. They didn't see it no, but they heard talking about it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: This was the German police?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: This was the German police. He was like a meister, like a sergeant with the German police.</p><p>Especially he was in this time, a very vicious man. He always walked around with his face, he always had a big German shepherd on the leash. Because mostly German police had German shepherds.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did he work with Tarnoff?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: What? Tradon. Tradon, no. Because when Tradon --, well he worked, he was the police. But then later he was transferred. When the ghetto was there, he wasn't there anymore. This was before the ghetto. They were transferred, you know. There was a other guy who worked with Tradon, I describe it in the book, his name was Smicher. This is the one who came to beat up my brother and then later he took him out from jail. Then later -- so he was also there. It was special certain German policemen that they were exceptional vicious. They were known for their viciousness. There were some who were nice. Nice, it doesn't mean that if they would catch you without a band on the street, that they wouldn't arrest you or shoot you. But they didn't go out of their way to do more harm than they were supposed to do. There were a few.</p><p>There was even one I also described in the book, that one who was also a sergeant, a meister.</p><p>He used to go for vacation home and he always used to bring stuff that my brother asked him to bring like saccharin and other things which was illegal but he brought it and my brother bought it by him. He made money and my brother made money. Now this is the one, he told us to go with the transport the first day. Because he said, we don't control, the Gestapo controls it and you never know when the Gestapo changes from one day to another. We went with the first day with the transportation. So we had Blimcia, who else did we have to have there?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mundich had found you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Mundich told me. Everybody told me that something they caught a Jew, like here somebody would catch a killer or G-d knows what. You caught a Jew and what happen. My father was just one hour walking distance. I don't know that he is there and he didn't know where I am.</p><p>He thought I am in the ghetto and I thought that he was sent to Belzec, I didn't know. He told me that he would get in touch with me, within three weeks if he managed to get off the train. I didn't hear from him so I assumed that he is dead. Therefore I let myself be persuaded by the car ride to go to his house. So when this happened he heard about it, Mundich, but he didn't want to tell me until after months later, what happened to my father. By the way, the girl who jumped with him, survived. Mundich told me. She was by the peasant's house and then she let herself be caught as non-Jew to a slave labor and she survived in Austria because she got in touch with this Mundich. Told Mundich the whole story. Also she needed somebody like I needed somebody, when you are masquerading as a gentile After all you have to have family, to get some mail. So Mundich used to write to her. He just doesn't know when the war ended, what happened to her. But he told me he used to get letters from her from Vienna. This is the story. I think it is very important, devotion, courage, no nothing to be packed like sardines; to be able to pry the boards; to jump out of a running -- any train to jump. The point is that you only have slightly bruised knees. The girl was not harmed at all.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did he break through the bottom of the train, do you know?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: {They didn't jump, they didn't jump. What they did, the train has a floor. The floor are grooved boards so he pulled out two boards. While the train was running, what they did, they let themselves down, through and between the wheels and the train went and they were not touched.} I mean he had only the height, the bruised knees I was told and the girl not at all. I think a story like this again, it's unusual, hair-raising, courage and devotion should be told. It's not only because he's my father but this should be told the same thing about my sister.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was his father's business? He was in the lumber business?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no. Before the First World War, my father was from a very wealthy family. He used to have forests and they used to have mills. During the First World War --.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Lumber mills?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. During the First World War, it burnt down. They remained only with an inn and a grocery store. This what remained and they were not anymore so rich. The point is also that his mother used to say always you see, material things you have, you can lose. She believe very much in giving education to her children and all her children got education. This is why my father too, he say, I prepare dowry for you, he had hard realty but I don't know if he would if he would also foresee if I would be able to take advantage. So let me give my daughters the best education that I can because with this they will be able always to make a living. This why, do don't forget, this is from kindergarten, he paid --.</p></p></dialogue>

He sent us all to all this and don't forget that the earning possibilities in Poland were not the same like in the United States. To be able to afford it, means that he had to deny himself certain things to be able to do it. After all, he was not a millionaire, he was not the richest man, he was comfortable but not the richest, but you always have priorities. With him, priorities was education.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember, did he ever paint in the house?</p></p></dialogue>

This is also the things of the sages and the wise men. If one of us didn't know, he deprived us of allowance to go to movie. You know there was a carrot and stick; a lot of laugh, a lot of devotion, attention, strict like boys. He raised us like a Prussian officer. You know girls like it more easy. Thank G-d my mother was a very sweet, easy- going woman. With my mother we were like friends, she was also very young mother. With him, also he laughed and he bossed around four women in his house.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He didn't -- how will I manage to shelter a child. He was saved by this woman, this peasant.</p><p>She didn't ask any questions. By the way, he didn't look Jewish. He was blond, green eyes.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In terms of having a look that didn't look Jewish, that helped you too?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, my father looked less like Jewish. I had Semitic eyes don't forget. With me, really was luck that the Germans thought I'm Polish and the Poles thought I'm German but no one took me for their own, you know. My boss questioned my eyes, Semitic eyes. In college, I was always on the offensive instead of being on the defensive. You know the book when the policeman followed me and I wanted to know if he's just a womanizer or really --. He followed me to the ladies" room. Instead to shiver and to feel defeated, I jump on him, what right do you have to follow me? This is -- after all I knew who he is. This put him off! He was a police and like nothing he would have given me away. In all instances like my boss, I start to say no and to deny and to be caught and to blush, I said most probably my grandmother was Jewish. He thought it's the best joke. You know this is how I was able. We saw now a movie and I told Norman, it was very similar I acted. Which was it, Norman, the last one that we saw? Oh, you didn't the movie "Shining Through"?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The same. Don't forget I didn't have any experience and I was 17, 18 but somehow my logic in this dictated me to act like it is. My father had a good chance. He had a very good command of Polish and because we didn't speak Yiddish, he didn't have the singsong like I don't have. I don't have in my Polish and I don't have in my English. This helped a lot because if you have the singsong, immediately they recognize it. Many looked not Jewish but they couldn't do it.</p><p>So please put</p></p></dialogue>
