It was a fun day.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Everybody had parties, and it was a little bit of a tradition to write a little poem, when you gave somebody a gift, and you could -- you could be very -- you could be criticizing the person to whom you gave it, but make fun, in a fun way.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So it was a really wonderful celebration. I never heard the word Chanukah until I came to the States.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="22"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, it was my mother who made me conscious.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Not your father.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And well, in retrospect, I can see what happe -- my mother kept saying to me I was Jewish and I had to be careful because there were so many anti-Semites in the world.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And she said that to you when you were quite young?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What did you think about that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I didn't agree with her because I hadn't -- I-I hadn't felt any until the very last year, I used to pick up two friends along the way to school. And the first ones were quite -- you know, did you ever hear the word [indecipherable]? They were very conservative and the father came from a family that had a plantation in the East Indies. So they were very well-to-do, but they were not very friendly, they were cold. And so even was the girl whom I picked up, but I didn't want to go to school all by myself.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. So at what point would -- we were talking about whether you ever experienced anti- Semitism. Was she antis -- was that family anti-Semitic?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, just cold.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Just cold. So when your mother is warning you that there are a lot of people who are anti- Semitic in the world, you just don't find this to be the case, you're not -- that's not your experience. It was --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, that was not my experience --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- until Hitler came.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He didn't say that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh. So did you say to him wh-why is she saying this, I don't -- you know, where -- where are the anti-Semites?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Cause you're not -- you don't -- no.</p></p></dialogue>

And --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And so you heard that?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I-I heard that and I had a friend who was one of them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: She became my bosom friend all the way through, as long as we knew each other.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So once he goes, you never see him again?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. And I never knew whether he was alive or dead after the war, until the Red Cross released some report, and it turned out that he then died.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And where -- where was he taken, do you -- did it say?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We knew that he would go to Westerbork.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You did know that, because that's where they were sending the Jews.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That we knew.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And the brother of Tante Toos was in the underground and he had heard that they had took -- where they took my father.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh. So did you -- your mother knew that before you did. Your mother must have known that when you were in hiding. You think?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I-I was there when he told.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When he s -- so you knew too.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No idea at all. So is it very soon after your father goes and leaves and he's not there, that your mother says we're going? Does she do it right away?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, we went at dusk. We took our stars off because we weren't supposed to be on the street after dusk --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- at that time. I don't remember even whether we took the tram or walked all the way. She said we are going to Tante Toos, we are going to stay there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: She did say that?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Cause -- and you had -- you had met her?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, because I always went th -- bread with m -- with my mother, I went to the bakery that Tante Toos was managing at the time across, and ju -- it was right across the street from us.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see. So you lived in that older apartment? Yes, not -- not the one at Pieter Hooch? Or did she -- di -- was her bakery near --  <span class="page-break" number="35"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, when we moved from the street where we lived, where she had the bakery, we moved to a different street.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And so far as I know, they had no contact any more, but they did.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But they did. So they were clearly very close in some way in order to make these kinds of plans.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, she was very grateful to my father, because she had worked for my father for many, many years.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see. In his cafe? Is that where she worked?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, like a little coffeehouse.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh, right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You could get coffee and tea and pastry.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And she had married a man who was 25 years older than she. He was in the military but he had done something bad, and he was out of it, and he was old, so she -- she was the breadwinner.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And when we went to the Pieter de Hooch Strat, she became the manager of a liquor store in an entirely different neighborhood.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Hm. But obviously they -- your mother and she obviously had something in common in that they were both the breadwinners in their house.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Which in some ways was unusual.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, they -- they were really pretty good friends, and --  <span class="page-break" number="36"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- but there was a bond with my father because Tante Toos had eight miscarriages.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Eight?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Wow.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And each time she had to stay out of work.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And m-my dad kept the job open for her each time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Each time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And she was very grateful to him.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right, right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's what did it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So there were a lot of connections with the family, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Huh. So you -- you remember that -- your mother saying we're going to Tante Toos.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And did she have a bag that she took?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, we had a little bag, not -- nothing big.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Nothing big. Were you able to take something for yourself, or did she just grab the two kid -- the two of you, put on your coats, take off the Jewish stars --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: 1-- I could take a couple of things, and I think that's when I took my diaries.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh. Cause by then you had been writing in them for a few years.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="37"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right, for three years or four years.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And wa -- then I was supposed to go to Tante Toos's sister and brother-in-law who lives nearby.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But they lived on the third floor in a small apartment and I was to stay with them. But after a few weeks they -- they got cold feet and they said, "We don't -- we can't keep you here because there is no place to hide you anywhere." So in the dark one night, Oome Cor, we called him, he took me to Tante Toos.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: We have to change the tape.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>End of Tape Two  <span class="page-break" number="38"></span> </p><p> Beginning Tape Three</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Let's see, I think I've been confusing some things. I think that I said that it was Uncle Sam who came to stay with you, but it's not Uncle Sam, it's Uncle Alfred, is that right? So it's Alfred Schwartz, who is the brother of your mother, who came to stay with you, and then with whom you stayed when you came to the United States, is that correct?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. So when you go with your mother and Hedy, your sister, you -- you don't remember whether you walked or whether you took a tram to Tante Toos?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, they lived close by, we walked.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You walked. It was close by, I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I mean, when I went from Oome Cor to Tante Toos, we definitely walked.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yes, but now I'm talking about when you first went to Tante Toos --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Toos --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- from your house, do you re -- do you have a recollection whether you were walking, or whether you --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: [have a -- a hunch that we were walking because then, if we would have taken the tram, we would have been more visible.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh, right, right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was far, but I think we -- we walked.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You think you walked.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because we didn't want to attract any attention.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Attention. Now let me ask you something, when you -- you had to wear a star on your outer clothing and on your clothing, it's --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="39"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- just on your coats?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: On -- on --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: On the arm?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, arm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was that like for you when -- when that first started, when you were walking?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Awful.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It was awful.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And that's when I got in touch with anti-Semitism, because I had the other chum in school who was not Jewish. Her father also took her to school, and her father and my father became friends, and we became friends, too. And after the star, she came to tell me that she couldn't walk with me any more, that her parents didn't want her to walk with me any more because of that star.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What did you think?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Terrible.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It was awful, huh?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was hard.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did she feel bad, too, or did she just state, well this is what my parents say, this is what I have to -- you don't know, or y --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I couldn't tell.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I couldn't tell.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you were 14 at the time. Was 1942, with the star --  <span class="page-break" number="40"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: When I went into hiding.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No, but when you -- when the s -- when you first have to wear the star.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, I don't remember.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Remember. I think it was "42. So you're -- you're not a kid. You are -- I mean, you're a kid in a certain way.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>

So that was really hard on you, cause you're very conscious of who you are as a young person.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did anybody else do that to you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And when you were walking on the street, and you had the Jewish star, people stare?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: No, they didn't. So did the Dutch treat you in a o-okay way as far as --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: They did. Except for that one incident.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. There were a couple of h-homes that the Germans had occupied and the so -- some of the Soviets were sitting outside in the front yard and I would pass with my star, and they would whistle at me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: They would whistle. What'd you make of that? It's a little stran --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They were very young ones, very young soldiers, all of them.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So did you think they were whistling at you because you were a young, attractive girl?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Not because you were wearing the star.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no, I don't even think they saw the star.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see. So they were on your street?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It -- in what way does it -- it -- it -- you mean the -- there -- they became less and less friends as the time went on, not more and more. So that must have made it very difficult for you and your sister living in that sort of circumstance. Did -- did you take sides, do you think, in your head? And you were on the side of Tante Toos? Yes. And you feel a little guilty about that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But do you now, as you look back as an adult person, do you think she was right, or your mother was right, or there's no right and wrong here?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, it's difficult to say exactly who was right. It was understandable that my mother would not feel so happy.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Because she wa -- used to be the boss --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- and she wasn't any more.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And she'd lost her husband, of course.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So it was all very difficult for her.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes. And she wasn't working, of course, so that made it even worse.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="55"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But what was -- did she bring money into the house? She must have brought mo -- some money that she had so she could help out --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- with Tante Toos, yes? But you also said that you didn't bring things with you, but she hoarded food. So was there food in Tante Toos's house, that's -- so the food had been brought there, it was ready. And what kind of food could you --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Rice.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Ah, staples that didn't need refrigeration.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But there was a lot of it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: There was. So it lasted a long time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="56"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You -- you started a kind of a relationship that became very serious with Hans at a certain point, is that right?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Wh-When did that start? After you were there six months, a year? Cause you were there for three years.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: At least during the war, and then -- then for another year, or almost a year, yes? When you were 15, when you were 16, what do you think?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, and we both realized that Hedy was not getting any schooling.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And we tried, between him and me, to get Hedy ready for school --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Huh.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- so that she, when she came out wouldn't have to start at class number one --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- but she could put right away, and -- and she was ready.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So she didn't lose time because we had tutored her.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's fabulous. Did you have books? Did you have some books, or did you just make it up as you went along?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [had some French textbooks, but I think Hans had a few grade school textbooks left.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you like doing that? Wa -- di -- I mean, it gave you something to do.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="57"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. The fact is that Tante Toos did like to make a white lie. Nothing serious, but if -- if my mother asked her, could you get fish today, and she had just a little bit, she would say no, I don't have any fish for today.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Little things like that. And Hans began to notice it. That's what brought him closer. He didn't like that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see. So you became closer together.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: We need to stop the tape.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>End of Tape Three  <span class="page-break" number="58"></span> </p><p> Beginning Tape Four</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay, Betsy, when -- when we left the last tape, you were talking about Hans realizing that his mother told white lies.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And that this bothered him, and that this brought you closer together. Can you explain why that brought you closer together?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, we also had in common that we were teaching my sister. That was all at the same time, and it was shortly after my mother died. You know, my mother died while we were hidden.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes, I was going to ask you about -- right. So this -- this happened afterwards. So let's -- let's go back then, and talk first about your mother. Was your mother ill when you went into hiding?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, but she -- she wasn't ill, but did th -- before she died, she had these terrible headaches, and they became worse and worse and worse and worse. And Tante Toos knew a doctor from the underground, but we were all hoping, well, let's see how it goes through the night. And then, during the night, she expired. And this particular doctor, he saw to it that she got a grave at the Jewish cemetery near Amsterdam.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well he must have, because there she is. And not only is she, but my grandmother and grandfather, they're there too. And I have no idea who -- there must have been several people involved, to get her there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were your grandparents then -- they died in Amsterdam?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: They were not deported?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="59"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The -- a -- in -- in Amsterdam and there -- it -- it's not certain whether they got sick or whether the Germans hit them, or -- nobody knows exactly what happened. But they are now in the [indecipherable] cemetery by Amsterdam, right next to my mom.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And your -- your mother died in 1944, right? Is that right? You were bef --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah. My mother died on the night that the allies invaded Normandy.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That night.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: This must have been a big shock to you to lose your mother. Now -- now you -- you lost both parents.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, I woke up, my sister and I, we sleeping in one bed. I woke up and felt my mother was too quiet and I felt her hand and it was ice cold, of course. So I started screaming, oh Hedy, now we are whatyoumacalls, people without parents.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: An orphan.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you discovered that your mother was dead?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: She was sleeping in the same room with the two of you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right next to us, actually.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right next to you. Hm. Now, you didn't have a funeral, you were not -- they did -- they take the body away, right?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. No. And that same doctor, he arranged that her body was carried out and he really did a great deal.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: He did.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="60"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because he knew pretty soon -- pretty early that we were there. Yeah. I don't know who knew him, but evidently Tante Toos trusted him.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So this was very -- very quick, diz -- whatever this was --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- in your mother, it was -- it went very fast.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He si -- he thinks it was a -- a tumor in the brain.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm. Had she had headaches for a long time that you remember?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: She always had some headache.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: She always had it, uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But nothing unusual.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But this -- these were really extreme, painful?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, in relationship to when she died, prior to her dying, there was a secondary hiding place inside the apartment, right? There was a -- some sort of a false wall that was built.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How long before your mother died? Because she was there and hiding in that place with you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right? Was that a year before? Do you rememb -- do you have any recollection?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I'd say half a year before, but I don't know exactly.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Like I -- I don't know, Hedy said there was a hiding place underneath the -- the window where they displayed the bottles of gin, and whatever. Tho -- she said that was at first designated as our hiding place, but I don't recognize this at all, I don't remember seeing --  <span class="page-break" number="61"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right. Well, do you remember this other hiding place where this false wall was --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You do?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh -- oh yes, we were all in there, Hans too.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And why was Hans there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Hans was in there because the Germans wanted to have boys come to Germany and work in the factories. And Hans went to some kind of -- because he wanted to become a telegraph operator at sea, so he went to school for that, and that was one reason why he was still around, but when they did go around, they would pick up these boys and send them to the factories in Germany.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So there were -- there was mother and my sister and Hans and | in a very small place.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You would ha -- you would -- where was this inside the a -- the apartment? You've described that behind the store was the living space.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So what -- was it on that floor, that same floor as the -- as the store was?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. Actually, there was a kitchen, and the ceiling was that high. Right next to the kitchen was the bathroom, and the ceiling was much, much higher. And so they built a false wall.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: From the ceiling of bathroom, which was higher.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So how much space is there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Maybe two and a half feet by four feet. I can't think of it now, I'm getting mixed up with the - - I -- I forgot how to copulate cu -- how many cubic feet those are. It's small, extremely small.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="62"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Could you sit, or did you have to stand?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: We could sit, but we have to pull up our legs and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And how many hours would you stay there, usually?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It differed. Sometimes only half an hour, and sometimes two and a half hours.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And this was when -- when you would be warned that -- that Germans were coming?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And once the Germans were gone, then you could come out?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And do you know who would warn Tante Toos that somebody was coming? Do you have any idea?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It might be Uncle Cor, I mean, that was her closest link to the underground. But it might also have been word of mouth. I -- I couldn't tell you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. Was Hans connected with the underground at all as time went on?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: He wasn't?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Not at all.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He was not.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you fall in love with him?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, I did.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You did.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I thought I did.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And now you think it wasn't that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="63"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Why?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, we were pretty close together and at that age, what do they call it? Puppy love.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm. And so that's what you think it was?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But this must have been good for you in some way? No?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, it wasn't.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, it wasn't.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because a-at that time, he didn't fall in love with me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We were close friends, but he didn't fall in love with me until after the war. He had the close friend who came, and he paid attention to me, and Hans became jealous. And then Hans decided he was in love with me, and we were going to get married.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You were?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. Hans was going to get the job at sea, and then he'd pick me up, and then get married, and I'd be in Amsterdam. But just the fact that he was at sea, he wrote me pretty soon that he saw a girl in Hamburg, and they were going to get married. And that was that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And that was the end. So he wrote -- this is after the war, he wrote to you and said this?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah. For a long time he wrote almost like we are going to get married. I mean, that was really the real thing, but then suddenly came that letter that --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I see.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And he saw this girl in Hamburg.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But you remained in love with him for -- you were pretty constant?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="64"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, I was pretty constant.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was pretty constant, but I was -- but his friend was really the better one, only at the time I didn't realize it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: His friend was better for you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: His friend was better for me than Hans.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Than Hans, uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was he your first boyfriend?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: You could say that. When I was still in school, there was a minister living upstairs with his family and he took in borders, medical students a lot. And he had a nephew coming in who was my age. And nephew and I talked a little bit about things. That -- that was the closest I came to a boyfriend --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- at that time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. Now that your mother is no longer alive, is -- does Tante Toos become a -- a mother figure for the two of you, or do you become the mother of Hedy at this point? I mean, what -- what -- what happens now that your mother is not there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My father had always said, if something happens to everybody, that I should take care of my little sister. Tante Toos felt that she was the mother, and it made her feel good. And -- and Hedy responded very -- very well to her, but it was I who had to take her to the doctor, it was I who had to go downtown with her, get her new clothes, and she get her shoes repolished. I was really  <span class="page-break" number="65"></span> </p><p> closer so far as care giving is concerned. And Tante Toos was -- she gave us a roof over our head and food to eat.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But now you're talking about the time when the war is over, when you can leave. I'm wondering before the war is over --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And you're still in the house --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- and you can't go out.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, not yet, and half an -- about four months later, Uncle John died.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, after my mother.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Was very short, yeah. We lost two people. But Uncle John was old.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was old. How old do you think he was?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I think he was 82, and was very much paralyzed --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- by strokes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And he couldn't speak very well, and he had to be helped to bed, and to the bathroom.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And f -- we fed [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did -- did you spend time with him as well, or not?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, he was always sitting in his chair.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="66"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So when we came to the living room to eat, he was there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He was always there when we were in the living room, although on a one to one relationship with him, I think none of us had.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Uh-huh. And was he the -- the only husband of Tante Toos? This is -- this is the father of Hans? So it's not --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And Hans has -- had two half brothers from that first wife. Two half brothers and one half sister, and the half sister -- the brothers were caught in the Dutch East Indies. They were caught by the Japanese. And the [indecipherable] sister, she lived in the city not too far, and she also came to visit Tante Toos.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Hm. Okay. So when -- when you were in the house, a-again, now that the -- Tante Toos's husband is dead, and your mother is dead, does she become more of a mother figure inside the house, or she remains the same for you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: She remains the same.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: She remains the same. And do you begin to take even more care of Hedy even though you're -- you're in the house? Is that difficult for you? I mean, you're now -- how old are you? You're 16 in 1944, and she's eight. That's a big responsibility as a 16 year old, isn't it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you resent it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="67"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. Because she -- she was not a brat at the time, and she realized what was going on. And on top of that, after the war, when she went to school, she became very ill with whooping cough and pneumonia, and she had to spend several months in the hospital, several months before it all cleared up, because we were all undernourished.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yes. That -- was that last year a very difficult year because it was such a bad winter in 1944 and deg45 --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- in -- in -- in the Netherlands?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, it was a very bad year because the Germans, as they withdrew, took all the food from the farmers, everything they could. And all -- all the art that they could find, and sometimes they burned houses behind them as they withdrew. And we were isolated. Whatever food there was went to the German army.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So how did you get food? What did you eat?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We got one little loaf of bread, from whatever that was made we don't know. And maybe two potatoes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: This is a week?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And that -- but Tante Toos had connections, you see, and she had connections with people who sold eel, smoked eel, which is a delicacy in Holland, and with people who ha -- had the pastry shop. And maybe a baker. Couple of people that she changed then her little bit of gin or whatever it was, because she got less, too, she exchanged it then for food.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was she still getting these ration -- with this fake ration books, so she could use it, or was that not even done any more?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="68"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: After the war I don't think we had them any more.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But it still went throughout -- until the war was over?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But it became harder and harder --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- to [indecipherable] food. Do you -- do you remember being very hungry?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. Actually, when I came in there, and I had to stay in the house, like [indecipherable] I got very heavy, and when there was not so much food, my weight dropped, and I was not sorry. But I didn't realize that I was undernourished.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It came out later on in different ways, but no I didn't really feel -- that the worst feeling was of being isolated, knowing that the other kids were growing up and going through the classes, and seeing the wa -- the professors, and social life, and it was out. I didn't have it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you felt deprived?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I felt very much deprived that way. Of course I missed my father, too. We were very close.</p><p>Yeah, I felt out of it, you know?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You felt out of it? But around you, you were seeing a s -- a -- a kind of normalcy of the non- Jews --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> <span class="page-break" number="69"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- of those wh-who were not being oppressed. Do you think it was so easy for them? Or that it was more n -- it was normal, what -- in other words, the people who weren't hiding like you, were they living a more normal life as far as you were you concerned? Do you think?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, not a hundred percent. Socially they were.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: That's what I was thi -- I felt isolated from the other kids --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Kids.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- who were growing up, who were going classes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Going out together, had picnics together, and got to know people, and here I was.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Alone.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you -- in "44, given what you were hearing on the radio, did you think the war would be over soon?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And then it wo -- then it seemed sure that it would be over?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, people have great hopes. That's why it was so difficult in the wintertime when there was no food, and people had hope. Somehow the Red Cross in Sweden could get airplanes over Holland and throw down white bread, a couple of times, during that bad time. How they got there, I don't know. Was dangerous. But -- and even after the war, they helped us out with white, good bread.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="70"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember the Nazis leaving the Netherlands?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You don't.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, all I knew was that we didn't hear any more stories about them. And toward the end there, there was -- well, Tante Toos says come out on the street, that is very quiet, is nobody here. A-And that must have been May the fourth, or something like that. So we went out on the street, it was quiet, no tanks, no heavy footsteps, those German marching footsteps. And it was just uncanny. So that's when we knew there are something going on.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And it -- obviously they seemed not to be there, so something was up.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They seemed not to be there any more.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, yeah. We have to change the tape.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p><p>End of Tape Four  <span class="page-break" number="71"></span> </p><p> Beginning Tape Five</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Betsy, could you re-describe the scene when Tante to -- Toos says it's clear, there's n -- there's nobody here, come out. What -- what did -- what is it that you see? Do other people start coming out?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So describe the scene that you -- that you remember.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, it's tra -- it's a very wide street in a newer -- ne -- at that time, newer part of Amsterdam. And there are s-stores all on the first floor, and apartments on top of the store. And people came out of the doors [indecipherable] talking to each other, exchanging news. There's one thing that happened during the war that I think that it made me a whole different person. The Germans were going through that town again, looking for Jews, and they were in our street th -- for the first time. And we were about two houses -- two stores away from the end of the block.</p><p>So they came from the other side and searched all the houses, and when they reached the end of the block before ours, they stopped, they were finished. They went home.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: They just left?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, that was not yet when they withdrew, I mean --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right, right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- they were still doing their jobs.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. But they didn't come to your street.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They didn't come to that block. Now, I think that's a wonder.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And what was the street named that you were hiding on. What were -- were -- were Tante Toos living?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Jan Svertsenstraat.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="72"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And that was in this -- in the -- the new --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Newer.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Newer part of Amsterdam.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Of Amsterdam.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Is that in the south of Amsterdam?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Southwest.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Southwest. So when are you sure that the Germans are gone?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think the ships in the harbor, they started blowing the horns. And at -- that -- that was announced over the radio.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So do you remember feeling relieved?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, sure. But you know, I thought how wonderful, the war is over. It was a terrible war, now we are always going to have peace. That's what I really thought.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It's understandable. You've been disappointed, I would gather, yes. What did you thi -- what was one of the first things that you did? Did Tante Toos want to adopt you when the war was over? Did you s -- did you speak about staying with her, or -- or what?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: This is a long story. Again, we hadn't talked about it. It was -- we were going to stay with her until we went to Uncle Alfred. But during this time, I went to see -- me and my friend who wasn't supposed to walk with me in the star, where she was. Well, her parents had this sort of a - - a sewing hand embroidery store. And she was not in the country, she was studying to be a pharmacist somewhere else. So I talked to the parents. And they asked how we were, and they -- they wanted to know how things were set up, and how we slept, and wh-where the -- see where  <span class="page-break" number="73"></span> </p><p> the coal was, you see, because a basement was usually for coal, anthracite. And they were just wondering were we right next to the coal, or what. Okay, fine, I-I didn't see them any more, I didn't hear from them any more. One day a social worker comes in. Are Betsy and Hedy Cohen living here? Yeah, why? Can I see them? Sure. So she came to us in the back and she said, you cannot stay here. This is no way of living for you, in the basement. Hans slept in the basement, too. There was a partition, curtains. And with a young man sleeping there, we find that's not right. And we all put up a big stink.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And what did y -- this was a she, this social worker?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The social worker was a she.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: She came that once and told us, and I think there was a phone call that we should go and then there was a letter and how did they know where we were? Because of the parents of that -- that friend.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was Tante Toos there also when she said these things?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. Now she -- she had an answer, she -- she was right up there, and then Hans was there, we all di -- and even Uncle Schaap, and he said no, th-they should stay and -- but that was really something. I go to these parents in good will, and they send a social worker out after us.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Now what -- was your intention that -- from the very beginning, was Tante Toos told that if something happened to your parents that you would be contacting your Uncle Alfred and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- and Aunt Anne is -- Anne is her name, yes?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, uncle and aunt, yeah.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="74"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What's her name, the aunt's name?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The aunt?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Annie.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Annie. So Tante Toos knew this?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But here she is being with you folks for three years, living every day --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Mm-hm.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- with you two kids. Does she want you to stay? Does she not want you to go?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think in a way, she wanted us to stay, because she always kept saying, well, "m your mother, you know. On the other hand, I think that she didn't want that Hans and I would become too close. And it turned out that she didn't want that Hans and any girl became too close. So Hans fell in love with a girl who came from the -- a social worker, who came from the East Indies. Her family came over -- she -- her family was invited over, the government invited them over to come. And Tante Toos was prejudiced against this girl. But this was the real girl, so they waited until she died, and then they got married.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And then got married?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Huh. Now you -- you write to your Uncle Alfred?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: In Roche -- they're in Rochester --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- did you know that -- you knew that they were in Rochester?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="75"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No. I wrote to New York City, and somehow --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: It got to them.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- it got there, and it's this American Distribution Committee. They were closely connected with them. It came out after they died, and my sister con -- correspondent that show that they have helped many Jews to -- to get out somehow.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And we didn't know a thing about that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, were you expecting when you wrote to your aunt and uncle, that they would somehow arrange for you to come to the United States?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You s -- you did. And did you want to come?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So then why did you write?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because my father told me to.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And is -- is Hedy too young to know what she wants, did she care that she go to the United States, or she stayed? Did it matter to her, do you think? Or she didn't care?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't think she wanted to go either. She had made some very good friends. And I was very much against it because, well I -- I-I could go back to school. I -- I had all my friends, except for [indecipherable] and -- and -- another thing, when -- when my uncle stayed with us, he was -- he was already married, but he was alone, so he was -- he didn't have too many worries on his mind at that time, except for waiting for his visa. And I was crazy about him, because he was a photographer, an amateur photographer, and he did beautiful work. And he did all his work himself, in our house, and he showed me what he was doing. And I was fascinated, I followed</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="76"></span> </p><p> him like a little doggie. And I was looking forward to seeing him again. It wasn't the same man any more.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But you, of course, didn't know this --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Didn't know that --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- un-until you -- until --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- I didn't know, and I didn't understand it either, and I was -- now I realize he was married, he had to keep a job. He came home very irritated often from her -- his job. He worked for an optical lens company as an engineer, and he was complaining that they would put the young whippersnappers in there who didn't know anything and didn't want to listen to what he had to say. He was very uptight. He was completely different from -- from what he was before.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So when you heard -- did you get a letter that you were going to go to the United States? Did you know that they were trying to get --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You -- you did.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So when you got the letter saying here are all the papers, you can come to the United States --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- did you want to just write and say, ah, we-we're not going to come? Or not?

I walked in the rain to school, and the top of my shoes were wet, and they were rubbing against the skin of my foot, and they were rubbing it open. And it just didn't heal. And I had to stay home, I had to keep my feet up. The doctor tried everything under the sun.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And it didn't heal?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It didn't heal for five months or something like that. And the last treatment I remember is that he put silver on it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Silver?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Mm-hm. I read that sometimes it's used, silver for healing.</p></p></dialogue>

And she's still a kid.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: She's still a kid. That's why it was so easy for her to call Uncle and Aunt Mom and Dad right away.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But you couldn't?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What kind of a ship was it that you were on?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: A French -- a converted French freighter. And the conversion was done in the place where all the luggage goes. What they did was they put beds in there. And i-in the middle was a -- a sort of -- it's almost look like a little podium. And on the one side we had the girls, on the other side we had the boys, and there were no curtains or anything, so that -- and the beds were two ba -- on top of each other. And -- and it was not -- we had no hot water, we had to wash with s-sea water.</p><p>Well, you can't wash with sea water. It doesn't -- it just doesn't --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: It doesn't work?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- work. And it was crowded, and we were not the only people. We -- we orphans were not the only refugees, there were more adult refugees from Poland, and even a professor from Holland who was not a refugee. He was going to teach at -- at Boston. And we had long discussions because downstairs it was no -- there was no ventilation. And so we stayed on that as long as we could, and -- that freighter, when they came to New York there was a big scandal and got into the papers that this ship was converted, but it certainly didn't have the standards that they were supposed to have. And the food was terrible, besides I was seasick, yeah, I didn't eat much. And -- and he was jailed, the captain was jailed.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was in the New York papers, I understand.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And why was he jailed, do you know?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because he -- he had this ship, and he took all these people, and he knew -- he was paid for, but he knew that he was way below the standard of a passenger ship.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How long were you on the ship?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="86"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Three weeks. After one week, one engine died. After two weeks, the second engine died. And we went on one engine this last part, and that's why it took so long.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So this wasn't a great introduction for you, was it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you s -- did you see the Statue of Liberty when you came in?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Was that nice to see? Was that important in some --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah, that is exciting.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It is?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because that is -- that seemed to us a symbol of the United States.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The United States, the freedom, justice. Now, we were standing there, crying.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Crying, yes? And was Hedy okay? Was she well by then, by the time you --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: She was okay. And did she see the Statue of Liberty, too?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But I don't think she was impressed by it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But you were?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah. And were a lot of people standing outside --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh yes, almost everyone. That was the end of the trip.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. And who was there to greet you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="87"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My aunt. My uncle was there, but he couldn't wait for three weeks. He -- they couldn't take three weeks off from work, so he had to go back to work.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So she waited for three weeks?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because that ship was supposed to come at a certain date, and it didn't, and she stayed.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We stayed in a hotel after that, but she had friends in -- in New York, and I suppose she stayed with them before we came.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But when you came she went to a hotel with you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you then take a bath?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, and we learned a lot of things that are different.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Like what?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Like in -- i-i-in the Netherlands, in the wintertime it gets m -- humid and cold, and people wear woolen underwear and longjohns. And [indecipherable] will wear woolen panties. And she told us to forget about all that, because we were going to be living in centrally heated houses or buildings, and we would be -- we would not be needing that kind of underwear any more. And she told us about deodorant. We didn't have any. I guess it wasn't necessary.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But now you were supposed to use it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. And she told us about putting hand lotion on after you -- after you wash your hands, so your skin doesn't get rough. And I think she told us, never go barefoot on the floor, because you get athlete's foot. We never heard of that.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="88"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So is this all before you get to Rochester?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: She's giving you all these little lessons. But you remember her from when she was at your apartment.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: She was just -- yeah, she was just one night.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Just one night in your apartment?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see. But did you recognize her when you saw her?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You did.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: She looked the same?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Pretty much.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you like her, were you comfortable with her?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: N-N-No, not at the beginning.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because -- it's a story again.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's fine.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Tante Annie had sent me from Vienna, a scarf and a very nice little automatic pencil. Little, dainty, very nice. And she came when she saw me, and she said, you never wrote me a thank you letter. I felt so bad. This was the greeting.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That was the first thing she said?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And I thought she was awful. Yeah.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="89"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And that's what you remembered about her.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's what -- that's the only thing I remembered from [indecipherable]. And then -- yeah, that's all I remembered, and I didn't really know her at all. And she didn't know us, and she had a difficult job. And, you know, in retrospect, they never had any kids.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So here comes a 10 year old and an 18 year old.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And an 18 year old Dutch. And I was always called the stubborn Dutch girl, always. Hedy is stubborn.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But you were called stubborn?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But I -- I was called the stubborn Dutch girl.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you stubborn?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: A little bit, but not to -- not of -- much more than anybody else.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm. How -- how old -- do you know how old they were when you came? Were they much older? Were they in their 50's or 60's?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No. I think they were -- there was six years between them. She must have been maybe 39, and he was in his middle 40's --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I see.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- would guess.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was she warm to you at all?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Very much so.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: She was?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. And she had written letters to us in Holland --  <span class="page-break" number="90"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- before we came. And in the letters she was very, very warm, yeah. And she -- she -- she was warm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm. So did you come to like her very much? Or was that difficult?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was difficult. One thing is that I already had most of my manners, and some -- my personality was pretty well formed. I mean, it was not that you couldn't change anything, but it was mo -- more difficult to work with an 18 year old than with a 10.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And I -- they always had something to say, everything was wrong. They wanted me to be a perfect American girl, the all American girl, one, two, three. Hair different, dress different, everything.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So this was difficult for you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Mm. It was not difficult for Hedy. She fit right in. I didn't want to have them harp on me all the time, and they were. They wanted to turn me into a very attractive American girl, which I wasn't.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you say anything to them?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I did not. And that I had left over from the war. I felt if I would start saying something, they would throw us out. And they wouldn't have, but that was in my mind. One time, when I said -- contradicted Tante Anne, Uncle Alfred came flying down the stairs. How did you dare to contradict your Aunt Annie? That was the first time that I had said something, I forgot what.</p><p>Yeah, they became quite desperate with me, and I was put in the senior year of the high school, so I could have the American diploma, things would be easier for me. And they wanted me to tell them what I wanted to become, what life work I had chosen. I had no idea. And they had me go</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="91"></span> </p><p> to different technical schools, and they told them they -- they told the school principal they didn't know what to do with me any more, and the counselor. And there was a school psychologist who gave me a couple of tests. And they told me -- they told them to send me to college.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Wait a minute, say this again, they what? The -- they -- the --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: This -- they told me to send them -- to send --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Send you to college?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- me to college. The college was right behind the high school that I went to. There was -- and -- and not to worry, and send her to college.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did that make you feel good?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. Of course, I didn't know exactly what college would be like, because in the Netherlands, when you graduate from the secondary school, you go to the university. You are a student already, you are almost a grown up. And a college here is not yet for grown ups. But I liked it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What sort of culture shock was there for you in coming to the United States?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: All the food you could eat, all the bananas everywhere. All these pastries all over the place.</p><p>The automatic [indecipherable] we had a little bit of that in Amsterdam, one little spot which [indecipherable] was a great big automatic thing, and oh, I had never seen that before. You've got -- you know. And so many people in the streets, and so -- s-so humid and so hot. That was terrible, I ca -- I'm still not used to it. It was -- that was New York in September, and it was hot.</p><p>And di -- the department stores, the size of the department stores, there ha -- there are department stores in Holland, but the gigantic sizes here of everything. And I still think so when I come in</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="92"></span> </p><p> from winter, the distances are bigger, everything is so big and wide. And the other culture shock part of it was that I was -- I couldn't speak too well yet, but I heard what all the other girls were saying [indecipherable]. They were saying, oh I'm so tired, oh I'm so tired. I got to say that later too, but at that time -- and then they were talking about, did you see him? He asked me out for Saturday, and did you see her clothes? They didn't fit at all. Well, I -- I couldn't understand how 16 - 17 year old girls could talk like that. They are more mature in Holland. They were. Things have changed.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But at that time, when you were 16 - 17, you were pretty serious student, no matter where you were. And you -- and you don't talk about somebody else's clothes, or -- or guys, or -- yeah, guys of course, once in awhile, but not all the time. And they never talked about a book they had read, or more serious things. And I could not -- I could not understand it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you understand it now?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. Well, I see where they're coming from.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And I think some of them have become more serious, some of the teenagers, because of the conditions we find ourselves in now. They realize it. But, of course, that was a pretty golden time for the States, 1950 -- 1946 - 1947. They had everything they wanted.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you very unhappy when you came here, and stayed in wa -- Rochester? Did that make you unhappy?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [had no say over it. It was the only thing we could do. No, it didn't make me happy, but I -- but what were we going to do? We had to do what Uncle and Aunt told us to.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="93"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [know they had a difficult job, but they really left me with the feeling that I am not smart enough, I don't work fast enough, I -- if I don't have a date calling back it's my fault. And after I left the house and went to private school, what did they say to my sister? Why don't you study?</p><p>Betsy always studied. Why don't you do this well? Betsy always did that well.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: That's what they said --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: To Hedy.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- to Hedy.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: After I left the house, and I was in Cleveland then.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And did Hedy tell you that --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- this was what they were saying? You must have been shocked.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, I was. It -- it even worked in -- in college. It just so happened the French professor liked me, and -- and Hedy didn't s -- ma -- she didn't work as seriously, maybe. I don't know how she worked, I wasn't there. But Hedy told me that my French professor told her, what's the matter of you? You're Betsy's sister, why -- why can't you learn that? All that happened afterward, but it's already done damage.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did -- did you ever tell them, later on, when you were no longer in the house, what it felt like?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>Or you never did?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I never did.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: They also told you not to speak about your experiences, am I correct?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: True.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What did they tell you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="94"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, don't tell anybody, because nobody will understand. Nobody who didn't go through these things personally, they don't have any idea what you're talking about. They won't understand it.</p><p>You may as well not talk about it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did they ask you? So you told them what happened? Di -- I mean, did they ask you to explain what had happened to you during the war? To them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Uncle and Aunt?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So they knew.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not an awful lot.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They wanted me to forget about it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. It was said to a lot of people who came, wasn't it? Don't talk about it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I think so.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't know anybody else to whom it was said.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh. Did that make you feel bad?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes. Well, I wasn't going to shout it around. I wasn't going to make that a subject of a discussion. Didn't have to tell me that, but the fact that I really wasn't supposed to --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- yeah, it bothered me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did -- did people at school as you what happened during the war, or was it as if -- I don't know, the war happened to other people, it was never the people that you were me -- do you  <span class="page-break" number="95"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> know what I mean? It was if it was a blank time. So did any of the students say to you, you were in the Netherlands, what happened? No. Not the teachers? Nobody?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Nobody.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So di -- did you keep thinking about it, or did you also try to get rid of it in some -- in some way?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I didn't try to get rid of it, but I didn't wa -- I wasn't preoccupied with it any more at all. I was -- I became preoccupied with the school work.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And no, I wasn't. My father -- I missed my father all along.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: More than your mother, it was your father that you kept thinking about?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Mm-hm. I missed him awfully much. It wasn't until I got married that -- that that stopped.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It stopped. And you met your husband in Cleveland when you were going to school?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And did he ask you about it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: He did.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But that was not so good, because now I don't like going over the border, being asked where I'm going.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You don't like to a -- you don't like to be to -- asked where you're going.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Where I'm going, wh-where -- who am I visiting. That's what we are asked at the border.</p><p>And on the way back, what did you bring, who gave you something, what was it, what was the value? I don't like that. And that is from the war.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It reminds you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="96"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. Hm. We have to change the tape.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>End of Tape Six  <span class="page-break" number="97"></span> </p><p> Beginning Tape Seven</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Betsy, when -- when did you actually start talking about your experiences during the war?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>Only in the f-family, or did you talk in di -- in other places?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I did a little bit in college, because people would ask, where were you during the war -- the Jewish people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: So I told them I was hidden during the war. Just Jewish people. And my doctor in Windsor somehow knew about it through Roseanne because he's ro -- my daughter --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- he's her doctor, too, and he -- he went down and sat with me and wanted to know everything, before, you know, he became [indecipherable] and wanted to know how it was and how I felt. Yes, in college I didn't do much about. I told you I spoke at the PTA meeting once, but I -- yes, I was asked to speak at the PTA meeting when I was in high school, but I was asked to speak about Holland. So I had to do research because things had changed already.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So I spoke about Holland, but not about my experiences.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you -- when you -- when your kids were born -- you have three children, did you -- when they reached a certain age, did you tell them about your experiences? Or only when they were older?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, they all knew about it, but gee, I don't remember if I told them, or my husband. They all had different reactions, though. No, I don't think I went down and sa -- and told them, like you know, like we are talking.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="98"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. No. But then the boys got older and they started asking more questions and then I gave them more answers.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. But you say that they all have different reactions. What are the -- what are the different reactions that they have?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Jack is very interested in the experiences. He also wants to see where I went to grade school.</p><p>He wants to see the house we were in, and the Germans next door. And by the way, in that house, in the front room under the floor are still several jars of jam that my mother put there, but she never had the chance to get them out. And if nobody changed that floor, they are still there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: They are still there. This is the original, the -- the house that you grew up in?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, that was the house where we lived before the hiding.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh, right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah. The offices were downstairs, and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- I don't -- I don't think she had any help, I think she did that all by herself. Cut -- cut the piece out of the floor and put the --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Put the jam in. Why did she put it there?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, you were not supposed to horde any more, so that was one reason. And she wanted to have it, though. She thought it was important to have.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm. Hm. And Roseanne, what's her response?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't want to be Jewish any more, because I don't want to go to a concentration camp.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Now that was all the way through, all the way through until maybe just a year ago. She has a 10 year old daughter who sings in a choir, and the choir is the Windsor [indecipherable] opera</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="99"></span> </p><p> choir, so everybody's in there. And Roseanne thought around Christmastime there were too many songs about Jesus. And she told them so. She said, I don't do Christmas, I am Jewish. You shouldn't just think -- but Roseanne has a way of saying things [indecipherable] make angry. So now she's got to come to a meeting, there are going to be board members there of that opera situation. Now, that's the first time that she has come forward to say that she's Jewish. Before that, she didn't want to have anything to do with it. She didn't even look for Jewish guys ever, ever. She had two bad marriages. Mark, that's the middle one.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's your son, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He was very interested. He was very interested. He went to Israel when he graduated from college and he stopped in Amsterdam. My cousin was still alive, my cousin Betsy. And he wanted her to take him to the old [indecipherable] synagogue there that I-I even haven't seen.</p><p>And he wanted to know a lot about the time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But he has become ultra-Orthodox, and so now he's more interested in making me Orthodox.</p><p>But he has the empathy. He definitely has the empathy.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm, for your experience, uh-huh, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. He is a very sensitive person, he ought to be a social worker or a psychologist, but he cleans the shule.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm. And he lives in Israel? He lives in Israel?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: With eight children.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Eight?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="100"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Mm-hm. He lives in -- on the West Bank, the disputed territory. And I'm the mother, so excuse me, but I think Mark is very smart.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: He's very smart?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So is Jack.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But Mark is in a different way. He seems to pick it up out of the air. He was good student, and he's just that smart.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So let me ask you, you -- you were not feeling very much Jewish identity during the war.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What about after the war?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Passover?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No, after the war.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: After the war?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, e-everything changed. All I knew was matzoh at Passover, no bread. And not going to school during the high holidays, Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. And that's all I knew. Oh, I also knew that Jews sometimes ate different foods, but I didn't know how different until we came to the States and Uncle and Aunt -- Uncle being Mother's brother, being family of Schwartz's [indecipherable] was pretty religious. And they belonged to the Conservative synagogue. And we had to stay home from school and go to all the services.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So was this part of your culture shock?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. What disappointed me was that the women had to sit on the balcony, and there was no air conditioning, and it was September in Rochester and it was hot. I thought I'd die. And so there</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="101"></span> </p><p> was so much Hebrew. I hadn't learned any Hebrew. Now I'm beginning to feel I should know more, but at that time, they talk Hebrew, well, I was daydreaming.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did they send you to Hebrew school?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: They didn't.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You mean in Holland?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In Rochester, when you moved there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: No. Did they send ha --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Neither of you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But Hedy became a Sunday school teacher in the Reform synagogue because she got to know some guy. And so he got -- she became a Sunday school teacher, so she learned very much more about Judaism quickly, where she start keeping to everything. And like I said, with Uncle and Aunt, I learned -- bagels were new, bagels I had never heard of. And -- and -- and smoked he -- smoked salmon, I didn't know anything about. And such thing as [indecipherable], which my husband's sister make very good [indecipherable] and I -- I had never, never seen that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you like it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. And the only way you could eat matzohs in Holland was with butter and sugar over it.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="102"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Butter and sugar?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. Very fine sugar. Not powdered sugar, a sugar in between. And that does taste good.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really? Pll try it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So do you think that in s -- that because of being in this household where it was more religious than you grew up, that you became more identified with je -- with Judaism, or it's just that you were -- it was clear you were Jewish and that was it? Were -- did you -- did you go to synagogue more once you were --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes, I did.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And the reason why I did, and especially [indecipherable] they had Rabbi Phil Bernstein, and Philip Bernstein wrote a book which is called, ""What do Jews Believe?" It wa -- it was a long time ago, but it was a bestseller. And his sermons were just out of this world. So I went out of my own will, I went every Friday in my last year of college, cause he was inspiring.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, that's interesting.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And when you got married, did you go to synagogue? Or did you send your kids to synagogue?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We always landed in a neighborhood that was far from the Jewish community, because we moved around a lot. And even in Windsor, I lived in Windsor east, the Jews lived in Windsor south, but we couldn't afford the homes there. So the children were really not exposed much, except that we sent Jack and Mark to Sunday school in Mansfield at the time, which was about 12 miles away from us, Mansfield, Ohio. And Jack was ready to be Bar-Mitzvahed, but he didn't</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="103"></span> </p><p> want to be Bar-Mitzvahed. And when Mark was in college, he became almost a born again Christian. He happened to have a friend who was, and his friend's mother and I met through unusual circumstances and became close friends. But she got Mark. She got them to go with her to Washington to the Peace March and all the things that they do. And my husband said, I don't like that. And then my husband read in the Jewish news that there was going to be some kind of Jewish meeting in New York City, but you didn't know how Jewish. So he went there, and he met Rabbi Hecht. Rabbi Hecht was very ultra-Orthodox, and he was -- his work was to reach out to the students. And he got Mark. And now Mark is Orthodox.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And it's really unusual because we -- we didn't have mu-much contact with Jewish people when we -- in Cleveland, yeah. But then, when we had to move to those small communities, there were hardly any Jews. And it was a hardship to take him every Sunday to Sunday school, especially if one of them didn't want to. So Roseanne was not very much -- we couldn't show her very mu -- didn't show her very much. But she had her own reasons for not wanting to be Jewish, you know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right, right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: So that's how it worked with the kids. I think Jack identifies with us as being Jewish, but he wanted to show his daughter what the high holidays were like, and he brought her to a synagogue in L.A., and they told him you can't come in unless you pay 500 dollars. That was --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And that was the end. Have you ever talked about your experiences to schoolchildren, have you ever been invited to do that, or wanted to do it?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. But the Jewish center got to know about me through Mark, who was a -- a member there, active member. A-An -- and -- and -- and about my -- he talked about my background, and they</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="104"></span> </p><p> have a Yom HaShoah -- they have a few days ago in the Conservative synagogue, the Reform, and there's little one, ultra-Orthodox. And some [indecipherable] in town, and they have some kind of ceremony where we have to -- the -- the survivors have to go up on the stage, and they have to turn on a candle. And they don't say who they are -- we are, but we are the survivors, and so I was called by the Jewish Center to take part.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Are you pleased that there is so much publicity about the Holocaust now that -- that there are more programs on television, that there's more written about it than when you first came?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You are.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: What upsets me now is that there are people who still don't believe.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm. How do you think this experience has affected you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It's going to affect me?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No. How has it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That I was very angry, cause it was the -- the minister of one of the western provinces who said -- he was Dutch -- it never happened. An-And -- and he s -- he was -- made anti-Semitic speeches, but when he said it never happened, I was thinking, what can I do about that? Yeah, I didn't like that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When -- when you think about your life now, and you think about what it was like for you in the Netherlands because of the war, and because you were in hiding, do you think that changed you very much?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you think it affected you a great deal?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="105"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And -- and how -- how would you explain what it did to you? Do -- do you know?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I knew that Tante Toos's brother-in-law said, get rid of them. And I just figured if -- if we would make trouble, and -- and make things difficult for Tante Toos in some way, like my mom did at times, we would be thrown out on the street.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And that feeling has been with me all the time. I don't want to antagonize people because I'm afraid they"! throw me out on the street.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you don't want to fight, you don't want to argue.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. And -- and -- and my kids are the opposite, all three. They say what -- what they think. I don't.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Still you -- you still don't.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Actu -- I say what I think, but if it's going to make friction, I don't.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You don't.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. And like I said, I don't like border inspection.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Stuff like that. And I also horde. Once in awhile Windsor cannot sell a product and slowly it will go off the shelves. And when I notice that, and it is something that I'm using, I horde.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So what are you hoarding now?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: 1 -- [have a couple of pieces of Caress soap. They took that off the Windsor market, but I understand it's still [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right, it's here. Shall we send you some?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh no.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="106"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [still have about five big pieces.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh. Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That should go me awhile.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you think that the -- do you think that the war harmed you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You know how isolated I felt, and now, afterward, I'm -- I'm just very shy. I'm not aggressive, I'm not self assertive at all because for one, I -- I don't bump and rock the boat. And for another, I want the other person to show me first, how -- what they mean, are they really friendly, or are they just putting it on?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And for you that -- you think that comes from the war, not from before?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, I think so.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think so because Hitler made it so obvious that there are Jews who did everything wrong.</p><p>And before the war, to me, the Jews weren't any different from anybody else.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [had Jewish friends and I had Christian friends, and there were -- well, first my mom of course, would -- I didn't accept it from her really, but then when Hitler came, you couldn't help it any more.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You had to believe her then, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And the name was Cohen, too.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Who was Cohen?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was Cohen.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="107"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you couldn't avoid it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: No. This is --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Is there anything that you would like to say that we haven't talked about?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, I -- I should say that you should not judge a person too quickly. That -- yeah. Wait and see more of his personality aspect before you make a judgment. That's what I want to say.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay. Well, Betsy, thank you so much. We spent a number of times on the telephone and I'm so glad that you were able to come to Washington and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh, thank you.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- and be with us. Thank you very much.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So thank you to you and to Jack. Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
