<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What kind of a ship was it that you were on?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: A French -- a converted French freighter. And the conversion was done in the place where all the luggage goes. What they did was they put beds in there. And i-in the middle was a -- a sort of -- it's almost look like a little podium. And on the one side we had the girls, on the other side we had the boys, and there were no curtains or anything, so that -- and the beds were two ba -- on top of each other. And -- and it was not -- we had no hot water, we had to wash with s-sea water.</p><p>Well, you can't wash with sea water. It doesn't -- it just doesn't --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: It doesn't work?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- work. And it was crowded, and we were not the only people. We -- we orphans were not the only refugees, there were more adult refugees from Poland, and even a professor from Holland who was not a refugee. He was going to teach at -- at Boston. And we had long discussions because downstairs it was no -- there was no ventilation. And so we stayed on that as long as we could, and -- that freighter, when they came to New York there was a big scandal and got into the papers that this ship was converted, but it certainly didn't have the standards that they were supposed to have. And the food was terrible, besides I was seasick, yeah, I didn't eat much. And -- and he was jailed, the captain was jailed.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was in the New York papers, I understand.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And why was he jailed, do you know?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because he -- he had this ship, and he took all these people, and he knew -- he was paid for, but he knew that he was way below the standard of a passenger ship.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Like what?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Like in -- i-i-in the Netherlands, in the wintertime it gets m -- humid and cold, and people wear woolen underwear and longjohns. And [indecipherable] will wear woolen panties. And she told us to forget about all that, because we were going to be living in centrally heated houses or buildings, and we would be -- we would not be needing that kind of underwear any more. And she told us about deodorant. We didn't have any. I guess it wasn't necessary.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But now you were supposed to use it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah. And she told us about putting hand lotion on after you -- after you wash your hands, so your skin doesn't get rough.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was difficult. One thing is that I already had most of my manners, and some -- my personality was pretty well formed.

Of course, I didn't know exactly what college would be like, because in the Netherlands, when you graduate from the secondary school, you go to the university. You are a student already, you are almost a grown up. And a college here is not yet for grown ups. But I liked it.</p></p></dialogue>

And the other culture shock part of it was that I was -- I couldn't speak too well yet, but I heard what all the other girls were saying [indecipherable]. They were saying, oh I'm so tired, oh I'm so tired. I got to say that later too, but at that time -- and then they were talking about, did you see him? He asked me out for Saturday, and did you see her clothes? They didn't fit at all. Well, I -- I couldn't understand how 16 - 17 year old girls could talk like that. They are more mature in Holland.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But at that time, when you were 16 - 17, you were pretty serious student, no matter where you were. And you -- and you don't talk about somebody else's clothes, or -- or guys, or -- yeah, guys of course, once in awhile, but not all the time. And they never talked about a book they had read, or more serious things. And I could not -- I could not understand it.</p></p></dialogue>

You shouldn't just think -- but Roseanne has a way of saying things [indecipherable] make angry. So now she's got to come to a meeting, there are going to be board members there of that opera situation. Now, that's the first time that she has come forward to say that she's Jewish. Before that, she didn't want to have anything to do with it. She didn't even look for Jewish guys ever, ever. She had two bad marriages. Mark, that's the middle one.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So do you think that in s -- that because of being in this household where it was more religious than you grew up, that you became more identified with je -- with Judaism, or it's just that you were -- it was clear you were Jewish and that was it?

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And the reason why I did, and especially [indecipherable] they had Rabbi Phil Bernstein, and Philip Bernstein wrote a book which is called, ""What do Jews Believe?" It wa -- it was a long time ago, but it was a bestseller. And his sermons were just out of this world. So I went out of my own will, I went every Friday in my last year of college, cause he was inspiring.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We always landed in a neighborhood that was far from the Jewish community, because we moved around a lot. And even in Windsor, I lived in Windsor east, the Jews lived in Windsor south, but we couldn't afford the homes there. So the children were really not exposed much, except that we sent Jack and Mark to Sunday school in Mansfield at the time, which was about 12 miles away from us, Mansfield, Ohio.

And when Mark was in college, he became almost a born again Christian. He happened to have a friend who was, and his friend's mother and I met through unusual circumstances and became close friends. But she got Mark. She got them to go with her to Washington to the Peace March and all the things that they do. And my husband said, I don't like that. And then my husband read in the Jewish news that there was going to be some kind of Jewish meeting in New York City, but you didn't know how Jewish. So he went there, and he met Rabbi Hecht. Rabbi Hecht was very ultra-Orthodox, and he was -- his work was to reach out to the students. And he got Mark. And now Mark is Orthodox.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And it's really unusual because we -- we didn't have mu-much contact with Jewish people when we -- in Cleveland, yeah. But then, when we had to move to those small communities, there were hardly any Jews. And it was a hardship to take him every Sunday to Sunday school, especially if one of them didn't want to. So Roseanne was not very much -- we couldn't show her very mu -- didn't show her very much. But she had her own reasons for not wanting to be Jewish, you know.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: So that's how it worked with the kids.

That was --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And that was the end. Have you ever talked about your experiences to schoolchildren, have you ever been invited to do that, or wanted to do it?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. But the Jewish center got to know about me through Mark, who was a -- a member there, active member.
