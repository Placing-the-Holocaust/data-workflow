<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. I think all the time, and -- and especially with -- with Father in the military uniform also. It was -- it was always present. I can't recall any particular talks about it, but -- but you know, they -- they lived through the period when Poland was born, so for them it was very important. And they were patriots, both of them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What about church? Did they go to church regularly?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now again, this is probably not fair -- a -- a fair question to somebody who was six and seven years old at the time, but I'm curious. In Ledz, which is a rather large city, there were -- there was a large Jewish population as well. And did you know of -- did you know that there were people who were Jews? Did you have any Jews who were neighbors? Did that -- did the Jewish world ever, in any way, come across into your world?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But -- right, but I don't remember any kind of a anti-something, an anti- somebody talks, because my mother was going with -- with girls that were of German origin and I'm sure they went with the -- with the Jewish girls, and then so -- but I don't remember particular that -- like if there was a Jew that was visiting us, for example, no.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, I'm thinking, did you ever go to streets that were -- maybe the baker, or there would be a tailor, or you would see like streets that would be particularly, you know, more Jewish, in the Jewish section of town, or -- or neighbors who might be around.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah. Did you know -- did you have a sense -- now again, this may not be a fair question because I'm asking it of somebody who was seven at the time, but did you have a sense that there were others, people who were not Polish in the city, or is that something you learned or knew about later?

And so he had rented a -- a -- part of a villa on a hill. So in order to -- to go to the town, you had to go down the hill and -- and th -- and walk to the town, because it wasn't too far away.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: As far as I was concerned, it was a beautiful summer. My -- my father, you know, worked and I --I do remember, I think that -- that he took us on one of the -- he had to visit the camp where he was training th-the kids, and -- and we did go with him to -- to visit that. I don't recall the details, but then I remember that we went.</p><p>And you know, it -- the -- the area, which of course loc-located in -- in the part where many people were Ukrainian, White Russians, Jews -- again, you know, because that's -- that's the way it was in Poland, all -- all over the place.

And he also said that if we wanted to visit him, he will permit us to get in, provided it's four o'clock in the morning.</p></p></dialogue>

Then -- and then of course, th -- right then from the very beginning, the -- the kind of terror started, where you wouldn't be able to talk to anybody freely. You -- you would -- you know, it was -- it -- you could feel that everybody is kind of backing off, you know, I'm not going to say anything, and you know, that's the way it was, because you couldn't trust anyone any more. And of course, like everywhere else, there were -- there were a lot of communists, Polish communists or Ukrainian communists or Jewish communists. And those people would -- did go into cooperation, so you already didn't know who you can trust. We apparently trusted my -- you know, the landlord, because then he didn't -- didn't kick us out or anything like that, so, you know, must have been a very kind and good person to permit that.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I--I- she was apparently a strong character. And so somehow she accepted that, you know, and when she was born and -- until 1914, that part of Poland was under Russian occupation, all -- you know. And so she was not shocked by -- by, you know, being under Russians again somehow.</p></p></dialogue>

She did learn some sp -- some French, and -- when she was in school, but apparently she had enough to get by when we were finally required to speak Russian. But -- but she did not become fluent, you know. Probably enough words to -- to get by. And the Russians and Polish are very similar, so you could really understand without having to really learn the language. And that's the way she was.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. So your contact w-with the Russian military authorities sounds like it was rather minimal. It was when they came -- the doctor came to look at your father's wound, and then your father left, and -- I should say Soviet military authorities, not Russian military authorities.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: All right. So what happens in April? And what date in April?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Then we -- then the first deportation from the Polish territories occurred in -- in February -- in February. And so we were aware of the fact that people were being deported. And of course, you never knew who was going to be the next one. But then on -- on April 13" at night, another -- three o'clock, four o'clock in the morning or something like that, a banging sounded at the door, and the Russian troops came in, and th -- we were ordered to pack within half an hour, and we're being taken away.

This is what you have, and that's all?</p><p>And so it wasn't something that the people start sa -- you know, telling jokes, and laughing, you -- you know. It was -- it was rather silent. And I remember when -- when we came to the border, and we had to move to the Russian trains, because the Russian railroad system was wired in Polish. So th -- we couldn't use Polish trains any more. So we were reloaded, and kept going east. And then realized that we are being sent, you know, into the territory of the so -- Soviet Union. So it --I don't remember how it -- how long it took, but it probably took several weeks for us to finally travel almost to -- to the Ural Mountains, just a -- towards the -- towards the -- with -- on the south of the Ural Mountains, and -- and the -- and the -- and the steppe begins, the -- the plains.</p></p></dialogue>

And in general, in Russian -- in Russia that's what you -- if you're lucky, you eat bread, not like this one in here, but -- but you were lucky if you -- if you got, you know, a hundred grams of bread a day.

So they became a part of this group that lush -- Russians, as they say, pacified them by transporting them into the Kazakhstan.

You just simply, you know -- and you don't want to -- anybody to know, because then you became a -- a -- an enemy of the people. So, you know -- but everybody knew, of course, that we are the enemies, because once we were deported, that means that you are the enemy. And -- but -- but -- but the locals were understanding.

What about the summer of 1941? Where -- in June 1941, the Soviet Union is attacked by Nazi Germany. Did you find out about that in this remote, remote place?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Apparently yes, later on, because you know the -- th-the newspapers would arrive there from time to time, and th-they would learn from the Russians we would -- we would find out. But it wasn't until later, of course, that it came to us somehow, you know, through word of mouth or whatever, is that -- that there -- once the Russians were attacked, and the Germans were moving very rapidly, th-the Russians somehow managed to make contact with the -- with the west, with the British and the Americans. And they formed a ali-alliance all of a sudden. And so, because they -- they couldn't have enough equipment, you know, so the -- so the British and the Americans started supplying them with -- with the military equipment. And at that time, of course, the -- the relationships between the Soviet Union and the Polish government was broken in 1939, and we didn't have any mu -- a-any diplomat relations with -- with them at all.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Wa -- explain how there could be a Polish government, where was it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, in -- in 1939, as I told you, there were people, hundreds of people, thousands of people moving out of Poland, going -- going south. The Polish government also left. And from -- from Hungary they were then transported to  <span class="page-break" number="60"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Witold Pawlikowski 4 January 21, 2015 France, and they f-- reformed as a -- as a new government representing different political parties. Then es-established this -- themselves in France, and they started building up Polish military, because there were a lot of people that were escaping.</p><p>And that -- they somehow managed to escape then from -- from -- from Romania and from Hungary, where they were -- they were interned, because those countries were -- were in -- were -- what do you call it? Were not participating in war, they were -- they were neutral. So they -- by the thousands they just run different ways.</p><p>You know, the -- the roads opened to Italy and -- and all kinds of places.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So this is where your father had hoped to be able to land.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's what he was hoping, that he's going to -- to end up. And so they formed military units in France. And then, of course, when France was attacked, they did give up even sooner than -- than Poland did. And since we had an alliance with -- with the British, the British had evacuated Polish troops from France, into England. And this -- so the Polish government had reestablished itself in England, and upon British insistence, the Soviet Union, because I don't know exactly what -- what was the -- the -- the words, but they said, you know, okay, we'll -- we" ll qui -- give you equipment, but you know, you got -- you -- you telling us to open the second front, you know, we not quite ready yet.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So it's the Americans and the British who are saying this to the Soviets?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right. They said, you know, wis--we'll help you, but -- but you know, you saying that you don't have enough troops, and blah-blah-blah-blah, this or this. But you know, you have -- you have maybe couple hundred thousand troops that you have arrested when you came into Poland. Because that's what happened, you know, because the units that were located in -- in the east, they were all, you know, taken over by the Russians, and by the thousands they were deported to Russia.</p><p>And as you probably know, the -- the -- many of the officers and -- and a -- and a -- leading classes, like judges and teachers and things, they were -- they were arrested by the thousands by the Soviets. And -- and then the Polish officer corps, at -- at least they know about 20,000 that were killed in Katyn, which was several times where they decided to liquidate the Polish military prisoners of war, which was against, you know, the Geneva Conference, of course. But they killed 14,000 that was known, that -- that were -- that -- that were killed.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't know.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So, in other words, they had the pact. There were several pacts going on.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right.

Before we get to that, I want to know, did your -- did you make friends, did your mother make friends with other Poles while -- or other people while she was in the Soviet Union? You had mentioned before that people were very distrustful, and kept a distance between themselves. Was there ever any exception to that, when people bridged the gap?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, in a way, but you know, it -- it wasn't -- it wasn't a friendship.

So when -- when this group of Poles in our village and o-other places heard that, they all got together and they decided to move south towards where the army was being formed.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So how were you going to do that? How did they do that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We were transported to -- to this -- to the railroad station, I don't know how, how they managed this I have no idea, but the transport was formed and we were moved to the railroad station, loaded on a train. And the train, I think it was like six weeks that we were on the train. Again, the cattle car, and so we were moving from one place to another, until we went to -- through Tashkent(ph), the place that my grandfather was -- was in, and we went through Bukhara(ph) and I -- I don't know how many other places.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, because we were free citizens to move about. Which is, you know, very unusual in the Soviet Union. And so, in traveling all these -- these distances, we finally ended up where they decided to unload us because the railroad wheels were being abused, you know, so we had to discharge. And they moved us to a kolkhoz called Frumza(ph).</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So this was a collective farm called Frumza(ph)?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: The other lady died. The son was 15 or 16 at that time, older than I was, and so my mother, you know, took care of him.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Right.

We don't know. Because this kind of documentation you simply do not get from that system. There, nobody knows anything. And as -- it's much easier that way. And you know, it -- to me, right now, it doesn't make any difference. I know that he perished. So what else can you do? But, you know, it's -- it's something that you have to live with, and something that you must realize, that this is what happened, that you have gone through some unusual circumstances, and -- and you have to live, because if you don't, if you think about it all the time, you can really hurt yourself quite a bit. So that's why me -- maybe I have forgotten some of these things, maybe purposely, I don't know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: That's --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: But you know -- but it's one of those -- those things, and what difference does it make where he is, and if I -- if I could find his grave or something? It's 50 some years, you know, he's gone. And you know, I -- I d--I know he's gone and I know that he's perished at the -- you know, in the territories of the Soviet Union and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- that's satisfactory to me.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="78"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Witold Pawlikowski * January 21, 2015</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did you find that when you were s -- when you were already -- had you already left the Soviet Union, or before, your mother?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, I think it was already in -- in Teheran that she found out, right. And we have never -- there was nev -- never a trace of him, you know, somebody coming out that knew him from the prison or something. Nothing. Just gone. So I -- I suppose he must have died soon after he was deported, you know, and probably from the wound, because it wasn't healed, at that time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell me a little bit about your journey from Almata(ph) to actually leaving the Soviet Union. What was that like?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, first of all, you know, once we were under the protection of -- of the military, we began to be fed.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The Polish military. Even though -- even still in Kazakhstan?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: In-- in -- still in-- in Uzbekistan because Almaty(ph) is in --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Uzbekistan.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- Uzbekistan.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, so -- so our survival was -- the possibility of survival was much, much better terms. And then, as I said before, the -- the Russians didn't want to -- to arm the Polish military, because it was -- you know, something that they just don't do.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="79"></span> Interview with Witold Pawlikowski *8 January 21, 2015</p><p> You do not arm the enemies, who become now friends, and so -- so they were still asking Americans and British to open up the front, and -- and they said, well you have -- you have the Polish army, you have over 100,000 troops, you know, why don't you arm them? Oh, we don't have anything to do. So the British said, well, then you release them. Let us take care of them, let us arm them, and they can become a part of the second front when we finally open it. So, by miracle I suppose, Uncle Stalin decided that yes, okay, we will do that. And we were released. And so military started moving [indecipherable] troops.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So the first -- the first thought had not been to release all of -- not -- not allow anybody to leave the territory, but just grou -- regroup and form a military unit.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's what -- that's what even the Poles wanted to do, because of what -- they wanted to fight for Poland, you know, as when the Russians are --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- going to start pressing westward, they will part of the -- of that system. But the Russians didn't trust them, because they were all anti-Soviet. Many of them had -- had fought in the -- in the war of 1920, when the Soviets started pushing into Poland, and were defeated, luckily. So -- so the -- all these troops were enemies.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And also the -- the -- you know, nobody knew about Katyn yet. Nobody knew at that point.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="80"></span> Interview with Witold Pawlikowski "4 January 21, 2015</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. Not -- not yet.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. And so -- so the -- the relationship was lukewarm at best. And I suppose they really wanted to get rid of those people too, because there -- there would -- you know, there would -- th-they were like a -- like -- like a foreign organism within the system, you know, and th-there were -- there were -- y-you know -- I -- I remember there's a little story that one of the units, I don't know which one it was, because I had it -- I heard a story about it. But they were being formed and a -- and then local people have come to -- to this unit, and they said, do you -- do you -- do you play this -- this hymn that -- that is being played by -- by the trumpet? And -- and guy says what -- oh, what a -- what a di -- this single trumpeteer sings this song, you know, di -- plays this song. And all of a sudden this -- this guy realizes that in the city of Krakow there is a-- there is a--a church with a -- with a spire on it. And in--in 14 -- in 1200 some, when -- when the Tartars and -- and Turks s-started moving towards Poland, they came to that town. And the guy being at the top of the -- of -- of the -- of the tower, he saw it. And so he played th-the hymn to warn the city to close the gates and -- and protect itself. And -- which we did. And then -- their -- their attack was repursed -- repursed, and then they had to go back, and we chased them away.</p><p>And -- and they remembered this story being told over generations, because you</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="81"></span> Interview with Witold Pawlikowski "8 January 21, 2015</p><p> know, from -- that if they hear that flo -- that -- that -- that hymn again, they will become free.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So the local people came to a Polish army unit --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: To ask that they play this -- this --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Trumpet.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- that they can be free -- free. Well, of course it took another 50 years, but they -- they're free now.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So these -- these stories do happen and -- and J - I had it in a book and I don't know what happened with the book, but -- but it was written, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you heard it -- and you heard it then, when you --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: After we left.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: After you left.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because it -- you know, it would be written and all that kind of stuff. But can you imagine now, from 1200 something, to have it believe that something like that, if-- if this -- this trumpet is played again in our town --</p></p></dialogue>

You had been deported on April 13", 1940, and two years later you're on this boat, leaving the Soviet Union.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right. Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, were you had been deported to, you know, that second place, were there others that couldn't -- that weren't free? I mean, was it only Polish deportees who were -- or deportees from Poland who were in this cattle breeding, or cattle herding town, or were there deportees from other countries that were also there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, just -- just -- just Poland.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, all the Poles more or less left that place.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Ay -- ma -- those that had the guts enough to say, we are going. But there were some that had little, you know, a little -- started little gardens and th-they put the vegetables on there, something like that. And some decided to stay. And out of over a million and a half of people that were -- that were deported to the Soviet Union during the -- at the time, only couple hundred thousand people have moved away.</p><p>The rest of them either died, or had to wait until 1953 to return to Poland.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay, I wanted -- thank you for filling that in, cause I wanted to get a sense of the scope, and that's what you gave me right now, is that a million and a half people had been deported from these eastern territories of Poland.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And only a couple of hundred thousand were able to leave.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I--I-I think so. And this -- and -- and I think, luckily for us, because we were considered to be military family, just the same like -- like this friend of mine, Janusz, we were able to leave.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: All -- all -- all the young men that -- that were in the -- in the military age, they were taken into the army, or the -- they volunteered for the army.

And so wi-- whoe -- whatever unit came in from -- from the Soviet Union, they were just processed and moved to where the training actually had to start, because they had to retrain.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- their ka -- they kept coming, and so my mother would -- would receive those then, and put them in the different places where they had -- they -- not all of them could live in those buildings, and so there were also tents, that the British had given us. And so there were -- there -- there was a kitchen and, you know, the -- everybody was being fed from the -- the kitchen, and there were the facilities. American gifts were coming, because at the time a lot of people were donating things. So our clothing was -- was American clothing, because that's what we have gotten from -- from them. And as I mentioned to -- then we started school. And there were -- there were no books, so every had -- everything had to be written.

And, so actually, normal life.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I mean, from your description of it, my impression is that it sounds to me, if you take away all of the uncertainty of life, and knowing that this is transitory, and that it will end -- it also sounds like a wonderful place to not be alone, that there will be people there, that you -- you can talk to them, that you could meet other kids, that you could make friends, that -- you know --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yes, you know, yes. And -- and on -- in so -- but we had, you know, we -- of course we're free to go, so we could go to town. And since my mother started working we had some, you know, some of money, and we were able to go to town.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>And the -- the Persians, who are very friendly -- nothing like happens right now -- and so we -- we really started living a normal life. We went to movies, American movies that were being played at -- at that time. And it lasted until about 1943, something like that, and then they started liquidating the camps because all the people were moved away to different -- different locations. And my mother then received a--a proposal to go into town and work for the Polish unit that was taking care of the -- of the refugees and things. And so we moved into the city of Teheran.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="94"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Witold Pawlikowski deg8 January 21, 2015 We rented actually, an apartment -- a -- a room in the -- in a-- in Teheran itself, and my mother was working and I started to go -- and I was going to school, and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Still a Polish school.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: --to a Polish school. And we lived not too far away from another friend of ours that is right now in San Francisco, and we had great time, because -- because we were -- the -- the camp in which actually the sc -- because the -- they kept liquidating the schools, and finally ne -- and -- and that was camp number three. And that was located in the mountains, very beautiful area. And we'd have a bus that would take us there, and in the evening we would be driven back again. And so I went through -- through the grade school, and in -- in 1945, when we moved to i-- to Lebanon, I was already in first grade of high school.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And I also remember that we were returning one time, and I don't know what -- how -- how was it, but we decided to walk. It wasn't that far away, so we were walking on -- on the road towards Teheran, and here comes the Shah. So we waved, you know, and all that stuff, and he --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Was he in a motorcade?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, in--in a limousine, you know, motorcades and all that kind stuff.

A-And our -- our -- our wrong [indecipherable] was over. And so -- so -- you know, then, towards the end of -- almost at the end of the war, in July of 1945, because everything was being liquidated and, you know, the British and the Americans were going to move out of there too, we were taken by train to Baghdad in Iraq. And there we had to stay for  <span class="page-break" number="96"></span> </p><p> 100 Interview with Witold Pawlikowski January 21, 2015 two weeks because something happened with our visa, transitory visa through -- through one of the countries.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And then after that, Lebanon?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And then from -- from Baghdad we went to Lebanon, and we went in -- in buses, all the way to -- to Beirut.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How long did that take?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: A couple days. It was -- it was quite the trip.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Do you remember what you saw through the buses, and what kind of landscape --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Sand and sand and sand. It was a real desert. Until we came to -- to -- to -- to Lebanon. And Lebanon is -- is beautiful. It's green, you know, the -- the mountains are -- are beautiful, and so it was completely different land -- you know, landscape once we entered the territory of Lebanon. So from -- from bay -- from Baghdad I remember that we had an opportunity to visit the -- you know, the -- the marketplaces, the -- the -- you know, and it was -- it was really quite an experience, and I --I don't know where I have it, but I bought myself a -- a -- a -- one of these knifes, you know, that you --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, the long knives?</p></p></dialogue>

So --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Was this a -- all of these journeys, from Teheran to Baghdad to now Beirut, this was all under the aegis of Polish authorities, and they in turn were under the aegis of the British authorities?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, this was already beginning of the international ref-refugee organization.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because that was the end of the war, and all of a sudden they had refugees all over Europe, so they formed this international refugee organization, and they took over the administration.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: So, once we moved to -- to Beirut, and we stayed couple -- couple weeks in -- in a transitory camp in Beirut itself, and then we were moved to a small town called Ghazir(ph), just north of -- of Beirut, in the mountains. And at that time we were given some substis -- subsistence money so we could go on our own.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And -- and in Lebanon, the -- one of the -- as I understand, one of the agreements with the Lebanese government was that the people that are coming in are not going to become part of the economy of the -- of Lebanon. But they are -- they are going to be self-sufficient. So -- so that's we -- that's why we are needing the subsistence, so we can live on our own.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And how long did you stay there?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you also have much contact with local people? Lebanese?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yeah, yes, you know, I -- in a way that th-they were friendly people, and th- they were -- they were really amazingly capable of learning languages, because you know, they had a long history of being traders. And so this -- so this became a natural with them. So most of the people that had any -- any shops in like -- in Ghazir, they s -- they spoke adequate Polish to tell you that, for example, they would c-call, pig missus, pig missus. It wasn't that the missus was a pig, but they killed the pig, and they were selling the meat. So -- so -- but -- but they were very, very nice, very polite, and a friend of mine who lives in Australia was telling me years later that she moved to Australia and -- and she met a-- an Arab from -- from Ghazir. And so she -- the -- he emigrated after her, and they got married in -- in Australia.

So they are -- they're really fantastic people.</p><p>And -- you know, and we never, never had anything that we would be afraid of. We lived among them, being scout, we -- we went on -- on the trips, you know, just walking trips around Lebanon, and we never had any problem at all.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you ever pick up the local language?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Some. Yo-You know enough to kind of get -- get along it, and -- but of course, over the years of not using it, it -- it -- it just disappears. I just remember Leban -- Lebanese national anthem.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You remember -- so if you were to walk around, you'd be able to sing it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: But -- but you know, it -- they were really very friendly people and they were -- after the first World War they were under what they called French protectorate. So all -- almost everyone spoke French. There was also American university in-- in --in pa -- in --in--- in Beirut, and some of our older members of the school went to study in there, and -- but then, you know, towards the -- the 1950 --  <span class="page-break" number="103"></span> 107 Interview with Witold Pawlikowski January 21, 2015</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: What did your mother do for the five years?

So she was busy all the time. You know, she -- she had things to do.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you ever see her, in all of those years, those 10 years, did you ever see her despair?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. I think after you go through something like that, you could have done all the desperation in two years. The rest of it was a wonderful life, basically. You know, of course you didn't know anything about your husband, you were lonely, no family, and -- but there are people like you that became, you know, part of your circle. And so she never despaired, and -- and I think she -- she was -- she was too busy to -- to think. And then besides, she could -- she could, you know, embroider, so she would embroider. She wrote poems, which -- which I have, you know. And so she was quite a positive type of person. So -- so anyway, so after -- after all this was done and -- and told her that -- that they were trying to relocate the people as soon as possible so they can start normal life, because this was not a normal life.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, no, this was all done between the Polish government and the British. They -- they realized that they have to remove those people from Lebanon because they had -- they had an agreement that they won't work. So what do you --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Well that can't happen forever.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, that can't happen forever. So they decided that the best way is to simply bring them to -- to real life. Really real life, not what we have for life for the last number of years. So, we were load -- loaded on the shi -- on the military ship. And you know, on a transport ship in Beirut, and moved across the Mediterranean Sea and up north to -- to Great Britain, and we were unloaded with -- in the -- the port of Hull, h-u-I-1, and then transported to a military camp, a post-military camp in northern England, on the border with Scotland.</p></p></dialogue>

Not with a British accent, of course, but -- but nevertheless, enough to be able to move about England with no problem. And so, when I moved to London, I was with Rilka(ph) for a little while, and then she arranged for me to go to a youth hostel, and I was working in a youth hostel. So I started looking for job and -- and the -- the guy said, well, there's something that you can -- you can do, there is some factory that you can go in. So I went for an interview and the gentleman that was interviewing me, he said, what do you want to do in life? And I said, what -- I would like to be an engineer. And he says, oh, I'm sorry, I'm looking for a worker, not for an engineer. So --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So it sounds like it was a trick question.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I suppose. But -- so I was -- I was -- I had to go back, and they said, you know, there is -- there is a -- an office of a -- of a--a Polish American, who was born in -- in United States, but was educated in Poland. He became an engineer, and he worked in the Polish corps of engineer in -- when -- during the campaign in -- in Italy, and there he met a British engineer who was working for the British corps of engineers, and they formed fre -- friendship, and they decided that they liked each other so much that ti-- after -- after the war, they opened an office.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, how wonderful.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And it was really fantastic, because, you know -- but my mother told me in the beginning of my career that, just remember to -- when you work for someone, take a letter of recommendation from the person.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And -- and three of those siblings, all boys, escaped to the United States in -- before the beginning of the second war -- or the first World War. Because, when you are drafted into the Russian army, your career lasted 25 years, so all your life, basically. And so they didn't want to -- to do that, and these -- they -- they came to the United States, and one of them settled in Baltimore, and the other one settled in -- in Ohio, and the third one somewhere in Ohio also. And when we -- when we left Russia, my mother somehow reestablished contact with him, and -- Uncle Miczestaw(ph) and he asked her, couple years later, if we would be wanting maybe to emigrate to the United States, and my mother said yes.

He runs to the colonel, tells him the story, and the colonel does whatever necessary, and within two weeks, I was shipped to Frankfurt, Germany, where the American consulate was, with two sergeants that swore that they knew me since.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And they had never seen you before, huh?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No. And I was given the U.S. citizenship.

And -- and it really helped me quite a bit because sometime later the same sergeant comes in and he says, do you speak a little Russian? And I said yes, I do. And he says, oh, would you like to go to a refresher course in Russia? And I say yes, of course. So I was shipped, for three weeks of Russian refresher course, in Oberammergau, Germany, and you probably know Oberammergau is a place where every 10 years they give the -- the Easter thing.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Your first grade.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My first grade started clicking back. And by the time we were e -- we were finished, I was way ahead of them, because my pronunciation was [indecipherable] better than th-theirs. And -- and you know, I had the opportunity to -- to visit that  <span class="page-break" number="119"></span> Interview with Witold Pawlikowski ms January 21, 2015</p><p> wonderful place, and I -- since they were doing all these kind of things that my mother always told -- told me that, you have to have, in your house, you have to have a picture of Our Lady feeding the baby Jesus.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And so I had that remembrance, so I went to one of the sculptors, and I said, did you ever make the sculpture of Our Lady feeding the baby Jesus? And he says, no, but that's interesting. He says, come, come, come, come. So he took me to his -- to his workplace, and he starts pulling out the books, trying to figure out, you know.</p><p>And he finds a -- a picture of lady -- Our Lady feeding the baby Jesus. And he says, you know, Pll -- P1l-- ll put you on rock -- 0-on the rock and -- and [indecipherable] this, and she's going to be feeding baby Jesus. Is that -- is that what you want?

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: From Oberammergau. Well, thank you for sharing that. That -- did you explain to the people where you were taking the Russian refresher course that -- how you came to know Russian to begin with?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. But, you know, that -- basically, you know, I -- I found out that most Americans are not interested in that, because it's -- it's so far away from their background, from their pe -- that you s-simply do not understand, that how in the heck -- excuse me -- my English -- you can come to somebody's home at two o'clock in the morning and take him away, and leave everything -- you know, you leave everything behind. It was just in-- incomprehensible. And so there -- they were not interested. And so therefore, you know, I just kept it to myself, and I don't have anything against it, because it is so different. You know, how do you explain to -- to people that never experienced any kind of a -- of [indecipherable] with authorities, that somebody can come to your house at two o'clock in the morning and take you  <span class="page-break" number="121"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Witold Pawlikowski " January 21, 2015 away, leave all your things behind, and, you know. But -- but I explained to -- to this -- to these guys, and they accepted what it was.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was there a reason why they would have wanted you to take this Russian refresher course? Did they have anything in mind for you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, because I was wer -- working for the regiment.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And the regiment was on the border, so they needed people that were familiar with the language, just in case --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I see.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: --if some -- something should happen, each unit had a translator that could interrogate the people. And here's a guy that not only that experienced being there --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- and knowing the people. And so I was very grateful. But then I suffered some -- somehow, later on, because whenever we would go to Canada, and I take my citizenship papers with me, I was always stopped on the border, and I -- and there was also a telephone call made to Washington, because my -- my paper, my -- my citizenship paper is not the normal thing. It does not have my photograph, it does not have sig -- signature of -- of -- of a judge. It has a signature of Consul General of the United States and Frankfurt, Germany, and it just doesn't sound normal. So --  <span class="page-break" number="122"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Witold Pawlikowski me January 21, 2015</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay. It wasn't what they were used to seeing.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So it was -- it was always checked, and finally I decided, what am I doing, why don't I just get a passport and be done with it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you did.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And I did and ever since then I was -- it was okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So, you know, a-all these experiences add up to -- to a -- I would say a rather interesting life, if you want to call it that way. And then, when I was drafted into the army, I decided to move my mother to Chicago, because here we -- we have many more friends and people that we -- acquaintances that we had from the past. And so I moved her, and then I went back and was drafted. And when I was released I came back, and I restarted my studies at Illinois Institute of Technology, and I started working as a draftsman for engineering firms. And my first firm of employment was a fi -- was a firm of -- in-- in which our chief engineer was Lithuanian. And most of the draftsmen were lith -- were Lithuanians. So, that was my -- my beginning of a career in Chicago.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, did they ever -- did they ever discuss the [indecipherable] with you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The treaty of [indecipherable]  <span class="page-break" number="123"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> 127 Interview with Witold Pawlikowski January 21, 2015</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, no, and interesting thing is that -- that once the Polish army had left Soviet Union, the Soviet Union formed another army, which was the -- an -- a new government --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- of Lublin, and a new army. And that army fought with the Soviet Union, and a-- you know, participated in the liberation of Poland. And of course, the Anders" Army was a traitor. So -- but it was -- it was, you know, an interesting experience, because I already had something to show. That not only that I did get the document from -- from the army that I worked as a draftsman, so -- and when I -- when I came to the -- to -- to Chicago, I started working for several firms, and the wa -- and again for U.S. Steel Corporation, because th -- I was already with experience from -- from --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: From Baltimore.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- from Baltimore, from Bethlehem Steel. And I worked in different engineering firms until 1978. And in "78, I-- I read an advertisement in a civil engineering magazine, a re -- and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission had been looking for personnel. And so I went for an interview, and because my background was civil engineering, and it was also in -- in -- in dams, because the last firm that I was working for was a firm of Dr. Bauer(ph), who had, you know, his doctorate in  <span class="page-break" number="124"></span>  128 Interview with Witold Pawlikowski January 21, 2015 hydraulics, and so I worked on -- on things. And so I was accepted. And so in 1978 until 2008, for 30 years, I worked for U.S. un-unit. And that was really fantastic experience, too, because we -- there were five offices like that, and Chicago office had the Middle East -- the mi-- mi -- middle west.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Midwest, mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And so we had, you know, a number of dams. And so, all these thir -- 30 years that I worked, I haven't visited all the -- all the dams.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh wow.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: So there's -- there's quite a number, and people always say what? Tell me? You know, but there are hundreds of dams that are run not only by the Corps of Engineers, but also by private industry, where they have, you know, hydraulic facilities. And because they -- they are using the waters of the United States, they are obligated to take a license and to fulfill the requirements, and we would go and visit and see if everything is okay, and if not, we would write down what we find that is -- needs to be repaired, and they were obligated to do that. So, it was -- it was</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Sounds like an interesting -- interesting job.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh -- oh, it was -- it was very interesting, and you never get tired, because you know, a dam is a dam and a -- a -- and a plant is a plant. No, it's not. Each one is  <span class="page-break" number="125"></span> </p><p> 129 Interview with Witold Pawlikowski January 21, 2015 different, each one has separate problems, or arrangements or whatever.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you think much about those two years of deportation throughout your life, or do you kind of push it to the past?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I try to push it to the past, because I don't think that -- well, it's not my nature, you know. And -- and besides, I've read so many times when people are reliving their -- their past, and especially if the past is not a pleasant one, you are unhappy.</p><p>You are -- you are always under this -- this influence of this -- these horrible years, when you starved to death, when you were beating 200, you know, lice a day. When your mother almost died, you know, and where you were just by a-- by a miracle, taken away from there. Because you know, I do not consider it any different but just miracle, that we just happened to be in the right place, at the right time, so that we could leave that, you know, wonderful life of the Soviet Union, you know. And so I --Idon't want to think about it. I know I had that experience, but --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did you ever wonder why you -- why you were able to leave, and others didn't, couldn't?</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="126"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Witold Pawlikowski " January 21, 2015</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Lasked, but I didn't get a answer, you know, and -- and -- but I pray daily, thank Him for that -- for that opportunity to be able to leave.

So -- and it took the re-remaining of those people that were deported, those that survived, they didn't have an opportunity to return po -- to Poland until 1953. And we left 1942. So that's 11 more years of that kind of living, whereas I was saved that/</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And just to -- so that people will understand, can you explain why they would have been able to leave in 1953? What event allowed that to happen?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Uncle Stalin died. And so --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And that meant?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- the changes begin -- began to -- to occur in the Soviet Union.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And at that time apparently, the Polish government in Poland --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: The communist government.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- would have been able to -- to obtain release for those people.

So --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You mean on the attack on Germany.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: When they attacked the Germany, and then -- and then they occupied the Polish territory, all the people from the underground forces, all the politicians, whoever they could put their hands on, were deported again, so that that was in 19 -- you know, 43, deg44, "45, and later. And only after the -- the final -- you know, when -- when -- when Stalin died, and changes started to occur, they could manage to release those people.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, I suppose just a human part of it, and a -- and -- and a -- and a positive human heart -- part of it, that please don't dwell on it. That it happened, and it's gone, you live different life, and appreciate what you have, cause you never know what life brings you. And I don't -- I don't think I would like to load her and burden her with such things as -- as killing 200 lice in -- in a day. You know, it's -- it's just inconceivable.

How does -- you know, there's -- there's something through your life experience that can tell her something about you, and what would you want her to know?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: About the world.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: That there is a greater world that one should visit. About the people, that you should not be locked up, that you should be open for other people. And that -- and if you are open for other people, even if the -- if there are people that are against you, you can brush them aside because there are other people that will be friendly towards you. I think that's important to know, because I experienced it, you know, the -- the -- the Cossacks, the Uzbeks, the Iranians, the Lebanese, the British, you know. The-These -- these are experiences, because all th-thi -- all this expands your brain, and makes -- makes the world smaller, and larger at the same time, and makes you appreciate different cultures without having to remember the bad things. And I think that's very important that -- that you should not carry something that happened 200 or 500 years ago, and you still -- you -- you still kind of have some hatred tow- towards the new generation that doesn't know anything about it. And I -- I think it's important, because if you don't practice that, we'll always be at war.

No, it -- you know, of course you remember.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You remember the -- the -- that you were just kicked out of your own country.</p><p>But I don't want to dw-dwell on it. I-- 1--- I want it to be as an experience, but not something that I experience every day. I think that's very negative, and -- and -- and I think it's -- that poisons your -- your whole life, you know, your whole outlook at life, you know. And you know, i-it's -- it's -- it's not constructive, because you can live with -- with the [indecipherable] you can live with -- you know, I mean, like I told you about this story about these guys that were -- for hundreds of years they are looking for someone that's -- that's going to play the anthem for them, to -- to liberate them, you know. This is the positive experience, and I think these are more important than the other ones, if you have survived them, of course.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But -- but I think -- you know, I don't -- I don't hold it anything against, say, the Russians. Because they suffered more than I. I suffered for two years, they suffered  <span class="page-break" number="135"></span>  139 Interview with Witold Pawlikowski January 21, 2015 for the -- all their lives. And -- and you know, this -- this -- even during the tsars, there was different kind of situation, but th-they were people th-ther -- that were downtrodden, and then they liberated themselves in the name of the communism -- and they were downtrodden again.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And so, you know, and you -- but you also have to remember -- remember I told you about the story about the German officer, that you -- sometimes you really wonder, how can it be that people can be so cruel? A-And this -- can I repeat this story?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes, of course you can.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And -- and -- and the story is, I was reading -- I read in a newspape -- in-- in a--in a ga -- in a book that -- as -- as -- as you know, there were concentration camps that were started on the Polish territory by the Germans. And most of them were to liquidate people that were undesirables, which was Poles, and the Jews, and there was -- there was a story about this transport that was being taken in one of the camps, and the people were led into the camp, and there was a -- a Jewish mother, and four or five year old little boy. And they were walking in and -- and at the gate stands the -- the Gestapo officer, dressed up in beautiful uniform, with the ha -- with the hat and -- and the long boots, and -- and -- and the [indecipherable] you know,  <span class="page-break" number="136"></span> </p><p> 140 Interview with Witold Pawlikowski January 21, 2015 that he was kind of hitting his -- his leg with it. And he was -- for the boy it was -- it was a marvelous, wonderful figure. So the boy just pulls away from his -- from his mother's hand and runs to the officer and offers him the only thing that he has in life, an apple. And the officer smiles at the child, takes the apple, bends over, grabs him by the hands and -- and kills him on the spot. How do you explain that? How do you explain the fact that pole -- no, hun -- thousands of Polish officers were murdered by NKVD, by killing them with a bullet in his -- in the back of their head?</p><p>You know, it was just a very simple thing, right. Next, next. Then you go home, you have supper. You put your child on -- on your lap, tell him the story. And next day you go and do the same thing. Impossible to believe that human beings are capable of that. Am I to -- to -- to remember all these things all the time, and accuse all the people of the -- being possible to do that? No, it -- it was circumstances. But circumstances like that, there are hundreds of them, you know, that people can be capable of such barbarity, and it -- in a civilized nation. You know, to -- to kill six million Jews? To have special concentration camps that you just do nothing but daily, you know, take them to the bathroom --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Death rooms.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- to -- to the -- to ta -- basically take the shower, and instead of water coming out, a gas comes out of the shower things, and you -- and you kill them by the hundred.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="137"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Witold Pawlikowski mt January 21, 2015 You know, and all in the name of an idea that -- that these are bad people, and that you have to get rid of them because -- because you are looking for lebensraum, which is the space, you know, living space, the Germans were doing it. They were going to liquidate the Poles, and they were going to liquidate the Russians, because they were going to take over all this territory and form a thousand year old Reich, you know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The idea.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: That was the idea. And -- and many of them went for it. And then when I was in Germany in -- in -- in 1955 or "56, it was all gone. They were all back to normal people, you know, and you -- nobod -- nobody knew. They just didn't know that something like that was happening. Which is, of course, something else. But -- but --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Well, from what you say, it sounds like we're veering between the need to go forward, and the need to remember, but not to dwell on what you remember. Is that right?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, you -- you -- you have to remember. And that's why I think the Holocaust Museum d-does a wonderful thing, and I'm so grateful that they extended their willingness to come to places like -- like my home. Yes, you must, but not that you have to, you must remember that. And you must teach that to the next generation, so they don't repeat that kind of mistake. And I think, if we learned any lessons, then  <span class="page-break" number="138"></span> </p><p> 142 Interview with Witold Pawlikowski January 21, 2015 maybe the sacrifices will bear fruit. But the -- the only thing we have to do is to make sure that somehow we convey it to other generations, you know, and they remember that human beings are capable of these unbelievable atrocities, all in the name of some idiotic idea, or -- or in the name of Bachkastani(ph), who -- who killed his own -- he had the problems in the beginning of -- of the -- of the war when he waged war against Germany, because before, in the 30s, he killed all the officers" staff.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You're talking about Stalin, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, you know. And so -- so, you know, because you don't trust anyone, even the people that were with you all this time, helping you to get to the top of the pile, and then you kill them because you mistrust them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And -- and I think this is the si-- this is the something that -- that will -- we should be able to convey to other generations, that you know, please don't become one of those.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And this concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Mr. Witold Pawlikowski on January 19 -- excuse me, January 21", 2015.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>Okay, so Mr. Pawlikowski, now I want to talk to you a little bit about the documents here that you have on your lap. Have you ever seen anything like this before?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I haven't. Because I d-- apparently these were filled out by my mother somewhere. I don't rem -- I don't see the date. But it says that it's a displaced person registration record, which -- which shows the registration number, and my mother's name, place of birth, religion, the father's name, mother's name and last place of residency in Poland. And okay, thank you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And there's one for her and I believe one for you as well.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: There's one for me, which is -- which is I'm really grateful for that, but this a -- cause I didn't even know that -- that something like that exists.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="140"></span>  144 Interview with Witold Pawlikowski January 21, 2015</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: The third page is part of the listing in the list on the [indecipherable] boat that you took to the United States. Your names are down there.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right, my names are -- are here, and my mother's birthdate and place of birth, and -- international ref -- refugee organization travel documents are issued in Beirut.</p><p>So this is the -- the register of the -- on the ship that -- that -- which we took to -- to the United States, which is really something. You know, they just simply didn't share these documents with us, you know. Maybe they would have if we asked for it, but -- and -- and these are also some registration cards.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: For you and for her?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Date was 4-9-1950. So this was when we apparently are leaving Lebanon to go to England. Yes, last occasion Beirut, Lebanon, and destination England, on SS Oxfordshire.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You know, it's interesting that I fou -- I got those documents after I got the questionnaire that you filled out. And as I was looking through them I said, this confirms everything that you told me in the questionnaire, everything that you wrote in the que -- now, one wouldn't doubt it, it's simply --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: You do have documentation of it.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: We do have documentation.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Right.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="141"></span> </p><p> 145 Interview with Witold Pawlikowski January 21, 2015</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah. So what does it say? Does it -- does it have a meaning for you when you see something like this, 60 -- 70 years after the event?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, it's just like what you said. It -- it really shows the documentation that I did go through those things. It's not only the Stalin's picture that I have to show you, but -- but there is actually documentation. Of course, we don't have any documentation from the Soviet Union, but -- but this is -- is a-- a wonderful thing, and this -- this is application for assistance, whatever that was. And it was 1947, so we were in Lebanon at that time. And this must be the -- when international refu -- refugee organization had taken over, and my mother had to fill this out. So -- and this also is a recommendation from England, from the Polish hostel in Lothian(ph) Park, Pendred(ph) Cumberland, that my mother has left the camp to go to a hostel in Liverpool, and was due to sail for USA on the following day. So this is confirmation that we did travel on Her Majesty's -- because Her Majesty paid for the trip.</p></p></dialogue>

I mean, something that says that she left in feb -- second February for the Danfield Lane Hostel in Liverpool, and then -- you know, and -- and this is the international refugee organization which -- I-- I --I have to read it, but --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Of course.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- but it's a statement of my mother, that she had to sign, that she waives and surrenders any rights and claims of demands of any blah-blah-blah, whatever.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Some official language there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Some official language that I would be glad to -- to read, but you know, we are really grateful to -- to -- to the fact that such an organization was formed, and helped not thousands, but millions of people to go back and to start life again, in a normal life. Not the place where you see somebody hitting a child's head on the -- on the pavement, but normal life, and you can appreciate that and -- and you know, that's why I want -- when I came to the United States, I tried to every -- you know, to -- to do everything I can not to go against the law. I was never arrested. I did not use drugs, because life was too dear to me. And I -- I think that's important to know,  <span class="page-break" number="143"></span>  147 Interview with Witold Pawlikowski January 21, 2015 that you just live once, and you live for a very short period of time, and it is much simpler to live a simple life, a normal life, where you have family, where you have -- you go to church, where you worship, where you remember that it -- it was not your doing that you were saved, it was something else. And then I think it's -- that's very important how, even though you have no proof, cause you -- cause you been just, you know, right place in the right time, but something else.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I understand.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And I - and I think it's im-important to -- to know and to acknowledge it, and to thank God for -- for this gift of life.
