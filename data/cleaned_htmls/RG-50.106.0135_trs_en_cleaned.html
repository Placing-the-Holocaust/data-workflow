<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Mm-hm. What was the town that you --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Siauliai. Siauliai. Shauloh. It's about 30,000 people. Was a big [indecipherable] hub. And I went to grade school, I went to high school pri -- was private Jewish high school and was separated.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now what di -- grade school you went to a Jewish school also?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, it was, it really was -- I think it was -- must have supported by the state or the county, but it was sets -- separated. Lithuanian people went to their schools, we went to our schools. And like on the holidays we would go to a tailor and have clothes made, you know, they would  <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> </p><p> measure us and we'd have to pick out the fabric, all stuff. And summertime -- we always had a maid in our house. My mother -- my grandmother lived with us. In summertime we'd go to the lake, the cottage. Played basketball, had a bicycle. Til 1933, things start getting a little bit hairy.</p><p>Hitler came in power.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, you were about eight.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I-I was about eight, it was about 1925.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now before -- before 1933, you were going to the Jewish school.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: 1 -- I went to school all the way to 1941.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay, but -- but when you were younger, when you were --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I went to kindergarten --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- eight.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- at five, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, and so all the children in your school were Jewish?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And were all of your playmates Jewish and so --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Right. We -- I didn't have really any Gentile friends. Maybe a little bit. Really most of them were Jewish.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Now -- imagine all of them were Jewish. And why my parents didn't leave, I don't know. I know they were talking. My dad said he [indecipherable] to go to Australia. But what happened 1933 they -- the oceans were mined, so --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: The what?</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: The oceans were mined, you know, were mined. I mean, it was dangerous for boats to go because they would go in -- into a mine. And another thing happened that Lithuania restricted taking out money out of the country. So some people did, they would give the [indecipherable] money to deposit upon -- to deposit in a Swiss bank. And it was whether he did it or not. In fact one person in our town borrowed money and he disappeared. And everyone said gee, this guy is not really honest. But his wife stayed behind and then she sold the property and she paid back his debt. So that was a story. Now in 1933 we had another problems. Lithuania is very pro -- very anti-Semitic. Very much anti-Semitic. Like, we had a big steeple in our town, Easter we would stay inside because the priest would tell them the Jews killed Jesus. You know that story still [indecipherable]. We had -- soccer team was called Maccabee. And any time Maccabee would win, we would leave the soccer field much sooner because it would be big fights. But it was very much anti-Semitic and some signs were in Jewish and they start -- Lithuanians start breaking them. For instance my dad was going to a customer of his to collect money, but somebody [indecipherable] his front wheel and his shoulder got dislocated. He never fixed it up. But that happened. Then, in 19 --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So these were Lithuanian --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Lithuanians, right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- people who were doing these things?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right. Actually it was -- the Lithuanians were Catholics and Jewish people, we had a few Russians -- Russian Orthodox, but that's how it was. Our town was about 30,000 people, probably 8,000 Jewish people. We had eight synagogues. Frankel was a person who had a big leather factory with about 2,000 people. He would process leather. Was a really big factory. Our</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> </p><p> -- in the house we owned, Singer Sewing Machine, they were our tenants, and they were the headquarters for the three Baltic states, Lithuania and Latvia and Estonia. We lived well. We had in our house running water, plumbing. And that wa -- meant a lot because the wa -- the winters that time very severe like northern Canada. In fact the doctor said the rich people are smart because they didn't get -- they get less colds because the other people have to go, during the night go to the outhouse and that's the source of -- and my dad did a lot of building, he -- even til 1938, as a matter of fact, after Lithuania became independent, I [indecipherable] permits for po - - they had archives. All the building he had, he had -- we had a big house like [indecipherable] big house, two story house. We had -- he built -- we had -- one of the tenants was a printing office with what, maybe 20 or 30 people. And the other one that makes sweaters. He had storage tanks in different places on the railroad. St -- warehouses which he built. We weren't -- not in American standards, but under European standards we were considered well-to-do.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And in your home, what was the religious atmosphere?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Jewish, very much. My dad [indecipherable] being a rabbi here, you know, but that was a way of life. It was a way of life. We observed all the holidays, we kept kosher. We mo -- we wouldn't cook on Saturday, we would go to synagogue. As [indecipherable] older, on Saturday we would sneak away, we'd got to court and I li-listened to civil cases. And my dad looked the other way around, he wasn't so fanatic. But he would drop himself off. He'd pray every morning and Friday night we would go synagogue and Saturday we'd go. And Friday was sort of interesting, you know, in the wintertime the days are short and my mother had -- we had a maid, but she had to knock herself out to prepare everything for Sabbath. And everything was done by hand, she would bake bread and fish. Friday night was the biggest, you know, very large meal. So that was</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> </p><p> -- was -- you know, I -- what happened to us, at home we speak Yiddish. In high school it was the Zionist movement, we speak -- we had to speak Hebrew, because the teacher from that in Lithuania was actually our language which we had to learn. So that was the language problems -- not problems, but that was the situation.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, you had siblings?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, [had older sister.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Older sister, and what was her name?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Esther.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And how much older was she?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Six years.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Six.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And [had a older brother, four years, Abraham.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And we all survived. We all survived the concentration camp. My parents did not make it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: So really, that's the story. But it was -- it was -- what happened farther down the line, the Russians came in in 1940, in Lithuania. And we f --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Now that was the first occupation?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Correct.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: The Russians --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: The Russians.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- in 1940.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And what happened is really, people, Jewish people in Lithuania were very, very anti- Semitic. You couldn't go in medical school, it was [indecipherable]. So people would go to Switzerland and come back and laws were very much restricted. I-I'm not sure accountants or engineers, but I don" think --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Now, in 1940 you were 15 years old.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Iwas 15, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And you were in high school --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I was high school.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- Jewish high school.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Jewish high school. Actually they -- the Jewish high school was -- the Russians had a different program. I -- I would have been graduated about 17, but something happened, my dad finally [indecipherable] with high school and he took me out and then, you know, had private tutors [indecipherable] other thing. All my classmates was accelerated program, they got to graduate at 16, but I didn't make the cut because I was just -- I was taken out [indecipherable] came back. But what happened then, being so anti-Semitic when they're -- the Russians were very poor and they tried to impose quotas in the farmlands, they had to give so much bacon and bread. And o-of course farmer will rebel. And I don't think Lithuanian people are too educated, it's -- a big, large amount is really illiterate. And rumors were that the Jewish people are imposing on the farming, because the Russians would make raids and make sure that farmers meet their quota. So that went over like wildfire. And in deg41 --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Now, how did it affect your life --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It's affect my --  <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- in 1940?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- it affect my life because our -- our -- our school wa -- my schooling system was interrupted.</p><p>We had to comply with the Russian schooling system. Instead of going, I don't know was [indecipherable] eight years, they -- I think they -- the Russians meaning, they had a 10 years program. It affected that they made us go to school in the holidays. S -- as a matter of fact, I think I was a fairly good student, out of a class of 40, I was number seven or six. And I remember one time in history, I knew the -- the subjects called, but the teacher called me to the board to make presentation and I re -- you know, I refused it. Another week I applied and got an A. So they made us go to school on Saturday. We stayed there but we are not participate, we are sitting there. That's how it affect us.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Now, did you go to school a-at your same Jewish school, or did you --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: It was the same Jewish school, but different program.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Different program.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: A different program. Also --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So it was the same students --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah, the sa --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- the same --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- the same class.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- the same teachers.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Same -- well, the sam -- they took in some other stu -- teachers who maybe -- you know, the</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> </p><p> high school I went, it was a very good high school, and I think most of the teachers were PhD., well qualified. When the Russians came in they sort of watered it down. Teachers came in who was less -- less qualified. We also had to study Russia -- Russian, and Yiddish before we spoke Hebrew, because what I was [indecipherable] was that Jewish or Yiddish is a jargon, it's part of German, which is not true, but I mean in the -- and you have to learn Hebrew, which -- and that was the modern Hebrew, not the religious Hebrew like [indecipherable]. So it affected me that respect. On this other hand I start learning the Jewish literature which t -- and they had poets and writing it. I had to study Russia -- Russian, and how else did it affect me? Well, oh they confiscate our property, they confiscate our property, everything, the Russians. I don't know how my dad survived, I remember leaving the house, but he was very energetic person and I'm sure it start hitting him hard. Prior to that, actually, when the Russians came in there was a big sack of money. And we were afr -- I don't know how he made it and when he made it. And we burned it because it's a raid, they feel we might be bourgeois, which is the upper class. And tears were in his eyes, I was a child, I didn't realize it. But that's how it affected me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So he burned the money?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We burned the money, it was a lot of them, a big bag and crisp bills on a -- I -- we all encouraged him to do it because it's a raid, hey, you're part of -- part of the Czar or something like that. So it affected us also, it was confiscated -- I think being -- my dad was very well liked, but I think also confiscated because I had to go into a sort of a [indecipherable] had to strip naked and nurses were sitting there and boy at 15, I was sort of intimidated. And they decided that I should maybe not continue with -- with school, I should go some sort of a trade. And I think was also a -- also was because my dad was well-to-do.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So the Russians decided this?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, I mean the Russians -- the Russians or the government installed a -- they installed like [indecipherable] government, it was a puppet government.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm, mm-hm. And so did you then go to study a trade?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, no, because -- the reason I didn't, because the Germans came in --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Oh, okay.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- i-in -- in deg41, but if I would have been in the Russians, I don't think, who have decided -- probably they would not let me continue with school.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So how -- what happened when the Germans came in?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, before that another thing happened, very interesting. My dad was very well liked, was very well liked, I don't know what happened. He got along with everyone. But the Russians tried to take away the management of the town. And they had freight cars with straw and [indecipherable] them to Siberia. Our family, somehow they didn't do it. And one of the guys, by the name of Walpen was sort of -- he said, remember, he said, the rich people have the luck. And what really happened, after the war, those people, whoever fought in the war would s -- they got an education. You know, they send them Siberia, I am sure they were drafted in service, but they got educated. Several of them showed up in Israel with nice degrees. So I think even they were sent in Siberia they didn't have the harsh treatment that we encountered later on by the Germans.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And wh-why did they send them to Siberia?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because they were [indecipherable] and that was the method in Russia.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So it was a punishment?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Punishment, uprooted -- uproo --</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Degradation.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- uproot them, outroo them. In fact, all system is like that. I tried to analyze why the Russian people are drinking so much, and they do a lot of drinking. And I think what happens there, once you start acquiring some property, that proved you -- you di -- you come in the middle of night, pack in two or three hours.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And after awhile it in -- discouraged them to do anything because they have to leave it behind. Also, I sort of found out at that time -- the Russians, you know, any time, the system they had, the fear. Like we spoke -- a widow of some Russian person told us, she said -- her husband was sent to Siberia. So what happened, she said well, he was [indecipherable] always claimed that Stalin was god -- Stalin was the leader of Russia -- and he said, in Russian he said he had a dream, he said before Stalin h-he [indecipherable] he couldn't get a replacement. And he said in Russian, before Stalin came in, everything fine, but now Russian's -- Stalin's son came in and signed so much that his rear, his ass can see the sun. [indecipherable] just for that he's sent away to Siberia. So then in "41, it was like when the Russians came in their army was so dilapidated, so dilapidated and now he thought I didn't have anything. And [indecipherable] you know, baking bread and send to Russia, but when they were treated in, I think it was June, the middle of June I was on a picnic and all of a sudden we were bombed. It was surprise attack and the Russians were having a party on the border and -- and I think -- Tilsit was a border town, I think we were maybe a hundred kilometers or 60 miles from the border. They start retreating in a hurry. Now our house was a very big house and ver -- very enforced basement, you know, it's reinforced concrete. And we fo -- we thought it's a bomb shelter. So what happened then, my</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> </p><p> dad and his brother decide they're not leaving the town, so they'll stay there, and the corner of our house was bombed, but they survived. My brother, who was older, he wanted to go to Russia. So he and a few refugees from Poland went to the Russian border and they came back, said the border is closed, they wouldn't let anyone in. My mother and my sister, we also walked out of town towards Russia. We didn't have any food. We stopped to some relatives, they abandoned their house. We had some sour, you know, yogurt, we find something to eat. But then we were bombed with machine guns by the Germans because that what's army, I was laying in the trenches. And then after that we felt we didn't have the chance, so we came back to our house. And another thing, sort of people asked me about it and myself --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: No, so that -- you came back to the house.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You were 16.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You were with your mother and your sister?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And the whole family. The whole family.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And your father.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And my brother, all of us.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And your brother.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: All of us.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So everybody was there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="11"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And then -- then Germans came in. The Germans. It was -- Germans came in already in 19 -- in deg41, and it was raids. Before they even -- Germans came in, they took -- they raided people and put them in prison and never came back. They made them deep --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: They put who in prison?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Just raids would come the middle of the night --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- take away the men. And they would move them -- m-make them dig their own graves and shoot them. Thi-Thi -- the --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Any particular men, or just random?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Leadership. The rabbi, lawyers, prominent people. Prominent people. Again [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Now this was just Jews, or --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Just Jews, absolutely --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Just Jews, okay.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- just Jews, just Jews.</p></p></dialogue>

They -- we heard in our -- Lithuania had -- was known for being educated among the Jewish community, we had a lot of seminaries. They -- the seminary students were shot and what I heard, were shot by Lithuanians and the journalists took picture. And their reward was golden teeth, their clothing with [indecipherable]. And really, what happened in Lithuania, a funny thing, my dad told me that.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="12"></span> </p><p> When things were taken away, he say watch. Those people never made anything and they"!l be the same thing. They would drink. Maybe the Jewish people didn't make any more money, but they tried to acquire like candelabras, a suit. They wouldn't drink. Lithuanians did a lot of drinking. He said look, here they have all the property. In a couple of years they won't have anything. And it was true. So that started off, in 1941 they start running out of people. And eventually they got us in ghetto. It was a dilapidated area next to a lake.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now this was in the same town?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: The same town, Shavel, Shavel. They surrounded it with barbed wires. We sort of felt we couldn't escape because I was dark-headed -- dark-haired and blue eye -- dark hair. My -- I had sort of an accent, my R was not sharp enough because I even knew the language, but people speak, they could recognize that I'm not a Lithuanian. Plus, I was circumcised. So we -- the escape thing wa-was not in our favor. The send away my dad, send away my brother to work ina farm, you know, as a farmhand? But they start rounding of people on the farm, but the farmer got word, and those guys were killed right away too. So the farmer got word of that, he put them back together. So we stayed intact and what happened, having a soap factory, my dad felt -- was self-employed. So even -- to make soap you need fat, but we didn't have any fat. So we got under and barter and sell for food, and we'd get --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Now where -- where would you go to barter?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: If we -- in the same town, but we would leave the ghetto and go to our f -- f -- to our soap factory, so we're employed there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see. So in the ghetto, were you free to move in and out of the ghetto?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, wa -- sort of, sort of, I mean they -- people would work. They would take out people and</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="13"></span> </p><p> work. For instance, my mother worked in the hospital, in the German hospital. In the beginning we all stay together and we supposed to work in the soap factory which my dad and if -- initially owned it, but he made it fictitiously gave some Lithuanian who was the owner, so we worked for him.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see, so you were allowed to go out to work in the soap factory?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right, right. And -- but we couldn't do much, you know, get a [indecipherable] but primarily we would barter. And then Lithuanian person decided to, rather than keeping our place -- I don't think he was all right, I think he was like the F.B.1., he inherited a big house who was the -- the guy who does the slaughtering [indecipherable] and he moved the factory in his area down there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Who was this that inherited the house?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That -- thi-thi-thi -- that's the person that my dad assigned the factory to.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see. Now, he was Lithuanian, not Jewish.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: He was a friend of my father.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- he'd been a friend of your father's, so --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Sort of, so my dad said, okay, you be the boss. Here, I signed you over, here's the property, and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- we" ll be running the show.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But that didn't last so long. I was in ghetto about four years, from deg41 to deg44.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="14"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now what were your living circumstances in the ghetto?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Very bad, very bad. We -- it was a small house, maybe smaller than this one, they put in five or six families. The problem was the stove. Everyone wants to cook a little bit on the stove. My mother stayed home --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And each family cooked separately?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, what happened, we were one -- it was our family, it was a pharmacist who took away three girls and the mother -- the father took away. We had two people from Czechoslovakia who were son-in-laws and they lost their family, they stayed in the house. And two brothers [indecipherable] they were rabbis and they lost their families. So we all stayed in that ghetto. My mother was a very nice lady, but everyone tried to cook their one little pot, and there was no food, really was no food. We'd get frozen potatoes. My mother would make sort of a potato kugel, which is sort of potato pancake. We'd get horse and she wouldn't eat because it wasn't kosher, but she would make hamburgers for us. And --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: A-A -- she got -- she wouldn't eat the horsemeat because it wasn't kosher.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Right, but she --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- right, but she would make it for us.</p></p></dialogue>

Tried to make a garden there, we had a little area. Was pretty rough. But then that  <span class="page-break" number="15"></span> </p><p> didn't last long and they took them away to build a German airport in -- not too far, you know, the observation towers.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: They took who? They took --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: They took me.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And when was that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Also during the period of the fr -- while I was in ghetto. In other words, after soap factory petered out, we were assigned to do labor.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay. I see.

So they assigned me to build observation towers, prefab homes.</p><p>But the person in charge of it was a sergeant, German sergeant and he was a nice guy. He said I'm like a rabbit. I don't see what you do, he said, I'm looking other way. You got a birdie?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I thought I heard --</p></p></dialogue>

So what I did actually when I was in camp, I would risk my life and I would go in the farmers and then barter. I would get bread and some food. People gave me clothes, I would give it to them. And was very risky you know, they could shot me [indecipherable]. And -- but I knew the people and they knew me so they didn't want to be seen that I'm coming there, but somehow we [indecipherable] arrangement.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So we did that. Before that, I also risked my life, my -- we walked the railroad cleaning out sludge, and that was very rough, my brother, my sister. And she had already two years of commercial schooling. So I risked my life and I got -- managed to get out of this gate, and there was a young German fellow, I had a Bar Mitzvah watch, I bribed him. I said, take it. And then he took in my sister to work in an office as a -- whatever she did have, but she didn't have -- allowed this -- this particular job. Also was very sad as I was going to exchange, it was a ch -- Russian camp and the Germans would patrol, of course, tried to avoid them. This was very, very sad. It was so sad, they had the Russian prisoners there. And the people -- again, they would starve them to death and then they would take people very weak, they call them musselmens, you know, just like skeletons, and they would make him go to Russian cemetery to bury them.</p><p>But then the people -- and there was so many people buried there, the whole ground was soaking. Terrible. And then people -- they would shoot the guys who t -- who took them away.</p><p>Fellow said, here's my wife and kids, they would just shoot them. The Russians lost 30 million</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="19"></span> </p><p> people during the war. You probably heard before. Was really, really sad. The Germans would come in and rape the girls, burn the farmers. So the Russians came back and took revenge to [indecipherable] I don't think they did nothing, you know, just -- of course the Ukraines, the people who [indecipherable] and they participated with Germans. They would -- so that's the story there. I was a carpenter in Lithuania also in Siauliai. Fix up steps, you know, I learned how to do it.</p></p></dialogue>

And you're not -- th-they didn't give him a test anything else. And a carpenter, you know, I didn't have to be -- you start off with boards, and then, for instance, you pulled a big [indecipherable] you have 10 foot hammer so you knock it two or three sometimes [indecipherable]. In fact, I think the fellow I was under [indecipherable] was Catholics priest. So -- and he would -- they have a little bit extra soup after they wouldn't have enough, they would give us, and then we sit around. But we were not starving too bad in get -- in get -- in ghetto, we were okay food-wise. So --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, some of these people working at the airport were not Jews?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They -- the germ -- they were tradesmen, German carpenters, but we were their helpers.</p></p></dialogue>

But what happened, the reason again, people got very jealous of us because we were one of few families who survived. But my mother also went -- but then we came back -- several times would be raids. You know, people in ghetto, and they would take children and women. In fact, the person who stayed in our house, his wife disappeared, you know, and his three kids disappeared because he sent them away to the farmer and the farmer didn't bring them back, and that was it.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: 1-- I don't know what they did for plumbing, whether there was a hole in the ground or not,  <span class="page-break" number="24"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> you know, during the transporting. And we were separated and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Do -- do you know how long you were in --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, probably Leipzig f -- I -- I'd have to look at a map, I thought it was about 24 hours at least.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And this was what year?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was 1944.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: 1944.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And we were separated. My -- I didn't see my mother and sister, that was it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, separated how?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Men and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Men and women?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- men and women. And then we had to strip and we went to --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Now, were you with your father?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was, my father and my brother.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: We were together. It was not gas chambers, obviously. And in camp we slept three or four in a bunk to --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Oh, you had to strip and then what?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And then they -- they took away everything and I think they gave us the clothing which is striped, you saw the concentration camp. I think they also cut our hair and have a lausestrasse, as  <span class="page-break" number="25"></span> </p><p> you know, he cut you like the Marine Corps, but the middle one is sort of a strip they call the lausestrasse, which is -- in German means the street for lice, but you -- like prisoners, you know, was just a big strip in -- in the middle and assigned us numbers. I-I lost my name.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did they give you a tattoo?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, they didn't. At that time they stopped tat -- stopped st -- tattooing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And I remember being people from Holland there in camp. Why did -- I liked them, they were very gentle. But we were starving to death, you know. The ration maybe was -- I don't know how many calories, maybe 500, and so forth. And I don't how long we were there. You know, we didn't work. We were just -- we start -- we were still starving, you know, just -- and then from there --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So you were just there --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Just as a try -- a tr -- temporary assignment, temporary quarters or something like that. And then from there they sent us to Bavaria. Dachau. But Dachau is a hub, we were in the [indecipherable] camp. I -- I was in a camp called Mildorf, and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Now you went by train to Dachau?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, I didn't walk. So somehow -- probably by train.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And do you know how long that was, on the train?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, I don't know, in Germany it's probably a couple of days, at least. And there again, they stripped us, and they took away the shoes. Even before that they took away the shoes because I had a broken toe. A big broken toe. What happened while I was in Lithuania was you know, the snow and this -- the wooden soles and heels, but no rubber, so the snow would stick to it, so it</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="26"></span> </p><p> formed like [indecipherable] corner, and we walked in the railroad and I lift up a rail beam and somehow my leg twisted and the -- the rail came on big toe and it broke it s -- dislocated it. They took me to camp, the doctor was drunk, and by the time he woke up, maybe three or four days, he said, well, it's grown together. So that was it, I have a dislocated toe from account of that. But then we were in -- in Mildorf and -- terrible. We got paper clothes, no [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Paper clothes?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Paper clothes. And it was cold, no clothing, you know, we were freezing to death. And was a lot of raids, U.S. raids. And I was so --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You mean bombing raids?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Bombing, right. And I was so miserable I didn't care. I would just sit -- everyone would run for shelter, but I was so miserable I would just delouse myself. Really. And next to the border was a four engine German plane, but everywhere bombed by allies, but they left us alone, you know, they would raid, the sir -- excuse me -- the siren would -- is okay?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The sirens would, right, but I just -- you know, I was just miserable. And then they separated us again.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, were you with your father?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was with my father and my brother.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And your brother.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And brother. And we were working -- we were building actually Messerschmitt, which is the German underground airport.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, you -- you had been on the railroad before. Working on the railroads?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="27"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, we were -- repair the rail tracks.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, you were repairing the rail tracks.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: The rail tracks, but this time we were actually doing construction. We are building an underground airport for Messerschmitt, which is the --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So this was in the same work camp?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, the railroad was in Lithuania, repairing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Railroads are in Lithuania but in Germany -- after being in Stutthof they transported us to Mildorf --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- which is a part of work camp [indecipherable] Dachau, but was not really Dachau.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay, and that's where you were working on the underground --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right, as a carpenter. And my dad and myself and my brother, we worked together and we had to walk in -- you know, back and forth and -- but we -- and there were a lot of conveyor belts and people would carry cement sacks on their back, but the conveyor -- conveyor belts were not used. Hungarian Jews -- and in fact I picked up to -- picked up a little Hungarian because they would always worry about what's evening, and I couldn't imagine why people had to peel potatoes, the potato shells taste so good. Or back home my brother and I would think, all the crumbs from Friday night, we could have had a meal. And my dad got very disappointed, said, let's commit suicide. He really -- he felt it's not making it. But the end they left him in the one</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> <span class="page-break" number="28"></span> </p><p> camp and took my brother and me in another camp.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When -- when your father said let's commit suicide, what did -- how did you take that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, he was just miserable, he just --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah, and how did you take that?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: | -- I -- it didn't bother me. I was young, I just -- I didn't -- it's just -- it -- it didn't register.</p><p>Didn't register, but he already, because he lost from the Russians, you know, all his possessions, now they took everything away from him so he really was -- and he wasn't an old man, he was probably in the 40's, I just found out, he was [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But it didn't affect you mentally --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, no --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- as much --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- no, it didn't affect me. And I know -- I didn't know how my father took it, but it didn't affect me at all.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You think because you were younger?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah, absolutely. Right now probably would hit me. And we were carpenters, and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: N-Now this is you and your brother?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: My and my brother, and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And you're separated from your father?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: From my dad. And then what happened, we -- they moved us in the camp and they -- the housing was like bunkhouse, they dug a hole in the ground and they put a roof and put dirt on for insulation. So it was just like in the ground because it's cold out. But I remember they had kapos, which was a leader of the camp, and he said that he needs electricity for his bunk. And I had  <span class="page-break" number="29"></span> </p><p> tools, I had axes and so forth. And one time I went home and saw wires, so not thinking about, I took my axe and cut it. And the whole camp -- the construction site got dark. The Germans run around here, it must have been a power line, right now I thought about it. And I took the wire, [indecipherable] wrapped around all the wires and brought it to the camp. He never turned me in, they would have killed me right there. It was about -- they didn't know what happened. And he got electricity and a -- and our reward was he would give us ex -- a little bit extra soup. The soup was really watery soup and there probably was a couple slices of bread. Another thing happened to me once. I came back -- I was 16 and very skinny, and used to have selection. Selection is you strip half naked and a gentleman says -- there's left and right. Selections are very sensitive [indecipherable] among people who are in concentration camp. And somehow I sized up that he send me with the weaker ones. So I run away. I really run away in this particular camp. And the kapo ran after me. He beat me up, but I know how much, but in meantime he got somebody else, so to meet a quota. And we were with a lot of Hungarian people, Hungarians Jews, and they were very naive, I thought. They -- I knew the people [indecipherable] crematorium, I knew that's gas chambers there, I already knew about it but nothing you can d-do about it. And somebody said the Scharfiihrer [indecipherable] big pope or rabbi, he said it's too hard, the work is for hard, you'll be sending more people -- and s -- oh yeah, the Scharfihrer said something like that, but anyway, I was spared, I really was spared. And so one time I fell down -- I walked the scaffolding and a four by four was there, the whole scaffold collapsed and I was underneath that but my brother pulled me out, I wasn't hurt. And then became -- so I think we were there in camp maybe a year or so.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, did you know anything about your father's whereabouts when you were separated?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="30"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, I knew about my father's whereabouts, we would try to send him some food with some other people. I don't know how he got it. I knew it was November that he was beaten to death. I knew that. We got word and I start crying and the kapos give me a -- gave me a big kick in my rear, said look, you have to go on. He said, you can't bring him back. We knew that, that he was separated. I didn't know anything about my sister or my mother. Didn't know anything about them. So it's a story fact, when we were liberated we di -- we didn't know the right day he died, so my brother and I decided -- arbitrarily we picked a day because in our religion once a year we say a -- services for the person who passed away. And just recently I got record from my ca -- from a nephew. Now I knew when he was born, knew when he passed away. Which I didn't know before. And actually, in 1944 he was 46 years old. He was born ninete -- he was f -- he -- deg44, he was 45 years old.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So he was fairly young.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Very young. My mo -- okay, talking about I found out then I was -- I was -- you know, he pulled me out and then when the Germans retreated it was a famous march, you know, they tried to crew people together and we supposed to march. But nobody wanted to walk -- walk with me because they figured I would be a liability, I would collapse and they'd have to carry me. They put my brother in the former hospital and they beat him up and his whole leg was really cut up, you know, like a Y and they put him as sample patient. But luckily for us, I think it's sixth or seventh or the Third Army, U.S. Army came in three days before the camp management and [indecipherable] us to come. That's why we survi -- survived. And General Eisenhower --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Now, so you never started the march?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, the march never took place.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="31"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But you were scheduled to.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We were scheduled -- we were scheduled to it. And general -- so -- and then we were liberated.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Be -- before the liberation, before you knew you were going to be liberated, what kept you going?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, it ha -- kept me going, two things. First of all, my brother and I were together.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You were together the whole time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: All the time. We were not separated. Then, a friend of his who was in the sugar factory, she became a hostess to the German -- you know, whoever the management they had at camp, and whether she liked him or not she would throw over the fence her ration of bread so we would have more than the rest of them. So, you know, we were -- whatever it is, we felt we have a little bit more. Another thing happened. Whatever the slice of bread is, we would divide it in three sections so we'd have three meals a day. Some people would eat right away. Some people smoked, so that they trade the bread for some cigarettes. A lot of people had the runs, dysenteria, and that kills you right away. We would drink the coffee beans, we felt it helps us. For instance, my arms swell up like that, and was a fellow said he was [indecipherable] must have been a surgeon, he cut me right here. He cut in, let a drainage go. I was frostbitten. But my brother had a good sense of humor, so guess what he said? Things are going good, now we're being liberated. Meaning that we have bread and everything else. Kept us going because we were together, we have a little bit more and we're carpenters. The people who were not carpenters, they would die by the droves, because they would work nights. In the morning you'll see the whole -- just two eyes full of cement. They would run around the kitchen, maybe something</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="32"></span> </p><p> leftover, so they wouldn't get any sleep. And the Hungarian people are very naive, it really would make them mad. Like, we didn't have anything but probably shoes and a cup, and you see a person died, people were so -- see that all the teeth will move, you know, loose like. And [indecipherable] you don't need this -- you don't need the shoes, you didn't -- you don't need the -- the spoon, why don't give it to me? And I would get mad, I said look, this guy is -- you don't know how long he's live, leave him alone. I mean, how rude can you be? But that kept me going because we had a little bit more. But after the war was other problems, too. It's the [indecipherable] People -- we were starved to death so people ate so much and they died from that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Now, let's go back to when you were liberated. How -- how did that happen? What were you doing when you found out that --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: They -- what happened then -- our being transported in Feldafing, which is not that far from Munich --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: No, this was after you were --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: After liberated.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, but before you were liberated, how -- what was the first news you had that you were being liberated?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, no -- the guards disappeared.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The guards disappeared.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Disappeared, the gates opened up.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That was the first thing you noticed?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right, right.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="33"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Until then you didn't know --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I didn't know anything.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- anything was happening.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: But we did get word -- my brother did get word about invasion of Normandy. I don't know how he got it, but he -- we knew that the allies are coming soon. We knew that. But that kept us going. But other than that, it was routine, you know, we'd work every day. Work in the morning and come back at night and stay, get a little bit soup and bread, and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So the guards disappeared and the gates were open --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Open.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And then what?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And the American -- the -- the G.I.s came in and I took pictures and I'm sure I'm in a lot of them. Because I was, in 1945 I was 20 years old, I think my weight was about 90 pounds. And you know, we had a Sing Sing clothes with a lausestrasse.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: We di -- I mean they were very upset, very, very upset, but -- and they transported to this camp, which Feldafing initially --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah, well now before that, what -- what did they do for you when they came in?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They -- they didn't do much, but I think they started giving us more food.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I'm sure that we -- I don't know where the food came from, from the kitchen or something like that, we -- I really don't remember the way that -- what happened.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. So then you were transported how?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="34"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Again, I don't know whether by cars or you know, the army trucks and we -- at that time we were taken care of by UNRRA, which is the American relief org -- an-and ORT, a Jewish organization.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: What was the Jewish --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: ORT. ORT, it's -- I think was a trade organization which they -- and join -- Joint, which is Jewish something. Relief organization of United States. And actually, it was American G.I.s Jewish, just spoke Jewish and ask us [indecipherable] but were put in rooms. You know, maybe bunks, but we -- we got some clothes. Maybe army [indecipherable] but we didn't have the uniforms. And we were free to move around. In fact my brother started University of Munich, continue his e-engineering degree. And we were moved on, in fact have a -- being in camp you don't have any -- any documentation. I didn't -- I couldn't prove anything because everything was taken away. But one thing I have right now that [indecipherable] who is the mayor of Feldafing wrote a letter for me to the railroad people for me and my brother to get free passed to go to [indecipherable]. In fact, I think we even rented a room in [indecipherable] because he had to study there. [indecipherable] I don't know what happened. And [indecipherable] a train, we'd go -- min -- Feldafing is on Garmisch-Part-Partenkirchen, which is the German Olympics in the Alps. But that really happened. Really things were very bad, very, very bad, you know, we just ... other than that, a lot of people -- we were one of the worst camps. We had the rate, people would just die by -- by the droves. Other camps, lager 10 was a little bit softer, but ours was one of the worst ones. So --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Now, when you were in the camp, what -- felt -- felton --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Feldafing, tha -- after liberation, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> <span class="page-break" number="35"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, yeah. How long were you there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I wa -- I couldn't live in Germany. Somehow I felt I have to get out. I really had -- I sort of felt I -- I sort of felt that I have to get out. And what happened, I speak Hebrew, and my brother speak Hebrew, so they made me a leader in movement to go to Israel. They made me sort of a manager, and they gave me a card so we'd go there. But then the Israeli brigade -- a soldier disappear-appeared, name of Ithzak, I don't know where from. And we had meetings and I think I was in Germany, must have been about a year.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In this same camp?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Same camp.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: For a year?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And during that time you were recovering and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, I was recovering, my brother started going to school. I start to read [indecipherable] you know, I probably had other people read, study a little bit. I'm not sure whether I start to study English or not. But I was involved in this organization and I was really free.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you were t-trying to get ready to go to Israel?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, I really didn't know what to do. I have a very rich uncle in Africa. My -- but here --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Where -- where in Africa?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Johannesburg, South Africa. And my brother wrote a letter to him, and he [indecipherable] and it wasn't really nice. He said look, the war is over, I'm not making as much money, and we felt how dare you, here people are getting killed. Your brother got killed, your whole brother.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: This was your father's brother?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="36"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Brother, in Johannesburg. And he sent us five pounds, which is -- you know. And he said go back to Lithuania, at least you have a bed to sleep in. We did not, we never sent him another letter. We felt we are really -- so we were free. I don't know what I did really except being there.</p><p>I remember getting skis, skiing, we got a sailboat and had a washing machine. We lived in a villa. In fact, we lived in a villa [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And how many people were living in the villa with you?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I'm not sure, but we weren't crowded.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And I don't know about UNRRA, ORT paid for it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In fact, [indecipherable] it's next to [indecipherable] I remember it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right, okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In fact, I have a picture. We had a kitchen on there. And ORT decided -- asked me I want to  <span class="page-break" number="38"></span> </p><p> trade. So I was going to school learning how to be on the radios.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: To be a?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: A radio technician.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And we hired an English teacher, start reading English, but my English was lousy.</p><p>[indecipherable] but then I would take newspaper, and I bought a -- a dictionary and try to interpret the letters.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I just felt they are just -- they are just using the -- just -- I -- I -- it's just -- just lost faith in them. I just felt that I just -- I just didn't like them after awhile. I mean, I felt they shouldn't be in the black market. I mean, I shouldn't have seen it. You know whatever it is [indecipherable]. The American woman came in, they were all done with all make-up, I never was used to that. And now again a bad presentation, but -- so I was pretty busy and my brother was busy, he -- I th -- I'm not sure whether he was going to school [indecipherable] studied English and we st -- go to school, both of us went to be radio technicians or electronic technicians. And we stayed there til I came this country in November deg47.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="39"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, how did you get to this country?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: [have a cousin who lives in Washington and her mother -- I really don't know to this day, but I think her mother died and my mother was very nice to her. She raised her. And her dad came to this country and remarried, so she -- and finally he sent her papers. So she came to this country when she 15, was very smart. She sent us pictures when she was 16, graduated from high school.</p><p>And she kept ri -- writing us letters and send us 10 poun -- 10 dollars and said --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Now this was before the war, or --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, after the war.</p></p></dialogue>

We always had a lot of people staying in our house. I</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="40"></span> </p><p> guess we were considered well-to-do in [indecipherable] small town. So she actually bombarded us to come this country.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You and your brother?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, my sis -- she also took over my sister, but my sister was smart, Anna was smarter than that, she knew she didn't want to go to Israel. So she stayed in Germany and came from Germany directly to United States. And she came the year -- she bo -- must have arrived in "46 or deg45. She came earlier. So my sister already was in United States.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And did this cousin help your sister get here?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, yeah, she did.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So your sister was in touch with this cousin?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right, right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And how did you find out about your sister after the war?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I got word of her, she was somehow -- she was in Russia, but somehow the borders were not permanent and she managed to come to Czechoslovakia back in our camp. In fact, I had a coat for her, you know, a nice coat which I gave to her then. But she knew, my sister knew that she didn't want to go to Israel. She didn't -- she didn't want to, she -- she knew.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And how did you learn about your mother?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I never did. I never did. I learned through friends -- my sister never spoke about it, and -- but other -- you know, the march that never took place in our camp, took place in Poland, it was very cold.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And the story I got, that my mother and my sister were together, and they were walk -- and</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="41"></span> </p><p> my mother was younger. She -- she always -- anyway, what -- the story I got that my mother felt she couldn't make it, and she had a sweater. So she gave the sweater to my sister for protection and she probably fell back, and she froze to death. But she could have been, if my dad was 45, she probably was two or three years younger.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm. So, you had this cousin in Washington, and she said come.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right, she sent us papers.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: What -- what did she spend -- I think we also had -- I have friends, not relatives who very, very much proud of my mother from a small town of -- I'm not sure who send the money, but my cousin was administrator, she went to embassies and everything else, sent us the papers.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And that was in "46?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: deg47.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: deg47.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: deg47.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you came from Italy to Washington?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: New York, was Staten Island -- Staten Island?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And then they met me on a train, and I came to Washington.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm. So you came through New York, but you came directly to Washington?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Right, right. As a matter of fact, it was -- my cousin, she's a nice person but she -- I never saw corned beef in my life, you know, I didn't know that. She gave me corned beef sandwiches, but right now she's not telling me how expensive it is, I didn't know that. And even in Italy we had --</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="42"></span> </p><p> we -- somehow we had a suit made there and they put in lining to your knees, you know, you -- and I had a suitcase and we dyed sheets -- they have a cover for the suitcase [indecipherable]. So that was it, and so we stayed. We didn't stay wi-with my cousin at all, she had five kids. She lived North Capital, you know, where the printing office is, here under Union station. But we stayed with the friends of mine who had a small grocery store where Griffin [indecipherable] is, there where the [indecipherable] start, on Peace Street and Georgia Avenue, tiny little store. And we stayed with them and they were so -- I don't know, you know, we sleep -- slept there and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Now, were these people that you had known in Europe?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, they knew my mother. I never knew them, they knew my mother.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay, but they were from Europe.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, they were from the same town.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And then someone knew the owner of Giants, Greer Conn. The rabbi of my cousin knew Conn and they need people. So I got a job in Giants putting up stock.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And did you continue to live with these people that you started with, or --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I lived with them for a month, but then I lived with my sister for about -- til I got married.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>I got married in 1950. And my brother-in-law and my sister, she didn't have children, I would give my whole salary to support her. And my cousin Esther had a grocery store on the same street, so -- and after awhile I felt, I said I need a little bit more money for myself too, you know, I can't give all that. I started to working 54 hours a week for 27 and a half dollars [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Well now, when you came to this country did you know some English?</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="43"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I thought I did, but I spoke very fast and I probably still do. I thought I did, but obviously I didn't. And then I started going to Americanization school, yeah. And I got [indecipherable] Central High. And they liked me, they gave me a good recommendation, they told me [indecipherable] would take the streetcar [indecipherable] the streetcar.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And how did you meet your wife?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Youth Community Center, 16 [indecipherable] Street, it was a dance. She liked my red cheeks. And she was true American born, from the navy, and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: American born?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, very much, very patriotic. Pittsburgh. She came in "42, they drafted her to work for the navy, and we start dating and -- and I didn't -- I didn't really like to leave my sister. I didn't like my brother-in-law, he -- he made me sort of uncomfortable. Any evening I would eat, he would tell me how much a meal like that would cost outside. I just -- it's just that I didn't [indecipherable]. And he got a good break, because -- but I didn't like it, he -- he would just go -- we didn't have any money [indecipherable] washed and his nails done. I said gee, something's not right here neither. So I stayed with them til 1950.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you stayed with them til you got married?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And then we moved out to a rental apartment in southeast Washington.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm. Now you were working in the grocery store, and then what happened from there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, what happened was there people liked me. And what happened, I was putting up stock, but then I got wind if you be a cashier and if you worked a whole week and you come in within a  <span class="page-break" number="44"></span> </p><p> dollar, you get five dollar bonuses. So I became a cashier. I liked that. But then they promised me to make me assistant manager, or manager, but that never happened. Once [indecipherable] from United States run out, people from Canada came in. And I always was first fiddle, but I never could lead the band, you know, it always bothered me. And the hours are terrible. If they don't like you -- first of all, leave money, you can't -- if you have to go to the bathroom you can't do it, because it's money. And the managers play games with you, they don't like you. Like you would work from nine to nine, with two breaks. If they don't like you, they send you for lunch half an hour at eleven and then three, from three til nine, it's a long day. So I complained to my wife and she never told me what to do, but I cannot complain because I was [indecipherable] and one time she said, you know what, she said, you'll be gray and old and still be smiling to the womans down there. Because now a young fellow would come the summertime with shorts two sizes too small and throw yourself at him. So that's the register. So I went up at school in the Capital Radio Engineering Institute, on 16 and Columbia, and I said look, I have a high school diploma, I can't prove it. And I took the radio school, is there any chance for me to enroll in your night school? They say oh, we'll think about it. And then they called me up, said we'll you exam. And apparently I did well on the math part, because I'm sure my [indecipherable] was lousy, and they accepted me. So I told the manager I'm going to school. He was a good guy, he said I hate you. I said why do you hate me? He said, I have to rearrange the whole -- everybody's schedule to meet your school schedule, whole school -- oh -- and store [indecipherable]. But he did it. I mean, he complained, he did it. And I started going to school but I found out I didn't have the language, so I really was struggling the first two years, my grades were lousy. C minus, barely made it, but they didn't get mad. They didn't get mad, and</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="45"></span> </p><p> after two years I got the nick of it, I picked up very nicely. So I quit Giants and worked in various repair shops like Phillip's and George's and they fired me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So what was -- what was your training in the school?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It's sch -- 0-official training?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I think I'm equivalent to high school from back home.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And well, i-i-it was a trade that you studied?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I studied a trade in Italy, how to make radios.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: No, but at this --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, that was a junior college, the --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: A junior college.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Junior coll -- a technical.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Technical.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Technical college, very good with [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And so when you finished you had?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: You got associate degree [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: In?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In electronics.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In electronics.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In electronics.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay. That's what I --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And we had more electric --  <span class="page-break" number="46"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- wanted to understand.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- more subject than you get from a B.S. in college.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay, okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I mean, you got 80 credit hours. Strictly, the school didn't concentrate so much in math and -- but really to the point, you know, electronics lab, transmission, the whole nine yard.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So a lot of practical stuff --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: A lot of very practi --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- you could get a job with.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: More than practical stuff. Maybe not high powered math, but we could design th-the -- well.</p><p>In fact I was so naive I thought I can buy a television station now.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: We have to turn over the tape.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Sure.</p><p>End of Tape One, Side B  <span class="page-break" number="47"></span> </p><p> Beginning Tape Two, Side A</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Leonard Gordon. This is tape number two, side two. And did you have more schooling, or --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, I had quite a bit more schooling after I went to Capital Radio Engineering Institute, which I thought was a very good practical electronics school. I got a job in the navy, the David Taylor Model Basin, which is a resource organization. And I went to GW University and I took courses in math and physics and I became a professional person, I became electronic engineer.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>And during my third year I took awful lot of courses. I took courses in acoustics in Catholic University, American University. A lot of courses were given at our campus like speed reading, English, management. I was a government representative for contracts. Actually my career was very s -- very colorful, and I think I -- probably if I add -- add up all my courses, probably equivalent to a Masters degree in electronic engineering.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And what was your primary job?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In the navy I was a electronic engineer and my job was to design special equipment that we couldn't purchase. And it took quite a bit to do, I had to do some research development, because I was in acoustics and a lot of equipment was not available. In fact, I dese -- developed a system which I applied for a patent, but tat -- it so happened with [indecipherable] I never received it.</p><p>When -- and I was in charge of abs -- obtaining the whole system for the scale model equipment which we performed at a lot of experience in the [indecipherable] which is a [indecipherable] pristine lake. My -- I was charged with the work with the whole data acquisition system and analysis system. And this project turned out to be a very big success for the navy. As a matter of</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="48"></span> </p><p> fact, they're testing right now on the new submarines, the future submarines on the navy.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Could you talk about your religious life after the war?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, my -- I grew up the religious family, but that was a way of life back home, my dad, we didn't work on Saturday, went to synagogue, my mother would prepare all the foods on Friday.</p><p>But when I came to this country, not that I was not religious -- religious, but we kept a kosher home, but we would eat out -- out, and I would not attend as much the religious services as I guess was expected of me. Of course my son was Bar Mitzvah, my daughter was confirmed, we had a party. But after my wife passed away -- also, my son was going to Hebrew school, and then after Hebrew school he was going to meet [indecipherable] which was part of Hebrew academy. And I really never knew how much he knew as far as religion is concerned. But when my wife passed away I stayed with him for about a month and he observed -- in the Jewish tradition if we -- someone loses a parent, he observe for a whole year and say special prayers.</p><p>And here our son, in Orthodox synagogue conducting services, and I was very much impressed by it. And after that I thought, since my son can do it, I should be able to do it too. And as a result of it, I'm training, I'm doing various parts of the religious services in our synagogue. I'm conducting services in the evening. I attend Friday night services. I'm going in the morning for services, maybe not every day but I turned back to -- towards religion.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Have you been back to Europe since you left?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I -- I went in 1950, it was our 25" anniversary, we went to Israel. It was a very successful trip but in Europe I didn't have desire to go back. I was in business in England and one time, but I've -- really don't have any desire to go to Germany or to Lithuania. Reason being, I somehow cannot -- feel very uncomfortable being in Germany. In Lithuania I'm actually afraid of my life,</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="49"></span> </p><p> because even wa -- even though I was very young, I know the town. We were in a town about 30,000 people and I think about 8,000 Jewish people and I'm afraid that I'm living evidence that I'm alive and people might not be happy about it and I'm really afraid of my life.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And about your trip to Israel, how was that for you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I was in Israel twice. The first time I was with my wife and we were th -- there I think a month, and we were in [indecipherable] which I was very comfortable. We took tours. Of course, I did not live with the Israelis, we lived in hotels. But I was very comfortable, I could read a paper, I could understand the newspaper. And I was very impressed that people, Jewish people are sweeping the streets, and are doing maintenance and building equipment. Like the day we left, a person came in four in the morning and said, I'm a Jewish [indecipherable]. And he brought us coffee, I was very comfortable. Now, just last year, it's I think "98 I went to Israel, B'nai Brith for a month. And something happened to me, I got sick, Marge got sick, so I could not -- I could see but not as well, but I thought that Israel changed quite a bit. More competitive and I think I just -- it's really different when I thought it should be. People are more interested in what they can get out of you and which house do you live, they live in a villa. It just did not impress me that -- that's the country should be run like that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So would you say you were disappointed?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Somewhat. I really was -- what -- I was happy, I met a friend of mine who is a professor in Haifa University and he lives in Hallal, which is north of Haifa, which is a small farm. He was very happy to see him. Also, a friend of mine we see there, a lady friend, she gave me a picture from a high school, which I never had and she drove me around. She was very nice, but generally the fabric of Israel, it's, in my opinion it's changed quite a bit.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="50"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: People are more materialistic which you know the fir -- after two minutes, how much money do you make? And I felt it's not proper.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm. What about reparations?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, being in concentration camp, the German government I think was Eidenhower, decided to pay back for the atr-atr-atrocities that they did to people being in camp. But at that time I felt it's bloody money.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Wha -- I -- you said Eisenhower decided to do that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And a -- a -- no, Eidenaur -- Edenauer.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, Adenauer.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Adenauer, Adenauer. And I felt that it's bloody money, I didn't want any part of it, therefore I didn't apply. But recently, after I retired I felt well, a little bit of money would help. And I applied the commission, I wrote an essay, my experience in camp, and after several years it was accepted. And the people ask me for income tax return, and I read in -- in the Washington Post that if your income for a single person 16,000 dollars and a family 21,000 dollars, that your claim will not be honored. So even though I'm entitled to it, I doubt I'll get any money.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Mm-hm. Do you have some feelings about that?,,</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes, I felt my being in camp does not have anything to do with how much money I earned.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And I-I -- I don't know wha-what's the si -- situation is in New York, who is the executor and wh-who-who makes the policies, I really don't know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="51"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In fact just recently I spoke to my accountant and he said well, your income, it's old a -- old age pension and social security. And I felt I meet a criteria but he send away my papers and I was rejected saying under my circumstances they cannot pay me any renumeration for -- because I was in camp.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can we go back to when you came to this country? Did you speak English?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I thought I did. After deciding that I didn't want to go to Israel, I tried to learn English. I was in Italy then. I think my brother and I hired an English lady, which she gave us some le-lessons.</p><p>But I'm not sure how much I knew about it. For instance, five [indecipherable] I spoke very fast.</p><p>But I tried to interpret it, | would buy a new -- an English newspaper and a dictionary and try to make sense out of it. And then when I came to this country I si -- I thought I could speak quite well, but apparently people did not understand me too well. And then I tried very much, I took Americanization school, I took college English. I t -- I tried to learn as much as I can. I also tried very much to lose my accent, but apparently after pu-puberty, y-you don't have too much of a chance.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you worked hard at it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I really did. I married American -- person who was ma -- born in the United States, who spoke English at home. And she was American as apple pie. All her family are veterans. But -- we didn't speak any other language at home but English. And I didn't speak as much Yiddish, which is Jewish, with my sister, you know, occasionally we would do it. But I c-c -- I could not lose my accent, but I tried to be as American as -- as possibly I could be.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was it difficult for you to learn and adjust to American customs?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't think so. I think it's -- I'm very appreciative towards the country. I think they were</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="52"></span> </p><p> very helpful to me. I mean I -- they didn't help me that much, but they didn't hinder me neither.</p><p>For instance, I worked in Giant food stores and I told the manager that I'd like to go to school.</p><p>He had to rearrange the whole schedule, I don't know whether 50 people, 100 people. He said he hates me, but nevertheless it was just a matter of speech, he did it, and I had a chance to go to school at night, which I was very much appreciative of it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Now that -- probably I would not r-remain an employee Giants. So in general I think this country was very nice to me. I became a citizen after being married, without any difficulty. I didn't have any -- I di -- I wasn't -- I never felt I was being discriminated because of my belief, I worked for various jobs, on assembly line and never was mentioned that well, you're Jewish or something. I never felt discriminated, ever.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm. Did you have friends who were survivors?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, in the beginning we had friends because we went to Americanization school and we sort of huddled together, but after awhile these sort of -- each one went their own ways and -- I had a friend that moved away to Boston and then he ended up to Israel, he -- and I -- each -- after we got married each one sort of [indecipherable] friendship dispersed.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you talk about your experiences with your wife and other people?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not really. We -- it was not -- no secret, but we never dwelled on it at -- I was in camp there for [indecipherable]. If I would not have been in camp I would have been this and that. I was busy going to school and trying to do good on my job. And my wife worked all the time, she also tried to -- we had -- we had a little bit money problems raising a family, our incomes were not as big and we t -- we tried to get a -- our children as much education we can. For instance they went</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="53"></span> </p><p> -- they took piano lessons, they took dancing, they do everything which kids are doing. And we were involved into that but we never dwelled because we -- I was in camp, that -- that is just the past time and you just go on with life.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Your wife worked?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, she worked her whole life actually, she started off -- she was with Pittsburgh [indecipherable] and they recruited her in 1942 for the navy. And she would work late hours to support the fleet, typing by hand, you know, three and four pages, before we had a word processor, for [indecipherable] make sure that the [indecipherable] fleet has all the parts. She worked for, I think the air force -- I mean, the air -- the navy air in the temporary buildings [indecipherable] the Constitution. And then she worked there, but at that time I think women were not considered equal. And no matter what she did, all those people from the naval academy, or whoever they were s -- they took all the credit. So she actually got mad and got a job at the labor department and they recognize her ability and she did very well. She worked in personnel and she moved herself up very nicely.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm. Back to talking about your experiences. Did you tell your children what you had been through?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I ne -- I never -- I never shied away with it, but we never went to a lengthy discussion that I was in camp, or what happened. I -- they knew they didn't have grandparents and I'm sure they figured out, but it was never brought up. I heard my son one time wrote a very nice paper about the Holocaust. It was very -- I think he was a teenager, 13 or 14, I really don't remember how old he was. It was very thorough. I don't know where he got the information, but I wasn't the one who supplied him with the information.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="54"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Have you been to the Holocaust Museum?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Once. I was in the Holocaust Museum because being a survivor I'm getting -- and occasionally I contribute a little bit when asked, for fundraising. And oh -- I have sort of trouble, I get very emotional about it. But I was just recently where it was made a film about the Jewish brigade. People from Chicago and it was one soldier who was in the brigade. The film was okay, but after there was commentary and I thought that they said that General Eisenhower said that he would send people back where they came from. And I don't think that was true because I feel that I'm -- my life I'm -- my life to General Eisenhower. We were in camp, and we were li- liberated. I'm not sure whether it was the third or Seventh Army, but three or four days prior, the time that it -- people -- the camp authorities, so to speak, thought th-the -- the allied forces would come in. I don't think I would have made that three or four days. And General Eisenhower came to our camp, Feldafing was a hith -- Hitler youth camp, and after that they put in refugees they called displaced persons. And I was away from him maybe an arm's length. I was very much impressed with him. He was tall, handsome, with army boots and he was very much disturbed, his eyes were filled with tears. So I really don't agree what people said, that he want to send people back to where they came from. And also they mentioned that in the camp they were not Jewish and they were very upset. I'm not sure which camps the brigade came in, but our camp was solid Jewish. We were part of Dachau.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm. Well, I don't have any more questions. Is there anything else that you would like to talk about?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, shall we talk about my children?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="55"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My wife and I raised two children, Mark and Marcia. They were -- right now they" ve bor -- my son was born 1956, and my daughter in "59, and we're very proud of them. I think -- they're pro -- they are professional now. My son is a surgical oncologist and my daughter is a dentist. He went to Northwestern University and was a biomedical engineer. And then he had several acceptances to medical school. He went to Northwestern University Medical School, and then he did his surgil -- surgical residency in Cornell, New York for five years, and then he did a fellowship in Sloan-Kettering and now he's private practice in White Plains. I feel he is a very good surgeon and is a very good man. He published several papers. His paper was one the first ones International Congress in Toronto a few years back. I'm not sure where he's publishing now. My daughter again, she went to Washington University and she was double major, she had a teacher's certificate in biology and she was accepted in several -- early admission to several dental schools. She ended up going to nor -- Northwestern University and then she did a internship for the navy, I think [indecipherable] for -- for the navy, I think, there were about 90 - 100 applicants for one person to accept it, and she was the one. And she published several papers there. And right now she is practicing with her husband who is also a dentist in Baltimore. And I think -- maybe I'm prejudiced, but I think she is a crackerjack dentist.</p></p></dialogue>
