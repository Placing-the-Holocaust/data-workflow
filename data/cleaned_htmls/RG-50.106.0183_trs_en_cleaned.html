<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Where in Poland were they from? What city?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: From what I remember mother was always talking about Biata Podlaska.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He was in the leather goods, wholesale business. He manufactured leather goods like wallets, anything made out of leather goods. And actually we had a very nice house in Brussels but the factory was at the back of the house. And I remember coming home from school and often going up there and visiting with some of the workers. And it's really interesting because I must tell you that I'm 84 years old. And I've never talked about this before.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: We're very appreciative that you're doing this now.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And I felt it was time.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [had two grandmothers and two grandfathers. I remember them. My mother's mother lived across the street from where we were living.</p></p></dialogue>

And it must have been in the early 30s when they came. I remember my mother's father passed away and of course at that time we were too young to be allowed to attend funerals. And my maternal grandmother, as I said, lived across the street and I remember I went often over there to school. She was, used to fix my omelets, fried in oil, which seemed to be delicious at the time. For some reason my paternal grandmother, very sweet little woman. I remember her, but I don't remember where she was and where she lived. So perhaps she didn't live in Brussels.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What about aunts, uncles, cousins?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My father had a brother that I remember also, quite a bit younger than he, about ten years younger. And he came to Brussels at a certain time. And my mother had a sister and three brothers. She lost all three brothers during the war. Her sister had gone to Israel. I remember that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you live right in the center of the city?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes, I did. I lived close to the Gare de Midi I remember because we used to take the train very often, we didn't have a car. And we traveled either by tram or by train. And every summer mother and dad would rent a house at the beach, Blankenberg [ph], and the family would spend the summer there. And my father would come out on weekends. And it was nice. <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> Interview with Regine Ginsberg 5</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You mentioned that you had an older sibling, a brother?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [had a brother. He was seven years older.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And he was born in Poland?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He was born in Poland and I was born in Brussels.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And his name?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Jack.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Is that the name he was born with?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think so because that's the only way I know. In Belgium, it was Jack, which was spelled differently than the American so.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were your parents religious?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes, they were very observant in Belgium. Mother did kosher and kept the holidays. I remember the holidays very clearly. I really do. <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Regine Ginsberg 6</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Can you describe the holidays.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well Passover was just wonderful, because mother would start cleaning the house and cleaning the silver and bringing baskets of eggs and baskets of onions. And I really remember slogging kaports [ph] for the chicken. I mean it was a lot to do. I remember that before, and mother even would do, she would put the, she would make her own wine for Passover, because behind the barrier, and this is just now coming to me, there was also a big what would you call them, those great big jars that you keep wine in.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Barrels.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well it wasn't a barrel, it was made out of glass, but it was used and she would do cherries in sugar and they would ferment until Passover and it really was delicious. And I remember we finally got our own bathroom, because we didn't have one for the longest time. Not a bathtub, I meant my -- because, no because I think, if I remember clearly, we used to go to what would you call them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Baths, you mean public baths.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Public, yes. And for Pesach we all had to clean up. We all had to dress up and we all had to sit at a table. It didn't matter if it was 11:00 at night. But you know there was a sense of peace, really I do remember that. We never complained about being hungry. Mother must have had the family over because there was always more than the four of us but I do remember Passovers. I <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Regine Ginsberg 7 do remember Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur because the women and the men sat separately.</p><p>Mama and I sat upstairs, while Papa and my brother were downstairs. And I do remember my brother's bar mitzvah, how he used to have a rabbi that used to come in and tutor him but not me.</p><p>Girls were not as important at that time. Really. We thought that was very interesting. Now I think that's very interesting because he could read Hebrew and he had a good understanding even when he got married with his family and I never did. Until I was bas mitzvahed.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What language did you speak at home?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: French. Oh at home, Yiddish. At home we spoke Yiddish and when mother and dad didn't want me to understand they spoke Polish. And of course French was the language that I learned over there. I mean I went to school.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were your parents Zionists?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't know. [really don't know about that. I don't know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Let's talk a little bit about your neighborhood. Was it a Jewish neighborhood?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: If it wasn't, we didn't mix with anybody who wasn't Jewish because it was very interesting.</p><p>We all had identity cards and I don't know what year that came to be, but our identity cards were a different color than those who were Belgian and gentile. We had a yellow band across the identity card. And I was not allowed to mix with anybody who was not Jewish. <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Regine Ginsberg 8</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So you never played with other --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Inever did, no. It was ingrained in me. I don't know whether I thought I was going to burn in hell. It was a real scandal as mother would put it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What about the school that you went to? Was it a Jewish school?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, it was not. It was a public school and I very much remember my father walking me to school in the morning holding my hand. But I only did, I couldn't have gotten too much past elementary school because, well I went to school. I don't know how the school was divided over there. Because I was 14 when I left Belgium, but a very young 14, very protected. No independence.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I was going to ask you how independent you were.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No independence at all, no independence at all. I was under the protection of my parents. In fact now that I think about it, I don't think I was ever until I got married, without one parent or the other or both of them. Which is very interesting.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: What about any hobbies? Did you have any hobbies as a young --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Regine Ginsberg 9</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did you like to read? Or art or music or anything like that?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't remember studying, I did have a piano teacher that came to the house and gave piano lessons. I don't know that I was that interested in it. I did not became an artist. But I don't think they had the arts in school as much as they do now. It was mostly academic at that time because I remember I had a Latin teacher already because she would -- I remember one thing about her.</p><p>She read palms. And she read my palm. This was before the war. She said I would have a very short life and she was very -- and you know that stayed with me my whole life. And now that I'm 84 I'm all right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So in your class, there were Jewish students and non-Jewish students.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes because I remember we celebrated Santa Claus which was on December the sixth, a different time then, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Would you describe your childhood, your young childhood as a happy time or a relaxed time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't remember it as a happy time and I often tried to think why. My mother was a very beautiful woman. My father was busy during the day in his business and mother was gone when I came home from school. She loved to dress up, no she didn't work. She loved to dress up and go for tea in the afternoon. And she would come home later. I remember myself as being a lonely <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Regine Ginsberg 10 child because my brother was seven years older and I was always in his way. So that I don't remember a lot of family gatherings.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you have any religious training yourself?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. The training was at home. You knew you were Jewish and that's all there was to it. You practiced Judaism. You light the candles on Friday night. You celebrated the Sabbath. And I don't think mother celebrated the Sabbath on Saturday by staying home. And meditating all day long. I don't remember that. But I know that the Jewishness was ingrained in me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you proud to be a Jew?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Why?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because I was born a Jew. And I just wouldn't think of any other way and you must remember that I only grew up in Brussels until I was 14.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: We're talking about this young --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And a 14 year old at that time would be like an 11, 12 year old in comparison today. <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Regine Ginsberg 11</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Hitler came into power in 33. When did you start hearing about him or did you hear about him before you left?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The only time I started hearing about it that I would have become aware is that the -- a little later part of the, around 35 or 36 or maybe even 37. There were Germans who were fleeing German Jews who were leaving Germany to try to get to Israel and other parts of the world.</p><p>They would come through Belgium. And I remember that we had some of them for dinner.</p><p>Now how they came to my mother and dad's house. There must have been an organization that placed them in different homes for dinner, for hospitality. And I do remember that. And that was the only way I knew, and not realizing what the problem was because I really wasn't included in the conversation. But I do remember that there were German Jews who had run away from Germany and they were talking about some of the problems I'm sure. At that time. But there were many Jews who didn't believe that they would be touched. And obviously my parents didn't either because they waited until the Germans attacked Belgium. But my father was very wise. We didn't find that out until we were here. And I didn't find that out until, before my brother died, that my father in the 30s wired $10,000 to the Chase Bank in New York. And that money was here when we came to the United States. That was very wise of him. And $10,000 was a lot of money at that time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What year was that? <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Regine Ginsberg 12</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was sometimes in the 30s. Because by the time we came in 1942 apparently his hand writing, my brother told me had changed a little bit. They were giving him a hard time. But he did collect the money and he opened up a leather goods store in McKeesport, Pennsylvania.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Let's talk a little bit about the 1930s. And you said your first indication was when German Jews would come to your house. Did you know a man named Hitler at that point in the mid-30s, when you were 10, 11 or 12.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I might have heard the name but I think I was protected from hearing too much being afraid about too much, because again the atmosphere and the thought must have been at that time that it wasn't going to be so easy for the Nazis to overtake Europe the way they did. I'm sure that that's what was on their minds because I mean we really ran the day they attacked Belgium.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Up to that point though you just had a regular childhood --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Regular childhood, yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You played with friends, Jewish friends only.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Jewish friends only and I don't remember the playing with friends and I don't know why but I must have had some friends because I had some letters after the war from a couple of people who said they were my friends. <span class="page-break" number="11"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> Interview with Regine Ginsberg 13</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Hitler invades Austria in 38. Does that mean anything?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It didn't, it didn't register with my parents. And of course you know I heard about the Maginot line, but didn't do any good. They went right around it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Kristallnacht, the Crystal night when they destroyed synagogues</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No. No, no.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Your parents had a radio?</p></p></dialogue>

Mother, in those days you didn't sit down with your children and explain what the situation was and what we needed to do. You just said we're going.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: She tells you that you're going to --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We just started running. It was like we're, I remember the running. I don't know why we were running but I remember that we were chasing after a train that was leaving full of refugees.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>And that train took us to the southern part of France.</p></p></dialogue>

Your boy friends?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I didn't have one. God forbid. Mother would have absolutely (laughs) -- but no, I was just dreaming at that time. Those were dreams of a 14 year old.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: On the train, were there other people that you knew or --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I don't remember anything about the train. All I remember is running.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: To the station.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: To catch the train. I don't remember being on the train.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now we're in France.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Now we're in France. And we stayed with the farmers for a few days until they could relocate us. We were refugees in France.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was it in the south of France?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It's south of France, yes. And we must have been very close to Spain because they relocated us to a town called St. Gaudens where you could see the Pyrenees from the house. So it couldn't have been too far from where we were.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So it's still the four of you.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You know I have often thought about this feeling of survival. I don't know what their state of mind was then, but I do know by what they did and what they accomplished that they only <span class="page-break" number="18"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Regine Ginsberg 20 thought of survival for the children first and then for themselves and they were successful in accomplishing that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What about your brother, Jack. Was he, do you remember what his state of mind was?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He was very busy being unhappy because he had left a girlfriend that he loved very much behind and he was already 21 years old. And he really wanted to go back to Belgium. I remember that. He and mother were having some violent words about all of that because he either wanted to go back to Belgium or being able to, for her to come with us. But all of that didn't work out. So he was very busy being unhappy. But as far as doing anything, neither he and dad were allowed to do anything. None of us were allowed to do anything. We just waited.</p><p>Mostly. In that little apartment which was maybe you know a room and a half or something like that. We were given food stamps and that's the only way we could get our food. We couldn't buy it. We had to get it with food stamps. And I remember mother used to go get the little bit of groceries, that we had.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were there many other refugee families with you in that town?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not in the apartment where we were and I don't think that we were busy mixing socially with anyone because it was a bad time of our lives. We didn't know what was going to happen.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you see other refugee families? <span class="page-break" number="19"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Regine Ginsberg 21</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't remember seeing other refugee families. Except we were arrested while we were in St. Gaudens. And I'm not sure why we were arrested at that time. We were arrested by the French and we were put in prison, right there in St. Gaudens. I always had the impression that it was because mother's little town of Biata Podlaska might have been on the border between Russia and Poland. And perhaps at that time there were bad feelings between France and Russia.</p><p>I'm not sure. Or we might have been arrested because you know this was the Vichy government and perhaps that they were already working with the Nazis. Because the Nazis were really being very clever I think now that I think about it. They didn't want to do too much to the Jews because they wanted the Jews to come back to where they were living before, because for the longest time you would hear rumors. Come back to Brussels. They are not touching anybody.</p><p>They are not doing anything to anybody so my mother probably in 1941 and because she was a woman she smuggled herself back to Belgium. And she did salvage some of the jewelry you know. And she brought back her Sabbath candles which I have. She brought back my father's tallis ,which I have and she brought back my father's tfillin, the tfillin, which I still have also.</p><p>But she brought her diamonds, her jewelry. Not anything beside that. And she made it back.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did she tell you where she was going?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Regine Ginsberg 22</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not til we were in the United States did I know that story. I didn't know where she had gone yeah. When, to go back to when, the time we were in prison in St. Gaudens, I remember they walked us through the streets of St. Gaudens. And I remember the French people standing there and spitting at us. I've never forgotten that. And I thought to myself, I remember thinking what did I do cause I didn't quite understand. Mother and I were sent to a special place in Toulouse and dad and my father were put in a French concentration camp for seven weeks.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Your father and your brother?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And my brother, I'm sorry. My brother and my father. And mother and I were released because I was 14 years old. She had a child with her. At that time that was a child. Today it's a ganzer mensch. [ph - Yiddish] And I remember we went to visit my brother and my father and I remember that they came to the fence, also dressed in pajamas with wooden shoes on. They went to--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You went to their prison?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. It was like a concentration camp. It had barracks outside.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was that also in Toulouse?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It must have been somewhere in that vicinity. Now the story goes in my family and I don't <span class="page-break" number="21"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Regine Ginsberg 23 know if, and I don't remember it but they seem to remember that mother told them that she with, some of the jewelry that she had, she either bought off some of the principal there or the guard there and after seven weeks my father and my brother were released and came back to St.</p><p>Gaudens. We had been in St. Gaudens all that time. So I thought that's probably true because I can imagine that the French guards probably could be bought off at that time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And what condition were your father and brother in when they got back?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They had lost weight. It was a frightening experience for both of them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did they describe anything about their experience?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: If they did, they didn't do it in front of me. The protection was immense, it really was immense. Even when I was a grown woman we didn't discuss it and this is really from memory, going back and seeing some of these images from the past in my mind.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What did you, you're 15, 16 years old, what did you do all day?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Nothing. Absolutely nothing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you get out and walk on your own? <span class="page-break" number="22"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Regine Ginsberg 24</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, that I wasn't even allowed to do in Belgium. We really did absolutely nothing for two years that we were there. But my father had a first cousin in Squirrel Hill, Pittsburgh Pennsylvania, whom he had never met before. And he wrote him as soon as the war broke out.</p><p>Hymie Morovitz. They owned the OK grocery stores in that area. Very comfortable financially and he decided that he was going to save this family. So my father went to Toulouse which was not too far away and that's where the consulate was. And he would stay every day in front of the consulate to see if there was any news. And they would have ways really of arresting people for what reason I don't know, because I remember my father telling me that he would hear the whistles blow and he would run. But he would go back again in a day or two to see because of course we couldn't leave without a sponsor. And we finally got the papers in 1942.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What month in 42?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We left in June.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: These are papers for all four of you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: For all four of us. We left in June and in July two months, two weeks later all of France was occupied by the Nazis. They took over all of France. And whoever was left was sent to concentration camps. That's how lucky we were. We just got a -- we were the last boat out of France with Jews coming to America. <span class="page-break" number="23"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Regine Ginsberg 25</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did you have any contact with, or did your parents have any contact with the extended family when you were in this small town, your grandparents, your aunts, uncles.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: If they did, I did not know. I do know that my grandparents both died. I don't know how. Ido know I have a cousin, my father's sister left her children with nuns during the war. And I do see my cousin now. She comes to see me. I go to see her. And my brother. My mother lost all three brothers. In the war with some of, so their wives and children. She had one sister left who went to Israel.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But the ones she lost had stayed in Belgium? Is that what you're saying?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And the Vichy, I mean they were really very helpful to the Germans. They did everything --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So when you saw them, the Vichy people and saw them in uniform, police and so forth, what were your thoughts?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You know it's amazing because I see that in children today. We have the ability to unfocus when we are afraid. I see children do that today. They act like they don't see and they don't hear and I must have done the same thing. I just, I adored my father and I remember holding his hand a lot.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: When you were out on the street --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Mm hm, mm hm.

<dialogue class=""><p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Regine Ginsberg 27 nobody had luggage really. So they had fixed that with cots all over the place. I might be wrong but I remember that it was so small. It was only about 2500 tons the boat. And it took us six weeks to get to the United States. I do remember being very ill because we were walking a lot and we stopped in Casablanca.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was the name of the boat, do you know?</p></p></dialogue>

Otherwise the rest of it is locked out pretty much. I remember we stopped in Casablanca and we must have stayed there for a couple of days. I guess to replenish on the boat. My father who had a wonderful sense of humor and he was trying obviously to make me feel better was negotiating with an Arab trying to sell me.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Do you have any other memories of Casablanca besides the one incident of --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think we walked around a lot.

<dialogue class=""><p><p>We walked to the markets so we must have been there a couple of days.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: By that time did you have any more knowledge of what was happening in Europe or what Hitler was doing? Did you know about the conditions and what was happening to Jews?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You did not?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No and by that time I was already 16 but as I said a very young 16. Very young 16. It was not a time in my time anyway where the family would sit as the do today and talk and explain why we are in this situation, why we are doing what we're doing.</p></p></dialogue>

I think almost didn't dare ask. (laughs) So perhaps it was not like that in every family. But it was like that in my family. At the time growing up, I didn't ask any questions and my brother because we really were not that close until we got older.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When you were on the boat with all the other refugees, did they sit around and talk about what was happening and having to leave home?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [have a very lonely feeling. A very frightened feeling. By that time I was in my teens, but I wasn't doing what teens were supposed to be doing at that time. I wasn't growing up and I didn't have a chance to grow up. Actually I lost all of my teens here. All of them. I mean I didn't have the teen years that a teenager will have from the time she is 14 until at the time I got married.</p></p></dialogue>

And now that I think about my parents really it was a miracle. It was a miracle what they did. And it was a miracle what my family in Pittsburgh did because it was just as I said two weeks later that the Germans were, took over all of France. And arrested the rest of the Jews.</p></p></dialogue>

And we must have spent the day there too cause I remember they must have had some kind of a festival because there were young woman in their full dresses and young men. And I remember somebody telling me that if you wore a flower on your left ear you were not married. If you wore it on your right ear you were. These were the things that a young 16 year old was interested in.

So I remember her putting one down in my pocket and she said shh, don't say anything. That frightened me. And that's why I remember that. It really frightened me. I was very scared.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What did the Statue of Liberty mean to you when you saw it? Anything special?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. No, no. It didn't at that time, though I must tell you that ever since I came to America, I worship this country because I realize and I mean this most sincerely. What this country did for us and the freedoms that we had which we never had in Belgium when we lived there before the war. Because we were certainly branded as Jewish.</p></p></dialogue>

And I remember being asked those first questions. But I learned the language very quickly.</p></p></dialogue>

Did they ask you those kind of questions?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, because my language capacity was very low and I don't think I could have answered those questions at that time.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Besides the other kids asking you questions, about what life was like, were they friendly to you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, but it was a very difficult adjustment, very difficult adjustment for me.

I did graduate from high school, but I don't ever remember being at peace in high school because it was a different country, it was a different style.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Helping my father. My brother met a young woman from Kaufman, Texas and her first cousin was my husband. And he lived in Athens, Texas which was about 35 miles away. When she and Jack were engaged, she wanted me to come to Texas and meet the family and I came on the train, I remember, to Dallas, Texas. And there were four sisters and every Sunday cause there was nothing else to do they all had dry goods stores in the little towns. The four sisters would get together with their children and bring food or whatever and meet on Sundays and then go back home. So on one Sunday I went with the family to Athens. And there was my husband Reuben. <span class="page-break" number="37"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Regine Ginsberg 39 And the story is that he fell in love with me. The moment he saw me (laughs). And it was interesting actually. We didn't date very much. My mother was very anxious for me to get married. I was already 20 and 21 and I wasn't married yet. So there was an engagement party in McKeesport Pennsylvania for my brother and his future wife. And Reuben decided to come and we talked and then I went to New York with my father. I remember to cause he was going to Columbia law school. And I went to New York with my dad to help him buy inventory. And I met with Reuben again and he asked me to marry him. And it must have been instant because we had a beautiful marriage. We really did have a beautiful marriage, for 61 years.</p></p></dialogue>

And how he came to Silven, I really have no idea because his brother in Belgium kept the name Zylberstejn until the day he died which was just a few years ago.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So did your name then become Regine Silven.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did you feel about that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Had no feelings about it one way or another. If I did, it wasn't discussed with me. You know, it really wasn't something. You know you accept it, the facts as they came because you didn't question. I mean they didn't ask me what my opinion was. And that's just the way it was, that's all there was to it. And --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: The war was over in 45. Do you remember, have any memories of hearing that the war was over?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [have memories of hearing of the war being over. There is one thing that I must tell you that my brother enlisted in the army when he was here. He became a captain and he was sent back to Belgium and lived in our home in Belgium as a captain of the American army. And I thought that was just absolutely wonderful.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When was this? <span class="page-break" number="40"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Regine Ginsberg 42</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: During the war, during the war. Not after the war, during the war. And I remember his writing us that he was in the house and he was living in the house with other officers and I thought that was absolutely wonderful. What else do I remember?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Was he being used as an interpreter or --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes, actually he was in intelligence. Yes he was in intelligence cause he had had a college education. He was -- and his French was absolutely superb. He sounded like Charles Boyer. And he had his charm also. He did.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did he bring back anything from the house or did he say what condition it was.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You know actually I had, not from the house because I think everything was pretty well destroyed inside the house. But he brought me back and I still have it, a bracelet that has all the communities in Belgium, Rabon, I remember and the east coast, the names of the important provinces. And that was a long time ago. He brought it back to me in 1945, I guess.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And just to repeat when you were settled here you did not really talk about or did you talk about to your parents what you had all gone through?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No. <span class="page-break" number="41"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Regine Ginsberg 43</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Just turned the page --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Never. We turned it completely because mother was never happy, I don't think in the United States. She had a difficult time adjusting and my father had his first heart attack at 50 and mother was so afraid of losing him that she didn't allow him to, out of her sight. And I think that happened quite a bit in those days also, between husband and wife. So they were not, they never adjusted. I think it's very difficult in later age to adjust to a different country.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Imean they came in their 40s, they were in their 40s.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Mm hm, which shouldn't be too bad really, but they had a good life. They had a very good life in Brussels. And from then on, it was a struggle. From the day they left Brussels it was a struggle for them. And I do think and I hope they can hear me that they show such courage, such courage, both of them really of survival. That it's mind boggling sometimes. I mean do we still have that in us and I hope we do. I really hope we do. Because I think when you're faced with that kind of crisis you really don't know how you're going to react. But they just were incredibly courageous.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You graduated from high school, worked with your father and then met your future husband.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I graduated at 18 yeah. I must have met Reuben when I was 19 for the first time. Mm hm.</p><p>And at that time I was still a very protected young woman. <span class="page-break" number="42"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Regine Ginsberg 44</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Had you thought of going to college or was that not on the horizon?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was not on the horizon. It was not even discussed at that time. Why, I'm not sure.</p><p>Maybe mother and dad needed me there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Iwas going to say they might have needed you in the store.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think they might have needed me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And then you got married and where did you live? What year did you get married?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: 1947 and Reuben was in law school and we lived in the little community in upper state New York. I think it was called Nyack. ""m not sure. Nyack. And we lived in an army barracks and I must say that was the happiest time of our lives. My mother came to visit me and the first thing she said was oy veyzmer. His mother came to visit me, both of us and she said it's beautiful.</p><p>Pll never forget that. But it was wonderful. I would drive in with Reuben and I would take courses at Columbia University while he was in law school. And you know I adapted to marriage very beautifully because he was a very kind and patient and understanding man and I think the security and I don't mean financial security. I mean --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Emotional. <span class="page-break" number="43"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Regine Ginsberg 45</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Emotional security that I have today is really due to him, it really is due to him. Because I was a pretty messed up 21 year. I was afraid of everything. Thunder. Flying. You name it.</p><p>Going into a store. And buying something. Everything scared me really. But over the years, it's worked.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Do you attribute those fears when you were young to your childhood --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Absolutely, absolutely. And I had them for a long time in my married life. I can see, because we had actually two sets of children because there is 14 years difference between my son and my youngest daughter. So that we had my son and Debby and then Jackie and Lisa. And these two are not quite as hyper. These two, the first two.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So your first child was born when?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: My first child was born. I went home to mother because we were living at Camp Shanks, actually was the name of the place Camp Shanks. And there was a military camp at one time but in my ninth month. The beginning of my ninth month I went home to mother and Reuben must have had a feeling because --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Was he still in law school?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He was still in law school, but he came flying home on the evening that I went into labor. He just had a feeling. And Michael was born. He was such a Texan, my husband that he always <span class="page-break" number="44"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Regine Ginsberg 46 wanted to he was sorry he hadn't brought a little dirt from Texas to put on the table. He was a devoted Texan. And Michael was born in McKeesport Pennsylvania.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What year was that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Michael is 61 years old, so that would be 1948. I was so, so naive. I remember. We had a neighbor at Camp Shanks who explained to me at what period of time I couldn't get pregnant. It didn't work. (laughs)</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Speaking about 1948, what did Israel mean to you then? A large part of your awareness?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't think that I was brought, broaden in enough really to think about that part of the world. I didn't think about Israel until my oldest daughter went over there, when she was in high school and got caught in the Israeli war. And from then on I think Israel started having meaning for me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was the reaction of your parents when the war was over and the news came out about what had happened to the six million Jews and so forth?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You know I think they must have known about it. Because why did they want to run like that if they hadn't known what was happening.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The full extent of what had happened. <span class="page-break" number="45"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Regine Ginsberg 47</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Probably not the full extent, but I think they must have known about the extermination because it happened before, even. I think rumors have a way of you know coming around like a newspaper. They must have heard, maybe what was going on in Poland. I think that that was going on before 1940. They must have heard about the ghettoes. I don't think they heard the full extent of it. Of what I saw in the museum for example, yesterday. The outrage of the Americans and the British when they came, what they saw. I'm not sure that they saw, they knew it to that extent. They knew that they had to save themselves and their children. Now why did they know that. I don't' know. [really don't know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: My question was what was their reactions when the full extent came out after the war was over. The pictures --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: It was again something that was not discussed. With me. Which I find very interesting.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Too painful.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I guess because they lost so many members of their family. There. And that's the way they lost them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You had your first child and then how long did you stay in the east. Or your husband graduated from law school. <span class="page-break" number="46"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Regine Ginsberg 48</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well Reuben graduated from law school and nobody would hire him in Texas. They all told him to go west. And --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Why wouldn't they?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He just couldn't find a job. But he had a sister who lived in Tulsa and she found him a job with an attorney there and we moved to Tulsa with Michael and we lived there for about a year but Reuben really wanted to be in Texas. So we came back to Texas and you know those were the days that you really were living on a shoestring. But parents were always helpful. His parents and my parents and he finally found a job in a lawyer's office who gave him space for typing for the lawyer. So he typed a lot of his material and he didn't have to pay rent. And he grew very successful after that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What town were you living in?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: What town. Dallas. We were. We always lived in Dallas, yeah. That was in the 50s when we moved back to Dallas. And then we had Debby. And we lived in the little house in Dallas. And I must say those were the happiest years of our lives really. It was not complicated and then we moved to our big home that I'm still in right now. I started getting busy myself. I had a career. I was an art dealer. And in the 70s I had an artist friend who came to me who wanted to open a gallery. And I was interested. We worked very hard. We were never in the red. After about five years, I sold out to her. And Reuben who was very wise at that time, this was in the early 80s, insisted that I go back into business. And insisted on setting me up again but I worked out of my <span class="page-break" number="47"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Regine Ginsberg 49 house. And at that time is when I really made all the wonderful contacts that I made and have a wonderful art collection.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: These are paintings or sculpture or --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Both. Truly a wonderful, mostly contemporary art and I'm delighted because I think I have quite a legacy for my children. I also when I stopped doing that, I became interested in Golden Acres, which is a Jewish nursing home in Dallas. We formed an organization called friends of Golden Acres for the renovation that was very needed in the home at that time. Ethel Frankfurt and I who is now Ethel Zale, she married a Zale. Managed, we built such a successful organization, we managed to raise over the years that we were together about a million and a half and we renovated several floors really in the home. And I was president, I really loved it at the time. I did that in honor of my mother and father who both were in the home. I also was bas mitzvahed in 1992. In honor of my dad cause he had died and I wanted to do that for him. So that even though I didn't go to college, I managed to have two wonderful careers, one that I'm still enjoying because I love the art in my house. And I have some very good art. And that's one of the reasons I'm not selling my house because I get up every morning and it's still rejuvenating. It really is rejuvenating and my family loves to come over and I'm still very close to -- I have a wonderful family. Reuben passed away a year and a half ago. And they have just, everyone should be as lucky to have the kind of attention that I have had. Really. It, ""m blessed.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>lam truly blessed and as I said starting in the late 70s from the time I went into the art business and going on to what we did for Golden Acres has been very rewarding. Very, very rewarding <span class="page-break" number="48"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Regine Ginsberg 50 and I'm just so happy that I've had that time to have to have two wonderful experiences later in my life.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can we talk a little bit about your thoughts and your feelings now about what you went through. When your children were the age that you were when you had to leave quickly and being in France and that, 14, 15, 16, 17 year old age bracket. When your children were that age did it bring back memories for you. Did you relate?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Gail, it did not because as I told you when I started, this is truly the first time that I have spent any amount of time talking about my growing up. It almost seems as if my life didn't start for me until I got married and moved to Texas.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Two parts to your life.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, two parts to my life. And my best memories are from that time on. In fact when I went back to Belgium with two of my girls, I wanted to show them the place where I lived. And I couldn't believe it, it was condemned. For what reason I don't know. So there were no memories there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: My point was it didn't trigger when your children were that age. It didn't trigger memories of what you had to go through? <span class="page-break" number="49"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Regine Ginsberg 51</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Only because I was too young really to be able to impart those kind of memories at their age to them. And it was a time of my life that obviously I didn't want to think about. And I didn't. It affected me emotionally very badly, very badly and I think because it affected me emotionally so badly that I just closed it off.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't think that psychologically people of that time thought about those terms. Because if they did they would have sent me for counseling. That isn't anything that occurred to them really. Life was simple.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you parents become more religious when they came here or less religious?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Actually it was difficult to keep kosher in Dallas, Texas. Mama didn't like the kosher butcher. He was very mean. I remember that. The only time that mama kept kosher which really tickled me, holidays. Jewish holidays we had to be kosher and Passover we had to change dishes, the whole time that she lived in the United States. It was all right not to the rest of the week. but my sweet memories of Passover was that the day before you were supposed to get not the day, but the day that you were supposed to get rid of the hametz, [ph] mother always had for lunch, liver and potatoes, boiled potatoes and we had to come for lunch. And that was the end of the hametz [ph]. After that we started Passover. And you know I think it is so wonderful to keep up those traditions because it stays in the mind of children. Those are the things that really remain with them and how important it is. And I do think today that the Jewish institutions are trying to <span class="page-break" number="50"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Regine Ginsberg 52 go back to that.

When Adolf Eichmann was --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well that was already when I was grown up. Yeah I got emotionally involved in that. Yes I did get emotionally involved in that and I remember I watched it. In the sense of what happened through them because of them. I have several friends who were still living, who was survivors.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>They are the ones who really went through Dachau and the horrors of the concentration camp.</p><p>The experiments, the nakedness, the shaving of the hair, everything and but I told my children today at lunch that I really feel, as badly emotionally it affected me, in life it made me strong.</p><p>My experiences during that period. Giving me a strength that I don't even see in my children. I mean I really feel strong in crises. It's very interesting. I change completely in a crisis. I don't scream, I don't cry. I just internalize it and I become strong. And I'm grateful for that. And I really think it's because of my war experiences. Because I can't place it anyplace else really, that kind of strength.</p></p></dialogue>

The good old Jewish story. So that we didn't have much time together to talk and I regret that very much really. And I'm very serious that today my friends who still have husbands, who still have a brother, I'm like a preacher. I really am, Gail. I tell them I appreciate that what you have the time that you have together and don't stop and pick nit, you know the little things that are not important. Discuss your childhood.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Exactly. I mean don't do this and don't do that. You're going to get hurt.

That was one of the things when I came to the United States that I had never seen before where blacks were not allowed to drink from the same fountain or use the same bathroom. I really was incensed about that. I remember that because I had never seen anything like that. I wasn't there when the Jews were deprived also of doing that because we had left already. So I had never seen that before. And I remember telling Reuben, how can you accept anything like that. You know like that. I really remember having some very violent reactions to that.</p></p></dialogue>

And although it happened to several members of my family whom I didn't know that well. If I had been very close to them it probably would affect me more than it has. It didn't happen to my mother. It didn't happen to my father, it didn't happen to my brother. But it did happen to some very close friends of mine who have not talked about it, but Jesse was gracious enough a very close friend to let me listen to her yesterday.

All we can do is hope but that what you're doing is marvelous. Recording it. You know I listened to a lecture by the director of the Holocaust museum in Dallas who died recently of a heart attack.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: As I told you when I started this and when Jesse asked me if I would do this, is the time I started thinking about it.

The fact that you don't have to be recognized as a Jew or Mormon, any religion that you can practice any religion that you want to, that you are accepted. This is something that you should treasure because as a child growing up I really never knew that. And if you could just remember how lucky you are to live in this country. There is no other country in the world, no other country in the world where you can live and allowed to live the way you live in this country. And I mean that from the bottom of my heart. I've always appreciated that from the moment I set foot in this country because I've had a wonderful life here. I've lived in a part of the country that has been hospitable, that it was just a joy. And when I hear some of the things that are going on now I just can't understand it. But to my children and to my grandchildren and to people in general, cherish it.</p></p></dialogue>
