That would be all it is, freedom. The rest is, yes I came here with somebody I fell in love with. I was too young to calculate, is this gonna be better for me, let me get away from here. I still loved Europe, and my parents were there, so it was very hard to leave my parents. But coming here, it's freedom. Freedom to think and freedom just to walk, and not to be afraid.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: A very, very charming little woman we called -- everybody called her Bubby, and definitely she spoke only Yiddish to me. I mean, I was from Europe, I was Jewish, I spoke Yiddish, and that was it. There was no way that anybody could tell her, well no, she does not speak Yiddish. She see a Jewish little girl, she speaks Yiddish.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh. And where was this, in what city?</p></p></dialogue>

That is how I spend my -- the beginning of my life in America. And definitely playing the accordion.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Publicly?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, the moment people knew I play, I was invited to play.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Hm. And what was your life like the first few years you were here?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Youngstown, Ohio? Very primitive, very closed -- closed in, with not too many friendships. Nothing really going, but we were in Youngstown only a year, then we moved to Dayton, Ohio. From Dayton, Ohio, we were invited to see the capital of the United States, Washington, D.C. -- that was a friend of my h-husband. And I fell in love with that city, I said this is where I want to live. And my husband was very understanding and said, sure, that's where we going to live. We came here, started from scratch.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And when you were in Youngstown and then in Dayton, did you attend synagogue there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Ye-ye -- not too much. I did go with Bubby on holidays. She was very religious at home. So I more or less realized that even if they speak Yiddish, they're still a Jewish family. So that made me feel better.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm. And did you -- did you talk to other people, maybe other -- other survivors, or did people know your story?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I mean all -- all -- always looked for somebody who plays or sings, so we have something in common, because it started with my Nonna, you know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm. And -- and were you playing the old songs from -- from Europe?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They were mostly p -- Polish Russian -- mostly eastern Europe.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0073 ,</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The majority of them were eastern Europe, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: All of them spoke Yiddish. And some never even -- I mean, the majority didn't even know what Sephardic is. They had no idea what Sephardic is. And I lived with that very uncomfortably.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Why?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, that's what made me sort of feel very nostalgic for what I left, that I considered the -- to be Jewish. See, I came from the complete different community where I really spoke Spanish. That was their Jewish language.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm. Mm-hm, mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And all of a sudden here you are hearing a German sound, and I can hurt, just a German word would drive me crazy.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And it was all around me, all the company that came to visit, all the -- all the friendships, was all Yiddish.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So my big plus was that I spoke German in school, you see, in Zagreb where I went to school, you spoke German. I mean, you studied German. That was the language that is really a daily lesson.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm. So you could speak it, but you didn't want to hear it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="6"></span>  USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0073 deg</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The sound was scary. The sound was frightening.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Then later, I mean, I saw then I -- I came April nine, the Pesach, Passover was the -- the end of the month. My God, I saw the customs were the same, but the melodies were different. That again I was very nostalgic ab -- for the -- for the melodies.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: See, of -- of prayers.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: During those years in the Midwest, before you came to Washington, even though there were Jewish communities in both Youngstown and Dayton, did you experience any anti-Semitism there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I did not, because I didn't -- I didn't have a contact with outside people from family, and family friends. I didn't make these kind of friendships.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So there was -- no, I didn't.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And what -- what year then did your mother and father come -- stepfather.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, we went to -- t-to Washington, we lived in Washington, Betty was born 1947. I guess around deg49 - "50 they arrived to Washington, D.C..</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0073 "</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Had they been in Italy that whole time?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, yes, they were in Italy, in fact, they were going to stay in Italy. They -- they felt at home, they learned the language already and my father started a little necktie business, and she was sewing for people, and they were -- they were very comfortable in Italy. Italians are nice people. They're great people, they helped us a lot.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: A lot. So Italian people, I mean, when I think home, I m -- actually, I really think Italy more then Yugoslavia because that's where the problems started, so it left bad feeling, see? Bad memories.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm. And what was the adjustment like for them coming here? They must have been in their 50's or so by that time. It must have been harder for them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, they were 50's, the adjustment was very tough, it was all me, me. It was me and my children, that was their whole life. They didn't speak the language, there were no other -- there were about four or five families in Baltimore. And we used to drive them there on weekends, and then they had a good time. But it was lonely, just me and my children, that's all they had.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Children. At the beginning just the one baby --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0073 "</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- when they came.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And did your father work?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, they were -- th-th-they were very independent, very proud, and my mother started sewing. We lived in an apartment building in Arlington, and all my neighbors knew my family arrived. They went to -- right away to the immigration school, to English school. They take the bus to town, study English, learn English, broken English. My father found a job, Mayflower Hotel in the kitchen. And she end up with a job with Pearl Kirsner of Connecticut Avenue, sewing, alterations.</p><p>And they got themselves an apartment, N Street, Washington, D.C., very proud and happy, and old [indecipherable] place. And had a life of their own, which they wanted, they were very proud. [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: That's quite an accomplishment to come at that age and start over.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yeah, very proud. Well, survivor. That word means a lot, a survivor. A survivor has that touch to continue to survive. So it was in them, it was in me, and then -- then -- this is how it is. Most of the -- I don't know how many you meet, but maybe you hear that kind of a story. A survivor learns how to fight to go on. Fight for anything to continue. My music as -- as my story is, or continue go to school beca -- continue be a doctor, which is a hard school to go through, I know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm. Mm-hm. In -- in the 50's there was what they were -- were calling the red scare, here in the U.S..</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="9"></span>  USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0073 0</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: What kind of scare?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The red scare.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And the hearings in the -- in the Senate about a -- you know, the anticommunism hearings, and lots of concern about communism infiltrating the U.S.. What kinds of conversations did you all have about your former homeland, where communism had taken root in some form?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: A lot of our dear family went the communist way, the partisans --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- went to -- to the mountains, fought. For that time a -- that time in life, in their life, that's the only thing they could do. Again we go back to survival.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It's not always that the idea is born in you. It becomes part of you because of the circumstances around you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So that's what I remember. In fact, when we were interned in the Korcula, an island not far from Split, all my friends went to the mountains to be partisans. All of them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. And you yourself had made that decision --  <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> ontactrefiranneGaushariarg a hither atrmedortabeattfiexaliaton</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0073 8</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The only thing I did [indecipherable] back is because my father went to Split to exchange my little accordion for the big accordion, and I couldn't leave my mother alone. And she screamed don't leave, don't leave and they just left, all of them, the whole -- the whole bunch of young people. It was all around you, it's not what you are, it's what you become.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And after -- in the 50's, were -- did you hear from any family members or people back there, were you in correspondence with people that you knew?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No. [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: No, nobody.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, there was no connection with anybody. 42 of them in Vlasenica, in that little city, a mountain village.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And later on, as you know the story what -- I found what happened to them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm. What about anybody in Zagreb, or anybody -- friends?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Zagreb, yes I knew some families that were in Barre, where most all of them escaped and ran away to Barre. Not really personal contact, no. It was mostly Americans.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Especially after I had my second child, when Betty was already, I think two and a half, I wanted to be American in the worst way. I wanted to cook American, I</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="11"></span>  USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0073 "4 named my children -- Betty Lou, she hates that name. But -- she hates that name.</p><p>But that's what sounded good in America to me, hm. So I sort of didn't -- didn't even try to keep in touch with my people, as much as I wanted to be American mother. PTAs, you name it, I was right in it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Mm-hm. And --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I mean, that was -- would be the beginning of your interview, how we adjust.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>We're just really loving this country, want to be part of this country, didn't want to be a foreigner. And beside that, you just wanted to turn the page and start a new book. And you'd never go back, just go ahead and be an American mother, an American grandmother. They still call me Nonna, but I'm still an American, American Nonna.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. In the 60's in this country, did you have any response to civil rights efforts here, and the segregation and -- di-did any of those struggles resonate with you in any way? The minority struggles in this country that black Americans were having?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, yes, definitely. I had a heart for any immigrant in cun -- this country, because I've gone through it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The black, as you're asking, that was new to me. We didn't have black people.</p><p>It was very new to me and I had to adjust to that. I didn't know how to handle this  <span class="page-break" number="12"></span>  USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0073 "8 whole situation. So I didn't go into it too much, I'm not -- as much as I said survivor fights, but no, in that case, I stay away from anything I didn't know about enough.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. Did your children get a chance to know your mother very well?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How -- how long did she live?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. My mother -- well, they came 50's, Betty was just a baby. They were with my children a good 15 - 20 years.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: An -- and it was a Nonna who spoke of -- no, no, we -- I didn't want them to call her Nonna. She was their grandmother. It had to be everything very American.</p><p>And with the broken English, you know, accent. They were not ashamed of that like you hear so many stories that they're ashamed of their grandparent's ac- accents, because li -- by then I met lot of people who were survivors and the kids were very, very used to accents from all co -- from all countries. So in fact among us, my parent would speak to me simple Croatian, in one minute they would turn into a Ladino, or another minute in Italian.

But it really didn't. It really didn't. They didn't know anything about it. And the first Pesach performance for one of the Jewish organizations was a shock. And it followed many other shocks, too.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: A shock for who?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: A shock for me to -- to see how much this community does not know about their own brothers and sisters, only because they were born in a different place.</p><p>That's the only thing. One was born in Poland, the other one was born in -- in [indecipherable] see? So, I was asked to do a Pesach program. And my God, I brought all my songs from pe -- our Pesach. Eight days, there's a lot of singing you know. And I went through song to a s -- to another song and the program chairman comes and she says, do you know any of our songs? I said, this is our songs. And I was heartbroken, because I'd practiced for hours.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What did she mean by our songs?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Jewish songs. And boy, those were Jewish songs.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But in Ladino, Judeo-Spanish. But that is when I really realized I have to start all over in this country if I want to do Jewish programs. For awhile I gave up  <span class="page-break" number="25"></span>  USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0073 8 completely and I went into international singing. Italian, Yugoslav.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right after that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, even before --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right after that experience --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- no, I had that feeling even in Youngstown, that what I do is really not Jewish to them. Just not Jewish to them. And I do come from a -- Nonna was very pious, she was very religious. Very religious. So I -- she put into me way deep, and I end up feeling most of the Judaism through music again, through songs, see? So when she said, do you know any of our songs, I said, these are our songs. She says no.</p><p>And -- didn't know. And then my first -- now, these are my musi -- mu-music experiences in America, is what you're looking for, what a survivor f-felt at th -- I think this is what you wanted. There is an organization, Jewish study group in Washington, D.C., and I gave -- I was asked to do a workshop -- no, this was Jewish Folk Art Society. And they were giving a festival in American university, they asked me if I would do a workshop. So I remember it like yesterday, I introduced myself, come from Bosnia and all this stuff, and I am going to talk about Ladino songs. And I hear a student from way back, in a very student way of talking, what in the hell's that? I mean, we wouldn't put that in a book, but that's just the way it is. What in hell is that. So I explained to him. And after I did a  <span class="page-break" number="26"></span>  USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0073 &gt;&gt;" couple pairs, which are chanting pairs, another student says, well this can't be Jewish, it's -- it can't be Jewish.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So that was a tough experience. And from there on I knew, I mean you want to stay and sing and -- and perform? I mean, this is what all of the whole family did for years. You learn Yiddish songs. And I did.

Was no question about it. Why? That's what you do. My mother didn't have a kosher home, or she was very up to date with the ladies in Zagreb, they were all Ashkenazi. They all spoke German at home, and she didn't want to speak Ladino, so I went by myself, and I loved it. It was Ashkenazi synagogue, but the sound of Hebrew was peaceful, see?

Don't just - - don't sell me God, and He's -- protects you and looks over you and -- even in today I have a hard time sitting in that synagogue.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. Singing was mostly ba -- but I added to my singing a little story to every song, which I didn't before. In other word, if I would be singing Las Tias, the aunts, I talked about those aunts. Then I started with slideshows and I showed them Vlasenica, a whole f-family, pictures of each tia and got closer and closer int -- into this whole tradition through my songs, see? And I me -- I think my music has done everything for me, from the accordion that saved my life all the way to -- to today.</p><p>Now there are some wonderful moments, there's still disappointments.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm. When all the survivors came, mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The performers were invited to sing or play. Til almost three, four days before, I did not call because when you call and when you're performer, you're looking for a concert, and that was the last thing I had in mind, a concert, because I've done concerts at Holocaust Museum. This was to light a candle. Just a candle, because I was th -- at the Holocaust the spring, last spring, yeah this years -- last year, it's  <span class="page-break" number="34"></span>  USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0073 7 already gone -- to sing one song, I flew to Poland, to Auschwitz. And all the songs that I sing the Holocaust came to life because I saw the place where everything really happened. So I came back feeling very, very -- very emotional about the Holocaust survivors from Salonika, Greece, Turkey, Balkans. And I have a prayer, and I wanted to light a candle because the memorial at the Auschwitz was to -- to ma -- to -- in memory of these victims. So I wanted -- so I called a day before, I -- so it's too late, nobody called, nobody wants anything Sephardic, let me do something about it. So I called and I said, I don't want a concert. I had enough of that. I want a prayer and light a candle for these survivors. Two minutes. I had a plain flat no. And that was one of disappointments that -- that even happens today, you see? I mean, i-it -- it will never be that I can say, oh I'm so glad my Sephardic music is part of the Jewish music. It's still not accepted. And it's not that "m saying well, we died too, and the -- th-the eastern European Jews died, too.</p><p>[indecipherable]. Many more on that side than here? No. [indecipherable] to light a candle?</p></p></dialogue>

I don't understand --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- I don't know understand it at all.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- I'm trying to understand, I -- it's not so much understanding as not believing that this is happening. People who were planning something like this were not  <span class="page-break" number="35"></span>  USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0073 %8 really, as much as they really tried to -- they tried to, they cover -- I mean, they have exhibits, Jews from Poland, Jews from Greece. Ja -- there's so many days concerts in honor of a Greek Jew -- Jew -- Jews that's vanished.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And we saw the pictures from the train, straight to crematorium. Not even give them a chance to -- to -- to rest. Now, these kind of stories -- now, we talked to survivors who survived the Auschwitz, and I came back with this feeling that I, you know, feel terrible about this whole thing, and this is many years later.</p><p>Sometimes I say, why go back and even talk about this any more. But I was there, so I saw it. And I couldn't light a candle and make a prayer. I'm not blaming the Holocaust Museum. A person who was planning it did not have the knowledge to understand this.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Maybe because they didn't talk to anybody who just came back cha -- Auschwitz, okay?</p></p></dialogue>

We kicked out thousands of people because they didn't want to convert. And the young feel bad about that, because they're not more -- so [indecipherable] into the -- the religion that they could understand that like their ancestors. So they see this as a wrong thing that happened. But that's 1492, see, a long time back, you know. Many things have happened since. But all in all they do once a year a Jewish wedding, and all the villagers come over. And they do a really typical Jewish wedding. They sang all my songs. And ah, to me that was the highlight of life.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: They heard about me. They heard about me and they have invited, they made a [indecipherable] Sepharadi. A -- a -- a week, Sephardic week.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't think so. Israel has some neighborhood communities where there're old people, see? Atlanta, Georgia. California has a synagogue, you -- you -- right across the street with UCLA, I gave a concert there. New York has a small synagogue, half of them -- very few really speak a good Ladino. This Ladino group I have, some speak very nice, but are the French Jews, and it's gone.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: More people, mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It's more of them because a bunch of them came back, around 18" century or SO.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>

And you talk to somebody from Columbia, somebody from Morocco, and you have a good time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm, that's a great story. So by now you said that you -- since you went back to Vlasenica, you -- you know that your children know your story.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My children know my story, that's right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: They know the whole thing now.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They know why I'm doing what I'm doing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They know it is not stage only. Yes, stage is where you perform, but they know there is more to it since they see and hear my students performing, see? Since this ap-apprenticeship program, one of the apprentices, that's Susan Gaeta, she's already giving concerts in La-Ladino songs.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Now I -- lam now -- preparing a concert now with Ramon Tasat, who is Argentinean. I'm teaching him my Bosnian songs, we are preparing a concert. He will continue my work. So it will go on only through my students, more than my children.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Why so?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="45"></span>  USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0073 %</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because they are performing, they are preparing all the time, they keeping it fresh. The children, the younger one has two Gold gyms. She -- she owns two gyms. She's there from six in the morning, up and down, with fitness, you know, no time. Music is something that you set to practice. No matter how much feeing you have for it, that can come out only when you're performing. But to perform, y- you have to prepare. And that means have time, and leave everything else and make that a goal. When you have a family you can't do that. You have a business, you can't do that. You have distances to drive, you can't do that. This Ramon Tasat comes from Maryland. He comes tomorrow and day after tomorrow. He loses from nine to one, time. It -- it's -- it's time consuming, everything.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Now with the children, when they were living at home, you say, let's do this song, la, la, la, la, get a guitar. It was all in the room. But once they're married, in another city -- but they know what I am doing and why. They know it is not just stage and being a performer, it's -- there is a role to it, and I've done that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Through the -- through the four recordings, and that documentary -- I don't think you've seen the documentary, you saw the one at Holocaust. They definitely know what my goal is, teach and spread it. Music. Talking music. But if you doing this music, sooner or later you get interest into the culture of it. You can't help not  <span class="page-break" number="46"></span> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0073 &gt;&gt; to. So all these students I have, they know why I am teaching them. See, it will go on musically, I think. For how long? Who knows? But for me, to get in stage is, you know, no big deal any more y -- unless I can bring in a message. I have a song that is [indecipherable] di Spania, that I have written here in this country, and that's the key -- they key of Spain.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: See the keys all over, peop-people send me keys. It's -- it's all -- written on a legend that when the Sephardim left Spain they took the key with them. The key of the synagogue, the key of the homes. And that key went through generation to generation. It was always in their drawer. So the song is asking, where is the key that used to be in the drawer? And this is from Bosnia. That was already transferred to Bosnia now, left the key in Bosnia. So, the legend -- and this key took over among musicians a lot.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The song.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So two wee -- two -- a month ago we had a concert, the -- Georgetown University, an interfaith. And they asked me to do [indecipherable] di Spania. And the ambassa -- Spanish ambassador came and kissed my hand. You kissed my hand, I was thinking, you know. Look what happened. Look where we are today.</p><p>That's why I bring this trip to Spain, that they would invite me back. My songs are about Spain, and all our history is about Spain. And we love that country because  <span class="page-break" number="47"></span>  USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0073 *deg we love it the way it was, see? And that you transfer again through songs. I told you everything you'll get from me is songs and music.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When you went to Spain was that the first time you'd ever been there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. No, no, no, I went once before as an American lady, a tourist.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh. But did you have a resonance with it?</p></p></dialogue>

Not because you heard stories, or --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, I -- Pll tell you what --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- images or anything?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- a-as a survivor you become very realistic.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Romantic, yes, when you sing. Emotional. But you get realistic too. When yo- you go over there, there is nothing Jewish. For tourists, yes, they take you to a Jewish street, huh?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But it's not real.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's the big thing, the Jewish street. A Judaria. And a quarter buys [indecipherable] of that.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It's not the right thing to teach your children. The first time that came out in the open about this whole Inquisition business, it was always covered by the church, see? Was it here at the cathedral two months ago, I don't know if you read about it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-mm.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The national cathedral. Was a big happening in our lives that finally came out, the story. Not that you want to do anything about it. It happened five -- five centuries ago.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: This is couple pages in your book, in your history book. If you read history books, then you know about it.

So I -- I did drill a hole in s -- in -- in -- in ice. And I'm thinking what you want to know more about this country, America. I think we did cover some. I think we got something out of this.</p></p></dialogue>
