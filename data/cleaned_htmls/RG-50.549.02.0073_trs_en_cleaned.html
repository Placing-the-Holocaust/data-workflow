And the whole city, you could see the life of that whole community, that they left as it is. And every year -- now I don't know if this is a tourist's clique, or I don't know if it's a tourism to bring Jewish -- what's the word -- travelers, or really their own intention to teach their young, look, this is what happened. We kicked out thousands of people because they didn't want to convert. And the young feel bad about that, because they're not more -- so [indecipherable] into the -- the religion that they could understand that like their ancestors.

The children, the younger one has two Gold gyms. She -- she owns two gyms. She's there from six in the morning, up and down, with fitness, you know, no time. Music is something that you set to practice. No matter how much feeing you have for it, that can come out only when you're performing. But to perform, y- you have to prepare. And that means have time, and leave everything else and make that a goal. When you have a family you can't do that. You have a business, you can't do that. You have distances to drive, you can't do that. This Ramon Tasat comes from Maryland. He comes tomorrow and day after tomorrow. He loses from nine to one, time.

It's -- it's all -- written on a legend that when the Sephardim left Spain they took the key with them. The key of the synagogue, the key of the homes. And that key went through generation to generation. It was always in their drawer. So the song is asking, where is the key that used to be in the drawer? And this is from Bosnia.
