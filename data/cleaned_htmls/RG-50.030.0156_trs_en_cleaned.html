<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Would you state your name and birth date please?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My name Klaus Meier, and I was born on March 29 in 1932. I was born in Switzerland, near the city of Zurich, where my parents lived in a kind of a community, socialist, agnostic, semi-religious, because they felt that the only way people can live together in peace and harmony is by each one giving what he can and receiving only what he needs for life. My father will tell his own story. My mother has passed away already, but he was seeking for a long time to find this justice between people. As I said, I was born in a little farm there which they had rented. And while they were living in community there, they got to...into contact with another community which started in Germany 1920. I want to give a brief history of this community because it's important. Everett Arnold, a son of a missionary in Africa, sent there by the Amold family from North America had also had this great longing in his heart to find what the way of Jesus is, the way of justice, peace and love, which the prophets and the Tennah speak all about all the time. And after much searching and seeking, (clearing throat) passing through the first World War, he felt that what is told in Acts 2 and 4, that they were one heart and one soul should be lived and practiced to meet this need for justice and love and peace. He started in Germany 1920, and he was always on the look, this man Everett Arnold and his wife, on the look out for other people who had similar longings. So he got into contact with my parents on the little community in Switzerland near Zurich. My father (clearing throat) was ...uh...he rejected...he took part in the military in Switzerland, but rejected it. He couldn't see killing people as being just and so he lost his...all his possibility for higher paid work. And on this farm they were milking cows, working in a cooperative and so on. The community in Germany called Bruderhof heard about his stand of non- violence, his refusal of military service, his going to prison for this in Switzerland, and Everett visited my father in prison and later on had contact always tried to encourage him not to give up community. The problem was that in a socialist agnostic community like my parents were in...as my father says, there's always as many ideas as there are idealists, and unless you find unity in community it will break apart. The tensions are too great. So in this Swiss community, they didn't find unity. The question of education, how to spend the money, how to work, what to...what part to take politically, all these questions divided the members. Whereas in the Bruderhof, the community in Germany, there was a unity which was possible. You could feel it, but it was Christian and my father couldn't stand Christianity as preached by the big world churches, the Catholics and the Protestants. Well, when I was 10 months old, my parents...this community in Switzerland didn't dissolve exactly, but one couple after the other went..uh...because they were disappointed with the life of that community and joined the Bruderhof in Germany. And my parents joined that community in 1933, in February, a month after Hitler came to power. Right from the beginning...now this is what my parents tell me. Right from the beginning, Everett Arnold said to the whole community, to the members, "Hitler has come to power. Now we have to decide will we reject that nationalistic spirit? Are we willing to give our lives for what we believe or not?</p><p>And on this question, some left. My parents stayed. On...L...] had three other brothers born to <span class="page-break" number="0"></span> my family in Germany. Andreas Meier, my second brother; Hansjurk Meier, and Daniel Meier. I do not remember any kind of persecution in Germany itself, but I remember fear.</p><p>Just fear. And when I talked to my parents later about this whole question, they told me that already in 1933, there was six policeman who searched the community. Later on, in 1933, there was a referendum in Germany about whether....Hitler wanted to know if the German people support his policies. The members of the Bruderhof put little slips on the...on the voting papers, on the referendum papers, saying, "We respect the government, but we have a leader who is Jesus and we will not...we will serve only him." When the...5 days after this referendum which was in November I believe...uh...there was a big group of Nazi of Gestapo...Nazi soldiers and policemen came and raided the community. They took away books with red covers, proving that we were communists. They took away minutes of our meetings and...uh...so this went on. My father then was sent to take important documents to Switzerland out of the reach of the Nazis. My father was then sent with another Swiss man to the Gestapo headquarters in Berlin to find out what they had in mind with us. Everett Arnold always felt we have to go to top men to find out, and not to the second, third or fourth echelon in the power structure. In Berlin, my father went to the headquarters and they got in there which was also a fearful thing I think, and the man there told them that he had enough reason to dissolve the Bruderhof right because in one of our meetings, Everett had said that the Nazi state shows the character of all states, but it showed it clearest of being from the beast of the -- which accordins to CHristian beliefs in the book of Revelation is the <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> said, "Leave right away." But there was my mother 14 year old baby...and the weather was bad. There was some sick people. So we asked them to let us go when the weather is a bit better and we...so they let us stay there | day longer. And then I remember how with a bundle on the shoulder, we all got...they took us into buses and they took us to a train...I believe in Fulda. I'm not ...I'm not quite clear to which city. I think it was Fulda. And on the train, then they took us to the Dutch boundary and pushed us over the border. I've often wondered why my father went to the...to prison in Fulda for various reasons, the Nazis can't close the community as because they figured we were enemies of the state. But when they found out there were two Hutterian brothers and I have to explain this, present from North America, they changed the accusation into criminal bankruptcy to have a legal handle to get rid of us.</p><p>Now I remember these two brothers. And they are descendants of ...uh...people that in the 60th Century in Austria, Switzerland, Moravia, which is today Czechoslovakia, began a life in community like we live it today. And they were persecuted by the Catholics to death. By the Catholics, the Protestants, the churches and the governments. They found refuge in Moravia because hundred vears before this. _ there was a sniritual awakine and <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> any point with the Nazis. We did not raise an arm in salute. We did not go along with his politics. We didn't try to...uh... sort of inch our way in and be friends. We all...not I. | was a child. But the brothers and sisters and always said clearly where they stood.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How...how did it affect you at this point?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: As I said, I was 5 years old. I was just afraid. That's all I know, and from...from Germany. At certain times, I was afraid. And other times, I was a child growing up in this community very much cared and loved for.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you have any memories of what was going on in the community to your community that caused this fear in you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Uh...L...I'm told that also before 37, there were different raids going on. And my father was away often for the community in Switzerland finding refuge for the children. Later on in 35, when the general conscription started, he was off trying to help people. His absence I feel I must have felt that as a child. This is...this is what I can say. But apart from...from this fear I'm talking about, I had a very protected childhood. It was in...within the community, it was protected.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did the community protect you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I...bY the...I think it was by the...by the love and the confidence that God would led this...see this thing through.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did your community live at this point?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Our community lived on a farm. I'm not quite sure how many acres. They were farming.</p><p>They were learning to farm because in the beginning 1920, they were all city people, professors and intellectuals, but they were determined to ...to agriculture, and the farming was difficult. The land was hard and they had a lot of work needed to establish a farm. We lived in community houses like the kibbutz do today. We had our own school and preschool and kindergarten. Children were educated in their age groups by members of the community.</p><p>So the influence from the outside was very low or nothing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was the community self sufficient?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was self sufficient up to a point. We took...the community took in any kind of wayfarer...overnight gave him food and lodging. Asking them to work, which they did mostly rejected. We had many visitors, and economically we were doing bad. Not because...so much because of inexperience, but right from 1933 on, the Nazi government tried to strangle us economically. How this exactly worked, I'm not sure, but I heard that at one point they...they forbid...they didn't give us the license to sell our products. We farmed.</p><p>We had wood tannery, and we printed books. And the sale of books and tannery was part of <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> the cash income, where as the farm was the food. We...we never sold food. We always just grew food for our own use. And when the...when police...uh...prohibited us from selling then this took away cash and that made it difficult. There was a time in Germany when we had friends outside Germany who gave us money, which was stuck in Germany. I forget what the term is. They didn't allow foreign...foreign currency to get out of Germany, so friends gave us that money and the banks in Germany would not give us the money. So they made our life more and more diffuclt. We took in children from broken homes and needy situations, which the German government of the Weimer republic had paid for. They gave a certain amount of money. Well, this was stopped. And so here we were with the children and not getting an help either. So this is what made the economic situation very difficult and more and more so. They forbid guests of staying overnight which we didn't listen to. We didn't accept that. And...uh... (clearing throat) so now I think I got to the point that we came to Holland, and my personal story.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How old were you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was then 5 years. And I remember one of the Hutterian brothers carrying my little brother of 2 weeks....of 2 weeks of age in his arms, and my mother...we all had a bundle on our back and left. I'm very thankful that we could leave. Many, many others could not leave or did not leave in time. In Holland, the group called the Mennonites took us in very warmly. The Mennonites are a group that also started in the 16th Century and belonged to the so-called anti-baptist movement, and they started in Switzerland if I remember correctly, but fled to Holland whereas the Hutterians went to Moravia and Czechoslovakia.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How many of you did they take in in Holland?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think we were about 50 people. Let me say something. In 1933, we were about 120, but when the children had to be... had to leave Germany, we started a new community in Lichenstein. And members of the German community had to move over to Lichenstein to support this group of children. So that was also a weakening of the economic situation, to hold...to maintain two communities is much more difficult than one. So when the Nazis confiscated the place, I think we were about 50 people...children and grownups. Some when to the Lichenstein community called __ Bruderhof, and the others went to England where we had already started a community because of the tense political situation in Germany. The young men who received military service in Germany escaped illegally across the boundary and went to Lichenstein. And in Lichenstein the government was very friendly to us, and gave us refuge. And when Hitler started to put his fingers out for these resisters in Lichenstein, they let us know about it, and they said, "Get out of here fast. Hitler is asking about...not Hitler personally, but the German government." So when this happened we needed to find a place somewhere else to go to. And this place we found in German...in England. So as we left Germany in 1937, there was already a community in England. We tried to get into England, but couldn't because they wanted an affidavit of support, the British government. So the Mennonites took us in for 2 months, and they...we slept in their church buildings, in their homes. They gave us toys. They made collection amongst themselves for <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> toys, for blankets, for food. Everything they...they simply supported us for 2 months. I remember very well we never had any roller scooters if...if that's what you call two wheels on a board and a handle. In Germany, we...we didn't have enough money for such things, but in Holland, there were nice, black topped paths and roads and we got these roller scooters with rubber tires. Not wooden, but rubber, and we scouted around. That was wonderful. Now</p><p> (clearing throat) I'm told that I wrote a letter from Holland to my father who was in prison with the Nazis in Fulda, and in that letter I did...I didn't write, I dictated this to my mother saying, "If the government...German government doesn't let my father free, I'm going to come with the whole...and knock the prison down." My father received this letter in prison and everybody laughed about it. And then I remember when we traveled to England, we crossed the channel on a boat. And we were a group of 30 or 40 people...children, mostly children and...uh...some of our brothers and sisters from England came over to help us. And one of them was called Adolph Brown. He was a very hugh man, 6 feet or more, and quite a...quite heavyset, and he took...he took care of me and my brother because my father wasn't there. And I remember crossing the Channel on a boat. Then we came to England. And in Enoland. we had started this communitv called the Bruderhof. near --T'm not <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> also I felt as a child living in England. We had many air raid practices, living in the 3rd floors of the manor house getting into the bottom. I remember nackages of dried banana and <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> student union down here in Washington for 3 months and from there traveled with another brother to Canada, South Dakota, trying to find the help that we could immigrate to the United States. The government was very much in favor. My father breakfasted with Eleanor Roosevelt. She was in favor of us coming, but she said her husband needs to make the decision. There was different Senators who tried to help us, but there was a _ election campaign of President Roosevelt, and we were advised it's not good to come at this point.</p><p>Wait til January or February after the inauguration. As I think about this, the question comes why? Well, we all have clothing like I have it now. Black clothing, beards, which in those days were very rare. We don't salute the flag. I don't salute the flag. I have respect for the government, but I can't pledge allegiance for instance. It goes against my conscience. And so all these things made the government aware that it might not be a good moment to come in.</p><p>And then my father went to the Mexican government to see if he could go there. It didn't work out. And then the Mennonites again helped us to find a place in Paraguay, South America, which is in the heart of South America. We didn't know where this place was. We looked it up on the map. Now, my father was in America. I was still in England in the community. And when we heard we could travel to South America, Paraguay, we started reading books about the place because we'd never even heard of it. And we read about snakes and jungles and monkeys and...uh...diseases, all kind of things. And then the British government made possible for us to sell everything, get the value of it, and they made it possible for us to take everything we needed out of the country. And I and my family with...together with, I think, 70 of the community, we were on the first group. We left England in 1940 I think. 39 or 40, I'm not quite sure. We went...traveled in buses to Burn, to Liverpool, spent the night there in a hotel which I remember from...went to the third floor.</p><p>There was big beds and everything, but there was always the danger of bombers, of course, in the night so we had to be ready to...to run down the stairs and into the shelters. Nothing hannened that nicht. and I remember getting on to this shin called -- which the <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> from the oceanliner to the river boat, so that nobody could run away and get into Argentina.</p><p>So we traveled up this river, Paraguay Parana, 4, 5 days at least. Third class. It got hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter. We ended up in Ascunion, Paraguay, I think at Christmas time, which is south of the equator; therefore, it's the hottest time of the year. And then we transferred to another boat and went up the Paraguay River another 4 or 5 days til we came to --~ which is verv close to northern...to Brazil in the northern nart of Parasuav. There <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> 0 Chaco part is all brackish water, very hard, but bitter and to find a sweet water well was a rare thing. The other thing that concerned us as we lived there for 2 months, we heard that the whole Chaco is a military area under the...under the government of the military institution, which we also didn't like too much. Now, I remember as a child...oh, yeah. When we were there, my...let me think. I have three brothers...four brothers live in Germany, and in England a sister was born in my family, Verena, and then another sister, Hannabeth, and the third sister was born in the Chaco right there in the Mennonites...there with the Mennonites.</p><p>They had a hospital there. Our communities had brought 3 doctors who had joined the community in England, and they came out with us and this doctor was there, and helped my mother in...in the time of delivering. Other children were born there. So I would like to say that in this whole process of fleeing for conscious sake, there were quite a few things to consider. Pregnant mothers, little babies. These things. I remember meeting Indians in the Chaco. They were so-called wild Indians with loin cloth and...uh...the feathers they had in their hair, but they were all very friendly. And as I was told, these Indians also had a type of community life. They...if somebody got something, they brought it to the oldest woman in the tribe, and she would then distribute to each one as you needed. They cared for each other and helped each other. And for this reason, we felt quite close to them. My father tells me that he met some of the...of the leaders of the , of the Indian tribe, and they gave us some land. And my father asked him, "How much do we pay?" And the Indian said, "One dollar." And then the brothers asked shall we sign a document, the Indian said, "No. Shake hands on this. That's enough. We feel...we feel something from you which doesn't require any legal documents." In the end, we decided not to stay in the Chaco. It was too difficult.</p><p>The agriculture ___ was too bad. It was too hot, and then this military question played also into it. So then the brothers went to what is called East...east Paraguay, _ Paraguay, and there along side some other Mennonite colonies, we found a big...not an estate, a big...uh...cattle ranch. I think four thousand acres or something like that, maybe more. And the man wanted to sell us and we bought part of this. And we called it...it was called Priwara, which means Spring. So when this became clear, we all got on a truck and they drove us out on the truck to the train station. We got back to kilometer 144, drove to Kasaro, got on a boat, and went down 2 days I think...2 days and a night, to a place called Protorosario, which means Rosario Port, and there again Mennonites fetched us with their horse wagons. We drove 60 kilometers inland to this new place which we had acquired. There were no buildings on this place. It was nothing. It was just wild woods...uh...plains, swamp, and while the members of the...the men of the community start to build houses, we children stayed with the Mennonites in their schools, in their homes...I think again for at least 1 or 2 months. And then finally we could all move up to the Primiwara, and start our community life again. As I think about the whole thing, from the sake of conscious, my parents started from scrap just about every 10 years. In Switzerland were scrapped and they went to Germany, they started from with nothing, with the Bruderhof, and the left that, went to England. So and that is a difficult thing, to start with nothing, everything 10 years is quite something. Now in Primawara, we started building houses. Uh...In that country, there is a lot of timber, so we had to get timber. You cut the trees yourself. You can't buy it. You cut the trees in the forest.</p><p>You brine them out what thev call -- which is a contrantion consisting of two <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> 1 30, 50 60 feet long is balanced under this axle and the oxen pull it out of the wood and then you cut it up by hand. You can imagine this was all a lot of work for everybody. We built four big halls, a roof, no walls, no interior walls, and with just curtains separating the different families and there we stayed until we could build better housing. We started right away with agriculture, which is basically all we knew. We start with tannery, wooden tannery. In Paraguay, there's some wonderful woods, exotic woods, which make beautiful vases, sugar bowls, candle holders, things like that which people buy. So we went into tannery and agriculture. We started our own school there, and I remember that there were 3 woods. It's hot in Paraguay. It's sub-tropical country, and...uh...summer it goes up to 100, very humid. Every day a thunderstorm, and winter it goes down to 32 degrees, 33 fahrenheit.</p><p>There was a little bit of ice, no snow, but cold because we were not used...having hot weather all the time...to this cold weather. So in this place called Priawara, there were three wood islands. The first one...the first one we cleared and built a dining room, communal kitchen and a store house. And the second little wood which was maybe 100, maybe 200 yards away, was the preschool and the kindergarten (clearing throat) and in the third one we cleared...and I remember with machetes we cleared the cactus on the brush, and then we...there we built some school houses, school rooms, where all the children were educated.</p><p>We had our own teachers which we always wanted. We...we feel that in this community life, we want to have certain values. Values of love, peace, justice, and we...(clearing throat) we know that the teachers have to have the same values as the parents for a school to be...uh....wholeheartedly going in one direction. So this we had our own school with our own teachers. It was difficult, but other people died so simply by being able to live, it was a great...a great thing already. In Paraguay we stayed til 1960. I lived there for 20 years. I also lived part of my life in Uruguay, and also a country in South America, Montediveo.</p><p>(Clearing throat) While we were in Paraguay, there were some revolutions. There're always revolutions somewhere going on. And we were on the...on the battle line...uh...different parties winning and losing. They always asked us to help them supply wagons with horses to carry the ammunition and the soldiers. We always refused this. If a soldier's hungry, we give him food. If he's hurt, we'll help him, but we will not take part in furthering military objectives in any way. And this was dangerous. My father, again, was...he had to meet these officers and they threatened to kill him more than once by not...by refusing to help. But I feel that by holding on to values which one has, it's the best thing we can do. If one starts compromising, it gets...one gets on slippery ground very fast.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was the government's reaction...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The Paraguayan government was...is a Catholic government complete. The whole country is Catholic. They took us in because they needed people on the...on the land working agriculture. Paraguay is a country which lost...I don't know exact the figures, but they had a big war with Bolivia, Argentina and Brazil, and they lost enormous amount of people there, especially men and boys. So they needed people to come to the country. Not business people in the cities, but on the country. And therefore the Paraguayan government gave us religious freedom. We were not Catholics. They gave us complete authority in our villages. No policeman had any business there. They gave us freedom of school...of teaching children <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> 2 how we wanted, and they freed us from military service...uh...for generations. And this...this was...this made us very happy that this was possible. So the government was very friendly in that way. And we worked hard. We started an industry of...uh...wood saw...sawing logs, and this tannery and printing from...We worked together with a speaker, an organization from the United States, which helps third world countries improve cattle...uh...corn, soybeans.</p><p>Different things like that. They came to us, and we had some very good agronomists amongst members, and so they had a station on our land where they experimented to improve peanuts, corn, soybeans, and so on. So we worked with them, and that also helped us, of course. In the beginning, the cow...we needed milk for the children. The cows were all wild cows. They gave half a cup of milk if you were lucky. So we needed to improve the dairy, and this took year but it got improved eventually. For us children, it was actually a nice time. We never suffered hunger. We...we didn't get to eat meat, but we had bread. We had beans. This is fine. One doesn't need to live in big luxury to feed comfortable. We had the school there. We were cared for. There was a lot of sickness at first. Eye diseases....uh...tropical sores, hookworm, malaria. All these things happened.</p><p>But...uh...standing together and helping each other and supporting each other made it possible to get over this time. Now, the...the school was all in...in English I think. I'm not quite sure. In Germany, we spoke only German. In England we switched over from German and English. In Paraguay, it was German and English and then English I think and Spanish, so I grow up in three languages. That's why...that's why my spelling to this day is a little wobbly as Pooh Bear would say. So we had this school there, and we had 9 years of school to the 9th grade, and then I was asked with another boy...another boy from the community, to go to public school, to go to high school but you had to need, you need Spanish for this. So he and I went to Ascuncion, the capitol, where some other people were studying to be teachers. Uh...Mainly teachers actually we needed. We went there to what's called the Kindergrotto, 5th grade, which is the...the last year of the primary school. In Paraguay, they...I think they use a French system. Six years primary education, six years high school, and then six or seven years university. That's how the system works. So we were quite old,...uh...but we had to do this last year's primary education, kindergrotto. We didn't know any Spanish hardly, and we had...we had a heck of a time. (Laughing) Even in the State-run schools, they hardly had any...any...uh...notebooks. No textbooks, so the teacher dictated. I remember writing everything down as fast I could. They speak very fast, and then I went home. He...my friend and I and asked help of an older man from the community who was studying to be a teacher. He tried to decipher what we had written down so we could learn it later. And I stayed in this community in the...the Bruderhof house as we call it for quite a number of years trying to get this education. This Bruderhof served a number of functions. In Paraguay you can't just.. uh...order something and UPS brings it. It doesn't work like that. It doesn't work like that, so all the buying and selling went on in the capitol and then you had to organize transport from the capitol to the colony. And especially in the beginning years, we had to buy sugar, the soap, the wheat. Everything had to be bought in the capitol and then transported to the colony.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. They're changing tapes. <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> 3 End of Tape #1 <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> 4 Tape #2</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So this house which we had in..uh...in Ascunion, the capitol, was a building which we rented and later bought. And this study was the young people studying, mainly to be teachers or going to secondary school, high school and maybe could be compared to high school. We also had some people there. We had a...store, where we sold tanned goods from the...from the community in the country. And we sold quite of these tanned things out of wood. Mainly tourists, Americans who came through brought these. We also made there orange juice, concentrated orange juice and sold it there. And this capitol also, all the business was transacted. As I said, sugar, flour, soap, matches, all the things we didn't make ourselves.</p><p>Cloth. All the things we didn't make ourselves had to be bought somehow and then transported up to this colony which we had. To get from Ascunion to the colony took about 2 days...a day, a night and a day. One night traveling with a little river boat, maybe...yeah..to</p><p> and then a dav""s travel with a horse wagon from the nort to the colonv...to the <span class="page-break" number="11"></span> 5 the country, and we never wanted to live for ourselves, for our own edification, for our own salvation. That is not our purpose. Our purpose is to show everybody that people can live in peace and justice and harmony together. That this is possible right now. And we are... am not better than anybody else. I've got the same inclinations, temptations in my heart, but the question is where do I call it...where do I say stop? And living in community, having this goal of love to each other...a true love which admonishes which helps. This kind of love is what actually every human being longs for. And so we did never wanted to live for ourselves. We wanted...we hoped that we can be a witness to other people that the life and brotherhood is possible. To Catholics, to Protestants, to Jews, to Moslems, to Agnostics, to Atheists, it doesn't matter. To bums to rich men. And so when these people came from North America, they asked many questions. Why you do this? Why you this? And this is good for us. We need to see what we're doing also through other people eyes and...and see if we are still true to what we want to do. And so this was good. In 1954, I think, well we had people then in the States traveling all the time, meeting with interested people. There was an intentional community movement in the United States in the 50s, and so we visited these people and some wanted to join and some said, "You're too far away in Paraguay. Why don't you start a community up here?" So in 1954, we started a community in New York State near...between Kingston and Poughkeepsie. There's a little town called Roseton, near Newport, and there we bought some land and some houses and started Hutterian Bruderhof where people could come and see if they were ready to join or if they wanted it all, and so this was very good. (Clearing throat) Now back to Paraguay. I went to school and then I went to University. I was training to become a doctor, a medical physician. And as I said, there were different revolutions going on so when I was in first, second year in medicine, there was a big upheaval in the university and South American altogether and also in Paraguay. The students are active social movement. They...the young people protest injustice, the political oppression. And so the students were always in a... in a revolt, you know, ina stir, in a commotion, asking for justice. But one day the police came and closed the university down because the government didn't like this social upheaval. They called it communists. And...uh...so the closed the university down and the Brother decided that I should go to Montediveo in Uruguay to continue with the studies. And so I went down there and finished up later on. And it was in Uruguay, the little community called there called Eldorado, about 10 miles out of Montediveo, where the...where we started another little community. It started just with a few people working in a dairy farm and then we felt it's better not to be employed, but really start a community so we did that. We bought, I think, maybe 20, 30 acres with some housing on it. We sent families down there. Because we wanted to be near..near a place where people...where we could talk to people and meet people. We didn't want to live for ourselves. And also in Ascunion, we didn't find enough places for the young people to be educated in different things, and so this community in Elarado, near Montediveo, Uruguay was supposed to be another center for young people to go to and train. Maybe I should say at this point that in our community we, the children born into the community are not members. There's no automatic birthright membership. The young people they are born there. They grow up and we try to give them as good education as we can which varies. In Paraguay it was very limited. Here in the States, we're very grateful for the education into high school which is free of charge. But this wasn't so in <span class="page-break" number="11"></span> 6 Paraguay, so...so these children as they grow up, they...they get educated. They get to know what this community life is all about, but then we're very interested to let them experience how other people live so they can come to a decision seeing both sides of the picture, so to say, and come to a personal decision. If you want to join in the Bruderhof, it cannot be for..for the parents" sake. It cannot be for brothers and sisters. It can't be for a good life which we now have. We have a good life now. It can't be for any kind of...uh...comfort. It can only be for the sake to show the people can live together. And we found that if we do what Jesus said, it happens. Now, I want to go back to the time in Germany. When my father and I and a group of others visited Israel in 1985, we knew that the question of the Holocaust wold come up and there our Jewish friends asked, "What do you think of the Holocaust?" And my father answered after a moment of silence...I was there. I heard it. He said, "The Holocaust is a judgment on the Christians. Because (clearing throat) all the Germans who did the killing were nominal Christians. Catholics and Protestants. And I know that Jesus did not say kill your enemy. He didn't even say kill the handicapped. He didn't say kill the imbecile, the mentally handicapped. He said love your fellowman which is told in the Tennah by God himself. So this...this love is what we need, and so therefore we said in Israel and kibbutz Hasara in 85, "It is a judgment on the Christians because they did not do what they said they were." (Clearing throat) And then my father went on to say, "But if we Christians and you Jews don't take a lesson, don't learn from this Holocaust experience, the Holocaust will come that takes all of us." And I think the present day world situation is just about that.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. I went back in 88 once. We had gone again to Israel, invited by the kibbutz movement to visit them. We stayed there 3 weeks and then back to Germany. And I remember going to the train station there and I had all these memories coming back from 1937. (Crying) So I remember that. We have a little...I hope it doesn't matter if I skip around a bit. So this was the answer my father gave about the Holocaust. Now for the last few...since | year we have started a communitv in Germany again in Bernba. near Frankfort. in the _ And we went <span class="page-break" number="12"></span> 7 life.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Is the community still in existence?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. In Germany, we are still holding on. We don't know how to go, but we're still holding on. We have no permission to build. We have no...we can't do a thing because the village authority hasn't given permission yet. But we hope it will mellow. We heard that the place we bought in Bernba was a real Nazi center for Nazi, you know, so maybe their spirit is still there. Personally, I don't think that the Nazi spirit or this hate spirit can be eliminated by killing the people who represent it. I heard that Cohan was killed...murdered yesterday or two days ago. And he was...he was very right wing and...and hateful to other people, but I don't think killing him kills the spirit he was serving. And this is...this is what we think all the time. And it...on the Bruderhof. | remember that the brotherhood which we called <span class="page-break" number="13"></span> 8 no time for a marriage. But when she came up in January 1962...1 came up in November 1961...(clearing throat) we decided to marry. And when I say we, I mean my wife and I and the whole community because all such actions are take...the decisions are made together.</p><p>And so we married in June... 24th of June 1962. (Clearing Throat) We had a...it was a wonderful occasion. Then we had two children in Connecticut and then we were asked to move to our community in Pennsylvania which had also started. Maybe I should say here that (clearing throat) when we decide free willing...when I decide free willingly to become a member of this community, I declare my readiness to serve wherever it's needed. So I can work in the shop making toys for children. I could clean bathrooms. I could work in the dining room. Where...wherever I'm needed. I don't want to fulfill my gifts specially. I'm here to serve. And so in this sense my family moved to the Pennsylvania community, and I worked there in the shop. I worked in the school. And then in 1972, we moved again to the Connecticut community 1973 to be with my father, my mother, and the parents of my wife.</p><p>Thev were getting older.
