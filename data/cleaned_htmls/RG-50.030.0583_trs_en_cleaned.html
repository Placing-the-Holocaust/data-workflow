<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How do you remember your family life, when you were growing up?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> </p><p> Interview with Harry Iticovici deg August 24, 2010</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, we were privileged, I think. I was privileged in many ways because the time of the Romania was, after first World War, and the economic situation was good, and my father business was good, so I didn't have to work. So th-the only thing I had to do is to go to school.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And what sort of a -- did you live in an apartment, did you live in a house?</p></p></dialogue>

We learned French in school, then the Italian in school, and then privately I learned English.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And why did you privately learn English? Why was -- did your parents think this was an important thing to do?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, because if -- the idea was -- part of it was that when you -- in Romania, if you leave there, and you are a s-specialist, either you are an engineer or an architect, or a doctor, you have to travel. So if you have to travel, you have to know languages.</p></p></dialogue>

According to the Romanian constitution, in high school -- you see, the high school was not like here, everybody goes to the high school. You had to take an exam to get in the high school, it wasn't compulsory high school. And according to the constitution, every student had to have religious education.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see. But the Bar Mitzvah was not required, right?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no, it was not required.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No, you -- did you decide you wanted to do it, or did your parents decide, do you think?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: So I learned a -- a Hebrew little talk  <span class="page-break" number="6"></span>  Interview with Harry Iticovici " August 24, 2010</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Uh-huh.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I--I don't know. I think that the influence of my mother was that -- you see, my parents didn't have an education. So I had to have an education and I had to be what they used to call the liberal profession. Which mean either a lawyer or a doctor or an engineer or something, you know. And there was a certain pressure to become a --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: A professional.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: A professional, right.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> Interview with Harry Iticovici " August 24, 2010</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Were -- did you resent it?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We played soccer when we were 13 - 14, and then later on we played volleyball and basketball.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And basketball?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He couldn't go to the regular school, the ji-- state school. You see, i-it was very important to go to state school, to be able to pass that -- the examination, the baccalaureate, because that gives you rights to go to university and become an officer in the army and so on. The baccalaureate was very important in the -- in the -- with the -- with the numerous [indecipherable] you know, and they started saying that the Jews cannot go to the state school, so the Jews formed their own high schools. Now, I understand from Radu that later on they recognized those schools, you see, after the war, you see, in the -- they went back -- my brother went back to the regular state school.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see. But that was after the war.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you grew up with that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yes, no question about it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you join Jewish -- any Jewish groups at the time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I--I was -- only for a short time when we -- we used to play basketball and volleyball -- well, that was later on, | was member of the Maccabee, that was a sports group, Jewish sports group.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Killed, right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm. So you get your baccalaureate, is it 1940?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And your -- so you're 18.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Right.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="10"></span>  Interview with Harry Iticovici " August 24, 2010</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right. And -- and by then there -- there is a clear Nazi influence in Romania, is that right?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, it started -- this is probably -- you see, there was a lot of resentment in Romania in the -- because Poland was divided in 1939, you know. And the western powers didn't interfere. And the king felt that he cannot rely on the western power, so he made the compromise and let the Germans come in. And he also made another compromise, because he appointed the government wi-with these anti-Semitic groups. And the -- the influence of Germans, and the influence of the government, they started this that the Jews cannot have business, the Jews cannot go to universities, and so on and so forth.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Wa-Was there also some law against citizenship for Jews?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So did you lose your citizenship?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Now, no.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No, okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Now let me tell you about this. There were a number of laws in Romania that allowed the Jews to become citizens. In the -- my father was a soldier in the World War I, and he got a citizenship because of that. But then they -- they withdrew it, or they review it or something and he had to go to court again to get it back.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And did he get it back?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="11"></span>  Interview with Harry Iticovici " August 24, 2010</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think so, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So did that make you safer?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It didn't.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, because when they introduce this [indecipherable] and it seems that you could not be -- have a business on your name, or you cannot go to state run school, or you cannot go to universities. Was a matter of religion, not of -- of citizenship. See --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I see.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- because you see, when the things got bad, everybody got the passport, you see, and a --and wher -- I got -- I had a Romanian passport, my parents, especially my father, didn't want to leave.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, he didn't?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. He was not a [indecipherable] and he was in the war in Romania and he felt that his place is to stay in Romania.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But he couldn't have his business any more, is that correct, or not?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He --I don't remember what happened with that. Most Jews in business, what they did, they had the nom de plume, you know what I mean? Just a Christian guy name, and they were running the business, see?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>

The only other place you could go was Switzerland, and the problem was with Switzerland was that you had to deposit money in advance that you are going to have enough money to finish your school. So, we didn't do that.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="16"></span>  20</p><p> Interview with Harry Iticovici August 24, 2010</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Were your -- since your father didn't want to go, was your mother and father upset that you wanted to leave?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My mother was -- he -- she felt that the -- she was concerned that if I stay there, I'm going to go in trouble.</p></p></dialogue>

When Antonescu became pri -- pri -- premier, he -- and the king left, you see, there was -- he brought in the Iron Guards, which was an extremely radical group who was also anti-Semitic. And there were stories of the Iron Guards going in homes and picking up people in the streets and so on and so forth, and my mother was very c-concerned that I'm going to get in pogrom -- in a pogrom, and she got -- now, my father felt that if I leave, P'll leave forever, you know that, he wasn't really keen about that.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But your -- your mother was more protective of you in a certain way, so she wanted --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- so she wanted ans --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My mother was -- if I went in the evening to -- you know how boys are, they go out in the evening?

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes. So what -- what were these meetings like, that you -- when you went to these meetings?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, these meetings were primarily -- my understanding about this was that these people, there were originally I think 10 or 11 or something, they decided to buy a boat from a Greek person who built this boat as a sailboat for races -- racing. This was a racing sailboat. And I think he was in importing and export of grain, th-the Greek guy. And they decided, th-that they are going to -- to buy it, and so they were organizing the -- they were talking, where are we going to get the maps, the boat head, a small engine. One of the guys was supposed to be a knowledge of mechanic, and he was supposed to take care of the engine. And then where are we go -- th-the -- what kind of luggage we can take, you know, we're not supposed to take luggage because there was no place, just socks, you see. And then there was a lot of talk about, if we leave in the winter or spring, the rail -- you see, this boat -- and this is why we had trouble with, had a big mast with sails. And to keep the mast up you have to have a keel under -- under the boat. And the question was, how are you going to use the sail if in the winter when the rail where the sail goes up and down like a zipper is going to freeze, you see? So they were talking about all these things, you see?</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="18"></span> </p><p> Interview with Harry Iticovici " August 24, 2010</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And did you have a particular skill that they were going to use, or you were just going</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I-- there -- there -- as I say, there was one guy, a mechanic, and there was another guy, I think, who had some experiences with -- with boats. No, they made a decision right away that they are going to take captain and the sailor that na -- as navigators and that's what they did.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, let me ask you something: did you know what was going on in terms of the actions against Jews in Romania at that time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Sure.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You did. And did y -- did you want to leave just because you thought it was going to get bad, or did you -- did you want to leave because you thought you actually could get killed?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I wanted to leave because I wanted the different life, where -- whe -- where -- let me -- let me kind of give you an example. I-In Romania that time, if you were a Jew, and you needed some papers, you had to pay money to some intermediary and he will give you the paper, or he will give you a passport [indecipherable]. He had connections, see?</p><p>And -- and he continuously was -- for instance, to give you another example: the Jews</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="19"></span> </p><p> Interview with Harry Iticovici degs August 24, 2010 were supposed to give money to the government, you know, some kind of a like a special income or something like this, income tax or something like this. My father didn't want to go and argue with them, and I went with -- with my mother in front of this -- and this was Jewish people who were trying to get money from the Jews. Also, there was a question at that time about moving Jews to Transnistria. You know about Transnistria?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Ta-Talk about it a little bit.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: What?

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So all of these things, in-including the life even before the influence of the Nazis, and their [indecipherable] you -- you wanted --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, you see, it was a combination of the Romanian government, be-because they a -- they accepted the German [indecipherable] without fighting, and these anti-Semitic groups like the Legionnaires, that they adopted the German policies against the Jews.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you talk to your brother about leaving, or not?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you didn't want to take him.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I felt that I can risk my life, but why should I risk his life?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So, who bought the boat? Everybody who was going --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Everybody contributed some money. There were some people who contributed a little more, a little less, I don't know what was the -- the deal. I don't -- my father never said something, but he paid some money for that.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: He paid some money. It's expensive to buy a boat.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, this I did it only in the evenings, about three times a week. Let me tell you the background of that. In Beirut there was a commercial attache. I think his name was Berkovitz(ph), or something like this. And when the war started, he started this program on Radio [indecipherable] which is the radio in Beirut. And you see, at that time, beru -- Lebanon was a French protectorate. And when the -- after the [indecipherable]  <span class="page-break" number="49"></span> </p><p> Interview with Harry Iticovici * August 24, 2010 collapsed, these people in -- in French colonies, the protectorates, bec -- affidavit to de Gaulle, so it became France Libre. And Dr. Berkovitz(ph), who was [indecipherable] embassy was running a program in Romania from the Radio [indecipherable]. And he had another gentlemen then that I don't know what happened, he got sick or something, and then he asked me to do this three times a week, or something like this. So I used to go there and get the news, translate them, and deliver it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Before this, when you were going and getting your -- your essentially the Bachelor's degree, when you were going to college in Beirut, before you started your medical school; the war is still going on, so are you hearing a lot of news, or there's not -- there's not much news? What is it like for you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So, from 44 to "45, I think, right?

Is that correct?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I had this job, right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes. So, you are getting all -- are you getting a lot of news about the war at this time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="50"></span>  Interview with Harry Iticovici "4 August 24, 2010</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And you -- do you know what's happening in Romania?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I didn't know exactly what -- Romania and I didn't have -- there were -- there were once -- there were not many Romanians -- the Berkovitz(ph) family was -- there was the doctor, the wife. He was a doctor in business or something, you know, he wasn't a medical doctor. And he -- and there was a son there who was a student in medicine at the French school. See, in Beirut there was a Jesuit French university also, and they had a medical school. So this guy, his name was Zaporta(ph), he went to that school. So I knew him, I --1-- we're kind of friendly. But there were not that many Romanians there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you find out about the Nazis killing so many Jews in concentration camps and death camps? Did you find that out during the war or after?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, to some extent. I -- I never liked that culture. I didn't take German in high school, and I didn't like Germans, I never buy a German car or -- ye--I1--I---I---I---I was influenced by these things, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So what -- what happened made a big impact on you in some way.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah. When -- when you couldn't stay in Beirut, and these professors wrote, these American professors wrote --  <span class="page-break" number="51"></span> Interview with Harry Iticovici degdeg August 24, 2010</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- to Johns Hopkins, did Johns Hopkins have a division in Utah? Is that why you went to Utah, or --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Tell you the relation. You see, the -- the people from -- one of the people from teaching neuro-anatomy in -- in Beirut, which | think he was from John Hopkins, I did some translations for him from Italian to English. Some research -- he was interested in the pituitary gland, and I did some resear -- some translations for him, and I think maybe -- maybe he was the guy who wrote the letters, I don't know who wrote the letters. But the way this happen is that one of the John Hopkins professor, by the name of Maxwell Winthrop -- he was a hematologist, you know, at John Hopkins, became chairman of the department of medicine in Utah. Now why -- how that happened was that Utah before the war had a two year medical school. And then after two years, they had to go usually to Chicago to finish medical school. Now, because of the war, they decided to make a four year medical school, and then they had to get chairmen -- you know, professors. And they got this, the Maxwell Winthrop from John Hopkins as a professor of medicine. And I think that he was Jewish, and I think that they approach him, and Maxwell Winthrop had relation with the Jewish community in -- in Salt Lake City, and  <span class="page-break" number="52"></span>  Interview with Harry Iticovici *deg August 24, 2010 the Jewish community there had a fund that was left by somebody from Colorado, a Jewish businessman or something, for scholarships or something like this, and they decided to give me a scholarship. And this is the way this [indecipherable]. But that's not only what happened. It's -- to come as a student in those days to this country, not only that you had to have some kind of a scholarship, but there had to be a guarantee from somebody, that if you run out of money, they will contribute for your expenses in school and so on, so that you don't remain penniless. And they c -- this was done by a family of eye doctors in -- in Baltimore. They did the guarantee, but they didn't give me any money or something. The money was from that scholarship from the Jewish community in -- in Salt Lake City. And I paid it back when I -- after -- later on.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Had you wanted to come to the United States?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, I wanted to come to finish medical school. You see, this is something -- it's something that -- once you start something, you have to finish it, and I-- I -- I started this and I had to finish medical school, you see, so it was very important for me to finish medical school.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But you -- if they hadn't said that you -- they couldn't guarantee your safety and you had to leave Beirut, you would have stayed there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Probably, and perhaps made a life there.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was never interested in Middle East culture. You see, this goes back to the background in high school. As I told you, there was a very strong French influence, and western -- western interest [indecipherable].

And so I took this job in Houston for two years, a fellowship in the Texas Heart Institute. And my wife, again, the practice -- she was in practice of psychiatry, became to such an extent that she didn't want to join a group, or something like this. And she decided to get the training in psychiatric administration. So she took a two year, went back to school, to a Master degree in public health, with emphasis on administration.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How do you think it affected you? I mean, besides the fact that you -- you ended up leaving?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: First of all affected us, I think, that we went in medicine, you know?

And also, the  <span class="page-break" number="59"></span> </p><p> Interview with Harry Iticovici deg8 August 24, 2010 fact that you had to do a lot of [indecipherable] changing and shifts, gears, so to speak, you know? There was a lot of that during the war, and you had to be very persistent to -- to be ab -- to -- to get out of school with a degree, you know? And a lot of people advise me, why do you have to go up to medical school for so many years? Why don't you become a -- a bacteriologist or a physiologist, or something and so on and so forth, you see? You had to be very persistent to get through medical school, and that took a lot of energy, no question about.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was it awful for you to be so alone? Or did you just make friends and -- and accommodate them that way?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't know, maybe -- I had friends, and I had a very good relation -- see, I been married for 52 years, and I had a very good relation with my wife. And being both doctors [indecipherable] understand the profession and so on. And that, they are very helpful, of course.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But before that, it had to be very difficult for you, to leave as such a young person.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, again -- again, it was just very persistent to get through medicine and specialties and [indecipherable] examination, and so on. There are a lot of exams in medicine, continuously you know, and traveling to -- to get the knowhow, you know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes. You -- but you s -- you did say something, that you thought the war influenced you even to become a doctor.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="60"></span> </p><p> Interview with Harry Iticovici 4 August 24, 2010</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And is that because you've -- well, why -- why -- why di-- why would you say that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>Cause you seem to have wanted to become a doctor for a long time.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't know. I think that maybe the idea was that seeing -- you know, there was another thing also that was when I was the -- as I say, when I went the -- to Paris, you know, waiting to come to this country, there were a lot of refugee camps in Europe, you know. And a friend of mine, a dentist who was -- his family was in Palestine was going around these camps trying to convince Jewish people in the camps to come to Marseilles, so that they can emigrate to -- to Israel, because by that time, the state was there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And there -- I don't know, there are a lot of bad situations around and I don't know, maybe I had the feeling that being a doctor you can help some people, or you can help to change some of the situation.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm. Did you practice -- when you practiced medicine, did you meet people who called themselves survivors, who went through the war?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You didn't.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: You see, in-- no, most of those people concentrated around the Jewish hospital in New York, you know, like Mount Sinai, Beth Israel --</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="61"></span>  65</p><p> Interview with Harry Iticovici August 24, 2010</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- and -- and later on I had the relation with Beth Israel, but by the time I came to Beth Israel, it was late in th -- it was a kind of a religious situation, it wasn't the -- th-the situation of a war, you see?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right, right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But the one thing which -- which remains, and this has been said before by other people, now that this Nazi Germany produced a tremendous amount of shifting of people and population all around Europe, a tremendous amount of damage, you know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: We do have to change the tapes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> End of Tape Four</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="62"></span>  66 Interview with Harry Iticovici August 24, 2010 Beginning Tape Five</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Harry, did -- did you think of working in the DP camps at all when you -- when you went --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You didn't, when you came to Europe --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- when you went to Paris, you didn't?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No. This friend of mine, the dentist, he went to some of those camps, and -- trying to bring people to --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: To Israel, yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- go to Israel, right. Yeah, but I didn't --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But s -- so you didn't even think of whether you could work, even with the minimal amount of knowledge that you had as a two years doctors -- medical student?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You didn't.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You see, this is th -- is another thing that, probably now that you ask those question, I think that one of the reason I was persistent to get a medical degree in th -- work as a doctor, was to give some stability, internal stability that you were somebody that has a purpose, and so on, instead of floating. Now, there were a lot of young men floating  <span class="page-break" number="63"></span> </p><p> Interview with Harry Iticovici *" August 24, 2010 around Paris and floating around Israel in those days, you see? And being a doctor and having a definite profession, it gives you ce -- a certain amount of inner stability, I think.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And this was clearly a big concern for you, that you have something that was yours.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And something that this was, and something that you can concentrate on, and get some results.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right, right. So was -- was the profession of being a doctor very satisfying for you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It was.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. I --1---in spite of all this talk you know, with Obamacare, you know, all this talk about medicine and so on, I said well, I mean, if I had to do it again, I'll do it again.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When -- when did you retire from medicine?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: After the Katrina. Well, let me -- you see, after the Katrina, they closed the -- I used to work in a clinic in Charity Hospital for many years, you know. I worked in the clinic and you see, I had the two appointments. I had -- I was clinical associate professor in surgery at Tulane Medical School. I'm still there, I'm emeritus now. And I had, at the same time, a position in the cli -- different clinics in Charity Hospital, because that's where I go -- I was getting paid to, you see?

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Wow.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [indecipherable] I was teaching surgery for a time -- for a time. Then I worked in a walk-in clinic, then I worked in an anesthesia clinic. Last thing in the 2005, I was in anesthesia clinic.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: That's a very long [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And then they wrote a letter saying that the hospital is going to close, and if -- it-- my situation, after all these years, that I can retire, so I retire. Most of us who worked in that situation retired.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did that make you feel terrible that you didn't -- you didn't want to retire, or did -- were you glad to finally be free in some way?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And then the second hit was Katrina, you see? And I had the impression in my age that I have to -- to wait for a long time in New Orleans to change the situation. So then I decided I'm just going to come here, you see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: To Washington.</p></p></dialogue>
