<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Is there anything else you wanted to talk about that we haven't covered. Anything that you might --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I might. I don't know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>Carol: There's one thing. It's not important but it seems that there are certain people who were better liked than other people. I mean not that there was anything unlikeable about these other people. But maybe they thought they would have a better chance at surviving. And Marc was very weak and so he was in this, what they called a hospital. But it wasn't and there was no medicine or care. But this Dr. Rusa was in charge and he called Marc and told him to please come in and he would help take care of him. And so then he came to Marc. I don't know how many days later, a few days later maybe, and said Marc get ready to leave because the guards are going to come and make a selection.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: That was in camp.</p><p>Carol: Yes, that's right that was in camp and so they quickly hustled Marc out of there and then of course the guards picked out whoever they wanted.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: That was in Golleschau.</p><p>Carol: That helped Marc to survive, to have friends.

Did they build, was a ghetto built in your town? When the Germans came in.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No, there was no ghetto. Ok.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No you know but most people lived in our house because they put in families in addition to our own families. We only had three rooms and they put in neighbors because they took the, they take for themselves.</p><p>Carol: And by the way Schindler's list and sometimes there might, probably are other movies which touched on the Holocaust. That you saw the prisoners eating. Now Marc says that nobody sat down. They weren't allowed to sit down while they ate. They all had to stand around and eat.</p><p>But that just goes to show the inhumanity of these people. They were sadist. They were very sadistic. They were pathological murderers and criminals. They were sociopaths and psychopaths. And this is the existence they had to live among. These crazy hateful people.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Lhad, Jewish people, very nice people that were my friends. All the nice people were friends.</p><p>Carol: But as a matter of fact, an interesting also an interesting situation is especially during the war when we were married at the end of the 50s, we didn't know whether to buy German products or not. A lot of Jews were not doing it. In fact I even came across someone recently who won't buy at Trader Joe. I don't' know if you have a Trader Joe in your neighborhood. They will not buy a British, German goods and so Marc said that well the state of Israel buys its buses and trucks and a lot of their Volkswagens from Germany so not that he was suggesting that we</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="42"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> Interview with Marc Samuels 44 July 25, 2014 not buy from Germany. But it seems to be that that phase is over now. And Germany is one of Israel's good friends. They don't have very many friends in Europe any more, or even in China.</p><p>There is a lot of anti-Semitism. And so --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I get that sub -- Carol: Yes, Marc said that Germany didn't suffer enough. The Germans didn't suffer enough.</p><p>And they didn't. They just walked home after the war. Only a few of them were hung at the Eichmann trial and a few other places. But they didn't suffer enough.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Of course you know they all committed suicide.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell me the names of your children and grandchildren.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>Carol: You want to tell her.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You have better -- Carol: Ok our oldest son's name is Steven. I know this is a Christian name which is a popular name among Jews because there are so many Shmuels around and so we, since our last name was Samuels, and Marc wanted to call him Samuel, Samuels. That's what his name would have been. I said nothing doing. He said I hate you when he gets older for naming him Samuel Samuels, although it strangely enough Marc was, my son Steve was helping out, he was an assistant to a librarian at Brandeis and he came across the name Samuel Samuels. Then he came across the middle initial S in the middle. Samuel S Samuels. And then eventually he found out that the guy's name was Samuel, Samuel, Samuels. That doesn't even sound possible but he wasn't joking either. But I refused to name him Samuel with the last name of Samuels. So we called him Steven for that reason.</p><p>And then Steven. Jonas which was the brother who was killed in Auschwitz, who gave him this crust of bread, gave Marc this crust of bread and then was killed. And then, oh yes he was</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="43"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> Interview with Marc Samuels 45 July 25, 2014 beaten up and they took his boots away. I don't know if Marc mentioned that to you. Took his boots away and then they beat him up. And then he was gassed or whatever they do.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: This was a friend of Marc's.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>Carol: No this is Marc's brother.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh Marc's brother. No he didn't say that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>Carol: Yes. Steve's middle name is Jonas or Yona after his brother.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He was murdered in Auschwitz.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And your other children's names.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>Carol: Oh yes, oh that's right. So that Steven Jonas Samuels. And Jonathan Gabriel Samuels.</p><p>Gabriel was my grandfather's name. Jonathan sounds like Jonas and so I kind of snuck that in cause you are not supposed to give the same name to your children. So in Johan's time. Then David. I always liked the name David. It's just the ultimate Jewish name. I feel the Jewish, the most meaningful Jewish name I think. So David Michael. Since Jonathan's middle name is Gabriel. I have one angel. I named David, David Michael, the other angel. And then Debby is Marc's, Marc's mother. Deborah, Devora. So she has the name of Devora. Let's see.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: She's a professor in the college, in Wheelock college here.</p><p>Carol: Yes, Wheelock College. She just came back from Italy and she was also in Munich teaching the Holocaust. This is her second trip in the course at Wheelock College. It was highly interesting and she got a lot of students to go with her.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Have you worked?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> <span class="page-break" number="44"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> Interview with Marc Samuels 46 July 25, 2014 Carol: I personally. No because I was filled with kids and also there were a lot of synagogue things I had to go to. All the bar mitzvahs and the Hadassah and the Sisterhood, and the Sisterhood board, the Hadassah board. And this goes on and on. People who invite you which is very nice but enough is enough. So I didn't, but I did go to school at night. I didn't go to, I didn't graduate college because my parents just didn't have the money. My father was divorced and their parents were divorced so they had their separate families. So it took me about ten years or more, 12 years to get my bachelor's degree at the University of Pittsburgh when we were in Washington, Pennsylvania. And then we moved and so we were in the Springfield area. And I went to the University of Massachusetts and I finished my degree.</p><p>Oh yes, I got a degree from the University of Pittsburgh in English and I got a master of arts in teaching at the University of Massachusetts which is now a very good state school. And then I had nothing to do when we went to Connecticut. Willimantic Connecticut, Emanuel center. So I got another degree, a bachelor of fine arts this time in graphic design. So I've kept myself busy at night but not to get too involved with his work.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Is there anything else, a message to your grandchildren, Marc, that you would like to give or anything else you wanted to say before we close?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Grandchildren, they're very young now.</p><p>Carol: Nobody is really interested in becoming a rabbi and not only that but we're very disappointed that they don't even take books out of this very large library. Marc donate more than 1500 books to the University of Connecticut, where he taught by the way and we still have over about 1600 books left right now in our very small apartment. So we really don't know what to do about that. So we have one of the largest book collections that any Judaica library has.</p><p>And it's called the Rabbi Marc E. Samuels Judaica collection. Yes. So they're not interested for some reason. Of course they're very young now. But they probably will be interested later on but we still don't know what to do with them. We moved into assisted living.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="45"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Marc Samuels 47 July 25, 2014</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well thank you very much for doing this interview and I just have a few closing words I wanted to say. And so if you could just wait one moment, unless there's something else you wanted to add. Is there anything else you wanted to add or do you feel you've said -- Carol: Yes, about Germany today. Years ago Marc mentioned the fact that the Germans of today are not necessarily the way they were or not the same country as it was. And that you can't blame Germany, German people today at least most of them. There's always anti-Semites around. That you can't get mad at them. They had nothing to do with it. But the fact that they are supportive of Israel is a very good, it's a good sign. Now they're pretty sick and tired of the Bittegoodmachen [ph] | think it's called giving all this money away as a pension.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you get money from Germany?</p></p></dialogue>

And --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: How do you feel about that?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No. [, they took money from me. I came to Washington with some money put into my body, hidden and then they took it everything. Now -- Carol: They took his father gave each child money. I don't know how much it was, like about $200 or something like that.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I don't know.</p><p>Carol: And --  <span class="page-break" number="46"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Marc Samuels 48 July 25, 2014</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I got 500 -- Carol: Like it was folded up and put into their behind, in their rectum and that's how they hid it and for the girls they gave extra money. But when they got to the camps there was no way that they could hide it anymore. And it was useless anyway. You couldn't buy your way out. They'd lull you anyway, after taking the money.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I want to mention one, one thing more. It's not about me but I was present, eyewitness to it.</p><p>There was a family. He went to the Geresh Tebel [ph] here. He was an Orthodox person and he and - Carol: Did you lose your train of thought?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, yes.
