You can read about it because it was too difficult for him to face. And this is why he didn't write any books about his experience. And that's why we're so glad to be able to talk to you or somebody so that some of his, some of their understanding can rub off and they" ll be a little more knowledgeable.</p></p></dialogue>

The children when they graduated from high school they got into Brandeis and one son went to the University of Connecticut. So when they were at Brandeis they made friends of course and they, that was where they settled and they just felt at home and why else would they go somewhere else. They felt. And then why else would where'd we go. So we settled in Brookline also for the same reason. Cause we have four grandchildren now. And so it doesn't make sense to go off to California or something.</p></p></dialogue>

And it's strange by coincidence this fellow became a Sondercommander at Auschwitz. I think he was in charge of putting dead bodies into the crematorium. And this is a fellow that Marc temporarily went to school with. But eventually he was murdered and then also he wrote a lot of information. I don't know if it's a lot of information. But he wrote information and hid it around the concentration camp. So he must have left a little bit of a legacy but it can be seen and there's a mention of this Zalman Leventhal in the Auschwitz album. I don't know if you know about that. It's a book. So there's a mention of Zalman so it was a coincidence. He lived in the same house as Marc in the</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And I had another thing to say, to write about him. He's the one who convinced me to go to yeshiva and of the garon, you know what garon is.</p></p></dialogue>

They took me in and one of the people there came over to me.</p><p>And can you please do me a favor. I said, what, of course rabbi. I need ink to write. I says P'll go out and get ink. And then I got homesick. I went home. I left and a few months after that lahonum vashenem was killed. And then that's another story.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p>Carol: There's one thing. It's not important but it seems that there are certain people who were better liked than other people. I mean not that there was anything unlikeable about these other people. But maybe they thought they would have a better chance at surviving. And Marc was very weak and so he was in this, what they called a hospital. But it wasn't and there was no medicine or care. But this Dr. Rusa was in charge and he called Marc and told him to please come in and he would help take care of him. And so then he came to Marc. I don't know how many days later, a few days later maybe, and said Marc get ready to leave because the guards are going to come and make a selection.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: That was in camp.</p><p>Carol: Yes, that's right that was in camp and so they quickly hustled Marc out of there and then of course the guards picked out whoever they wanted.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: That was in Golleschau.</p><p>Carol: That helped Marc to survive, to have friends.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No you know but most people lived in our house because they put in families in addition to our own families. We only had three rooms and they put in neighbors because they took the, they take for themselves.</p><p>Carol: And by the way Schindler's list and sometimes there might, probably are other movies which touched on the Holocaust. That you saw the prisoners eating. Now Marc says that nobody sat down. They weren't allowed to sit down while they ate. They all had to stand around and eat.</p><p>But that just goes to show the inhumanity of these people. They were sadist. They were very sadistic. They were pathological murderers and criminals.

A lot of Jews were not doing it. In fact I even came across someone recently who won't buy at Trader Joe. I don't' know if you have a Trader Joe in your neighborhood. They will not buy a British, German goods and so Marc said that well the state of Israel buys its buses and trucks and a lot of their Volkswagens from Germany so not that he was suggesting that we</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And so --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I get that sub -- Carol: Yes, Marc said that Germany didn't suffer enough. The Germans didn't suffer enough.</p><p>And they didn't.

I know this is a Christian name which is a popular name among Jews because there are so many Shmuels around and so we, since our last name was Samuels, and Marc wanted to call him Samuel, Samuels. That's what his name would have been. I said nothing doing. He said I hate you when he gets older for naming him Samuel Samuels, although it strangely enough Marc was, my son Steve was helping out, he was an assistant to a librarian at Brandeis and he came across the name Samuel Samuels. Then he came across the middle initial S in the middle. Samuel S Samuels. And then eventually he found out that the guy's name was Samuel, Samuel, Samuels. That doesn't even sound possible but he wasn't joking either. But I refused to name him Samuel with the last name of Samuels. So we called him Steven for that reason.</p><p>And then Steven. Jonas which was the brother who was killed in Auschwitz, who gave him this crust of bread, gave Marc this crust of bread and then was killed.

<dialogue class=""><p>Carol: Oh yes, oh that's right. So that Steven Jonas Samuels. And Jonathan Gabriel Samuels.</p><p>Gabriel was my grandfather's name. Jonathan sounds like Jonas and so I kind of snuck that in cause you are not supposed to give the same name to your children. So in Johan's time. Then David. I always liked the name David. It's just the ultimate Jewish name. I feel the Jewish, the most meaningful Jewish name I think. So David Michael. Since Jonathan's middle name is Gabriel. I have one angel. I named David, David Michael, the other angel. And then Debby is Marc's, Marc's mother. Deborah, Devora. So she has the name of Devora.

No because I was filled with kids and also there were a lot of synagogue things I had to go to. All the bar mitzvahs and the Hadassah and the Sisterhood, and the Sisterhood board, the Hadassah board. And this goes on and on. People who invite you which is very nice but enough is enough. So I didn't, but I did go to school at night. I didn't go to, I didn't graduate college because my parents just didn't have the money. My father was divorced and their parents were divorced so they had their separate families. So it took me about ten years or more, 12 years to get my bachelor's degree at the University of Pittsburgh when we were in Washington, Pennsylvania. And then we moved and so we were in the Springfield area. And I went to the University of Massachusetts and I finished my degree.</p><p>Oh yes, I got a degree from the University of Pittsburgh in English and I got a master of arts in teaching at the University of Massachusetts which is now a very good state school. And then I had nothing to do when we went to Connecticut. Willimantic Connecticut, Emanuel center. So I got another degree, a bachelor of fine arts this time in graphic design. So I've kept myself busy at night but not to get too involved with his work.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Grandchildren, they're very young now.</p><p>Carol: Nobody is really interested in becoming a rabbi and not only that but we're very disappointed that they don't even take books out of this very large library. Marc donate more than 1500 books to the University of Connecticut, where he taught by the way and we still have over about 1600 books left right now in our very small apartment. So we really don't know what to do about that. So we have one of the largest book collections that any Judaica library has.</p><p>And it's called the Rabbi Marc E. Samuels Judaica collection. Yes. So they're not interested for some reason. Of course they're very young now. But they probably will be interested later on but we still don't know what to do with them. We moved into assisted living.</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And so if you could just wait one moment, unless there's something else you wanted to add. Is there anything else you wanted to add or do you feel you've said -- Carol: Yes, about Germany today. Years ago Marc mentioned the fact that the Germans of today are not necessarily the way they were or not the same country as it was. And that you can't blame Germany, German people today at least most of them. There's always anti-Semites around. That you can't get mad at them. They had nothing to do with it. But the fact that they are supportive of Israel is a very good, it's a good sign. Now they're pretty sick and tired of the Bittegoodmachen [ph] | think it's called giving all this money away as a pension.</p></p></dialogue>
