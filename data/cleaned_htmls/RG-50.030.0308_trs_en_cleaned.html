Did you have brothers and sisters?</p><p>A. I had three sisters and one brother.</p><p>Q. Were you active before the war, were you involved with any political authorities?</p><p>A. I was in a radical party which means the party. So, my father was there and I was in the so called organization. After World War IL, during the World War IL, the personal police in the states he didn't belong to any party. That was the military you couldn't be in any party.</p><p>Q. What point was this now?</p><p>A. It was from "38 to "42.</p><p>Q. Why were you all involved with this party?</p><p>A. We had a so called democratic party. It was mostly creation and so socialists and other combinations and we were -- Q. What did that mean?</p><p>A. It means royal, monarchy, a king. It was at that time Alexander II. They killed him in Marseilles in "34, and Hitler against him in the organization they killed all the people they didn't like because at that time during the Hitler, after "33, it was a so called small , it was Yugoslavia, Poland, Rumania, Greece, Czechoslovakia against Hitler, the organization so called smaller . King Alexander was the organizer. So, to explain this thing, the German organized some terrorist group terrorist <span class="page-break" number="0"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> and they killed the king in Paris. He was going to meet in Paris. It was some conference about this political situation or something against Nazis.</p><p>Q.

But there probably were different attitudes among the people from Croatia?</p><p>A. The Cratons most of all, they come to the Yugoslavians after World War I. They betrayed Austria, they betrayed Yugoslavia too. They went to Yugoslavia to avoid the calamity in Austria. But they were good friends. The the Slovanians and the Cratons all was with Austria. It was Austrian educated. . Part of was <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> Q. Was this a very organized movement?</p><p>A. Yes, in the beginning it was organized. We had good contact with the British and they were supporting but not regularly. So we had to -- we was left with the Yugoslavian arms and that stuff. When Hitler came to Yugoslavia the communists were good friends so they had contact with Hitler. The communists told us that Hitler was going to show how to build socialism, so we should join Hitler. When Hitler then came in "41 later on before he went against the Soviet Union, when he hanged a couple of them in they then start to run to organize the communist movement. We had not much communist so it was when Hitler marched in. Criminals somehow were released or escaped. He ordered them back to prison they wanted to join the so mostly the criminals were mostly communist. The communists said they were not criminals, society was responsible for their behavior. They started to fight us, to fight Germans, they fight us so you had to pass many " Q. So there was never any coordination between the army and the communists in fighting the common enemy which was Germany.</p><p>Q. At first there was but these two guys over there in this so called SOE, this like our OSS, they ordered the to get a commander from</p><p> . The said they would fight but political they won't have nothing to do with it. So, they started really fighting with the communists and the . <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> A. In the country mostly. In the city it was difficult because the Germans were in the city under control.</p><p>Q. How secretive was it?</p><p>A. If more than two people know it's tough, it's no more secret. It is the procedure, but any way we tried to avoid any invitation but we couldn't avoid many communists that infiltrated this group, all the gestapo.</p><p>Q. What were your responsibilities?</p><p>A. I was to organize the youth in the group and the military units and I was liaison to the Italians. That was my duties.</p><p>Q. Whey you say you organized the youth, what did that mean? What did you do?</p><p>A. The nationalists, the country, I mean the Yugoslavs mostly to protect, to be ready when necessary to fight the Germans, the communists.</p><p>Q. Tell me more, tell me details how you spent your time?</p><p>A. I was mostly traveling from group to group. I also had a many Germans <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> Q. How did you get arrested, tell me about that?</p><p>A. I was coming from Italy and I had a friend, I forgot his , he was by the</p><p> , regular army. He was somehow given that information and he hate Hitler.</p><p>So, his daughter was girlfriend for gestapo men and she betrayed them. So, she told them</p><p> . So, since he was a German citizen there was executed. I</p><p> was sent back to gestapo for investigation. So the Germans then gave me to the Italians,</p><p> whatever you call it, and one of them should bring me to . So, we went to a cafeteria in Italy and there were a couple girls. He didn't know why I was arrested.</p><p>He tried to table and I didn't know what he wants. The girls tried to tease him to let the gun and I run to the kitchen and escape but anyway I was later on arrested. This was one month. So, I come to the gestapo.</p><p>Q. So what did you do when you escaped?</p><p>A. I tried to come back to Yugoslavia and one month later they were looking for me. The gestapo found me. I tried to somehow avoid but it didn't work. So, I was then sentenced to death, death penalty. Later on my father is friends to the Yugoslavian police and the commander was the , he was somehow sympathetic to the marxists, he did not like Hitler.</p><p>It was "43 he committed suicide when he was called to Berlin. So, he sent me to Dachau, illegal.</p><p>I was sentenced in the books for the gestapo I was executed, but he sent me to a concentration camp so I had that penalty. But I was mad because that penalty was better than the concentration camp.</p><p>Q. Now, I don't want to stop you but I have a question. What was life like in Yugoslavia in this period in Belgrade under the Germans? What was happening? I'm just trying to get a sense --?</p><p>A. you have to follow the laws and any sabotage any stuff they took from the city where it was endangered, they took hostage. If the place was under Germans, they took from each soldier ten, each civilian for each officer a hundred so that was the procedure. If you in some kind of occupation, so order justice is to shut up. The second <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> one there was many an order that was arrested for reading some stuff on British or it was I mean the gestapo was working very good, very precise. <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> A. Not much frightened -- you were frightened rather from the communist, the situation, but the Germans never took time to go to the country. They were watching the main routes to Greece to down there but you did not see them too much in the country.</p><p>Q. When you were involved with the resistance, were you personally aware of acts of sabotage?</p><p>A. Yes, we did not kill them but we stopped the British, stop the trains.</p><p> , and stuff. <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0 hands up. Nobody find anything. You couldn't buy everything for the Italian soldier, wine and so on, arms and stuff. It was not so.</p><p>Q. What other specific acts did you do for the resistance?</p><p>A, . We first organized and took on the people to save them to <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 1 A. If you walk through there you can be attacked by the communists. You have to live like arabbit. To watch everything. It was, you get used to it and it's no big deal. You're young and you know what you want. You have to take precautions.</p><p>Q. What kind of precautions?</p><p>A. Precautions not to make mistake. You can't talk to -- we had special code words to talk like usually the organization is to talk, -- you can't talk to family or anybody.</p><p>Q. Did you see your family during this time?</p><p>A. Not much.</p><p>Q. Were you ever, other than that one time, were you ever caught or close to being caught?</p><p>A. Sometimes yes, I don't know what happened but the Germans went and blocked all the city and then everybody tried to get the military barracks and sometime some seems to me that they try us through the window, by passing the windows of the building. Then somebody with newspapers with holes, somebody was watching us but maybe I was lucky enough to be recognized or you get in trouble. For example, in Vienna, the gestapo didn't read the paper, and the guy sent me to the gestapo building. I went over there and I read this direction and I went out and didn't say anything.</p><p>Q. Were you afraid?</p><p>A. What can you be afraid? There is not much fear. If you are afraid you cannot think. You cannot be afraid. If you are afraid you stay home. That is the rule. You don't do it if you are afraid. Fear cannot be mixed with what you're doing. Somehow in split second you get, but you try to overcome and to survey the situation to take proper handling. Stuff you have to do.</p><p>Q. Did you ever have contact with the communists?</p><p>A. No, we'd kill each other, but I didn't have.</p><p>Q. I've done some reading and that's why I want to ask you this. Is my sense that the communists and the resistance army had different methods and had different goals?</p><p>A. Yes. We had two and the one I think was the rank. One was <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 2 the tales of the Soviet Union and everything and they tried to do much as possible in killing the German soldiers to force the people to join them to create terror. For them there was something bigger so and so on and from the communists army this was terrible. They were worse than the Germans in many places. They were robbing from the people and take everything, money and food. The people mostly were afraid from the communists more than from the Germans in many places.</p><p>Q. Now, you figured out that it would be better to go to Dachau than to stay in prison?</p><p>A. Stay in prison, the penalty to be executed is better than to go to Dachau.</p><p>Q. So, what happened. Tell me about your going to Dachau?</p><p>A. Nothing. You were transported over there. You come before camp, you come to this quarantined barracks, blocks. And then after a couple weeks or 40 days you get registered. No, before you come there, you are staying in the snow and the rain and they give you the number.</p><p>The transports bring in the and they establish the carts and then after this you go and are distributed to the blocks. In Dachau there were mostly after professionals and so, distribution. I come to an Austrian guy , in block 16 and from that I was working with a Slovanian couple. We went to the , to the train on the railroad station. The couple was -- it was not -- with a black train. They were stealing the civilian -- as you go to work outside the camp in Mauthassen, in Dachau they give you civilian red paint and then later on I was working potato cell to peel the potatoes to sort them and to peel them. The guards, it was mostly this from Poland. They called a lot of Pollocks, the Germans, they so called where you put the core and you could fry the potato <span class="page-break" number="11"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 3 Q. Okay, let's talk a little more about Dachau? You were there for how long? What were the dates?</p><p>A. Almost one year.</p><p>Q. Do you remember the dates?</p><p>A. Icame on November 5 in Dachau, 1942.</p><p>Q. And you left?</p><p>A. I left in October, end of October on a transport to Mauthaussen.</p><p>Q. In "43?</p><p>A. In "43, yes. I come also in November of "43, I don't remember the dates, to Mauthaussen.</p><p>It was a terrible transport. We went from Dachau to Czechoslovakia. on the <span class="page-break" number="12"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 4 Q. These were German criminal prisoners?</p><p>A. Yes, as a political prisoner you could not get any position if you wanted. It was mostly criminal.</p><p>Q. Were there Jewish prisoners there?</p><p>A. In Dachau there was only one small guy that was cleaning the shoes for the SS. I don't know what happened to him later. First time Jews in Mauthaussen, Jews come 2,000 some. It was the last transport for the Jews and then in "45 they come from Auschwitz. As a Jew in Dachau and communist you could not survive. As a Jew or communist in Dachau they send you to Auschwitz or kill you there.</p><p>Q. While you were there, this happened?</p><p>A. Oh, yes. It was maybe some in the in the country, the role call -- <span class="page-break" number="13"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 5 A. No. The criminal were brought only for the management in the camp, for the kapos, or block . The barrack was mostly Czechs that spoke German very well. Then it was criminal from the the main office . This means they're for <span class="page-break" number="13"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 6</p><p> Tape 2 Q. We were talking about the different kinds of prisoners at Dachau and I'm wondering were you separated according to your type or did you work with people with different classifications.</p><p>A. With people who were French, I mean nobody your number and your name put you in the working group and you went to work.</p><p>Q. Did the political prisoners work with the POWs?</p><p>A. No. The POW was a different kind. It wasn't Geneva Convention, they were entitled to work but different procedure.</p><p>Q. Were some prisoners treated better than other prisoners?</p><p>A. I don't think so. I did not see. Maybe the homosexuals were treated better but the normal people, everybody the same.</p><p>Q. Did you come in contact with a lot of the homosexual prisoners?</p><p>A. No. It was not like it in the camp so they were isolated. They had all the good positions too. They were mostly musicians and stuff like this.</p><p>Q. Do you think the political prisoners were treated better than some of the other people?</p><p>A. No, this was wars. It was not different, we were all political except the camp personnel.</p><p>It was from the instructions of the political department or gestapo. Many of them they get to go to the city. That was also different. In Germany I think the sentence required more than five years imprisonment they were executed, the death penalty it was. It was mostly, my kapo was a guy that stole a parcel in the post office. He was upstairs so that this should happening it means the end of the war. They were after the war to serve.</p><p>Q. Now, I remember reading that when you went to Dachau you were a clerk, in the administration?</p><p>A. No. I was not aclerk. A guy , he was original in camp, a clerk and he <span class="page-break" number="14"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 7 you are an employee. He changed my card. He saved my life. He was later on in the , of Czechoslovakian decent. He saved my life. I was never in the office.</p><p>Q. What was an average day like?</p><p>A. You'd have to get up at 5:00 to wash, to get the coffee, not really coffee. It was from grain. If you are fast you get warm, if you're slow you get cold. That was morning. You had to go to roll call to get counted. Then, group formation. If you are attached to a working commander you have to join your kapo and then walk out. If you are not attached, they put you there and write your number and you work and you work until 6:00, 7:00, it depends, and then come back. We'd march, . That was -- we had in Dachau Sunday was off and everybody was sitting somewhere preparing their stuff. You get wood down and in two weeks they were gone. , that was the daily life. <span class="page-break" number="15"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 8 was terrible. For example, if you are the last and somebody fell down, you pick up the people in the front took care of him. They kill them on the way because they're hit and they didn't want to carry them because sometime you are weak too. They kill him before they brought them in the camp, so it was terrible. You see it was not too many relations because everybody wanted to save himself. Like says . It was not human. You <span class="page-break" number="16"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 9 and never exceed. I think it was before the SS decided to put the regime to work in the war industry and they took the ability in Austria, the industry facility, needed prisoners. The SS used them before they destroyed them. Dachau was only to work for the needs of the camp, industry stuff. We had to plant our own vegetables and take care of all the cleaning and stuff.</p><p>Mauthaussen was the center. 80,000 prisoners came to Mauthaussen under different branches.</p><p>Going to Mauthaussen was a different story. Mauthaussen was discipline too, so you get your food but you didn't stay long in Mauthaussen. I came in November I think. I was already in Christmas transport to . That was the camp, the camp and four barracks. It was a small one. The guy, the , the SS man was announced all officers and all dignity and he did it with order. The kapos couldn't bother you in camp. Outside okay, but gave us order. It came, I was surprised it was Christmas. He ordered the kitchen to give tea with rum.</p><p>I fainted, almost, you are weak. It was dumb. Then he distributed the cigarettes himself. Not</p><p> , not nobody. So, it was somehow human. We had good music, good theater.</p><p>One guy came and said in Germany the potatoes are good, but in Dachau they</p><p> . Music was okay. He come with his daughter to listen to the bands. It was somehow, the SS kitchen was the same in camp. So, I met friends, I went to high school and such, Joseph. I didn't know it was German, but a German office and he was afraid when he saw me. He said don't talk, and later on he saw me and said I cannot talk but I can inform your parents that you are here. So, when he went to eat the lunch he went to my barrack, went to my bed, asked me where I sleep and left his food. I didn't see him anymore.</p><p>Q. How long were you in Mauthaussen, the main camp?</p><p>A. Mauthaussen, not long, one month two months, not long. They didn't keep you. You get the number and there were three or four central camps. Buchenwald, Dachau, Mauthaussen and Auschwitz and Birkenau, where you get the number. So, when you get to Mauthaussen and get the number, they send you then -- in Mauthaussen it was 16, it was one, two and three, and then industry, steel industry. Then it was . It was many camps then. Upstairs it was camp B. It was <span class="page-break" number="17"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0 mostly officers for the construction below. But, the records they start to : <span class="page-break" number="17"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 1 the and it was not bad. It was September or end of August we went to the garden to the vegetables, we were so stuffed we were eating. At 4:00 in the morning you go down there to the railroads to load four or five wagons and then to travel to and was the distribution direct to the railroad, that was the second train. On the way there was bombing. We couldn't' sleep in the car. We were standing somewhere in the station before the alarm was over, two hours, three hours.</p><p>From there it's already 11 hours and we were in the command and was mostly shuffled, work.</p><p>After this, it was September until the snow start up. I don't know how I escaped this. I went to work mostly in the there was a French doctor, a nice guy and he let me ride sick where I was to go and then I came back to work in . Iwas not in good shape and the small tracks, the small machines, all the steam machines and soon them come to load the cement or sand on this. When they go back after ten minutes comes the second one or so. What we did is we opened this stuff and put find sand in to damage the cylinder and when the steam goes not too much power. They had to repair. Sometimes we were lucky not to get the steam to work. It was already "45. Maybe one week before we get the locals to work and then again we did stuff. Then maybe they find out and there was SS in prisoner overcoat and I was about to unscrew one of them from one side they came to me. I didn't know he was SS, he asked me in Polish because he is Yugoslav. He asked , sol told him in Polish . He looked at me you dogs and then took me to <span class="page-break" number="18"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 2 I'm sure. I could not go. When you stand, you fall down. I was 38 kilograms, when the Americans came. It was in "44 I think the Hungarians Jews come and it was a couple thousand and then all the kapos, all the they were chasing them to work from four to eleven at night and they were not allowed to see doctors or anything. The men died.</p><p>Q. So they were treated much differently?</p><p>A. Oh, yes, it was inhuman what they did to them. It was mostly people fresh from the</p><p> , to be beaten, but I saw very few SS people. There was one they called him . There was a blonde SS who was killing and than a couple of them I forgot his name. It was mostly the criminals, the German criminals that were doing the job. It was terrible. Also, the so called clerk in the camp was Luxembourg, Alfred Shockfield, something like that. He was the one that organized the whole stealing and there was a second one who bartered. It was also shortly before the Americans come and organized and they called it , you get from somewhere not to protect the provisions but protect <span class="page-break" number="19"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 3 was already sent to work. You could not stay in the camp. They don't care if you're sick. You have to go to fulfill that amount of prisoners, but the company was protesting because you cannot, if they send you over there, you cannot move. I remember the short "45, "44 so they did not have enough guard the so called , the last hope. The blue uniforms, not SS, they had two -- we had to carry people. They were watching the before America comes. . Two days before the Americans come they <span class="page-break" number="20"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 4 as soon as they talk about this. But a couple days later, the gestapo the commander from Mauthaussen he was commander for all the 70,000 or 80,000, he come and he took them away, took the pistol and everything. We got the means, .

I could not work. I couldn't do anything. There was prisoners looking for the SS people. They were already long gone. There was in the population. I cannot imagine the hasidic didn't know what was going on upstairs. The Americans brought to demonstrate but the American did not give us food for one day because one general was killed.</p><p>Q. The Americans punished you?</p><p>A. Punished us all time they didn't give us to eat because you cannot let this stuff to justice.</p><p>So, mostly Russians they were, but at that time mostly they were robbing the population there some guy took the sauerkraut and he was dead. They did this stuff. It was in this cell or tent there was hospital and the American nurse let me box of milk chocolates. I could not eat.</p><p>I tried but it was so -- I give it to next to me was a Polish guy . He at it all. He ate all of it and two days later he was dead. A young fellow. He died.</p><p>Q. Can you think of anything that you did in these camps out of desperation that you can't even imagine you've done?</p><p>A. No, you cannot think. You are like under hypnosis. You have no proper thinking because you just count today how long you'll stay alive. There was no political or philosophical thought. You are not normal. It is impossible to do anything because I cannot walk ten feet or twenty feet and not fall down. I had to sleep on the third floor because if you sleep down there on first floor on the second there was a Polish or Czech guy so called</p><p> he'd kill you to get your food.

I don't know what they did, but there were Yugoslav doctor. Doctor was working but I didn't talk. He said stay away. Many people who get good condition they were commanded by the kapo to work in the crematorium and after two months all the people working there were dead so they can't tell what is going on. It was not far, the next city to me so sometime he talked to me. He did not tell what they were doing.</p><p>Q. Did you notice anything in Dachau?</p><p>A. In Dachau I didn't notice anything. There were no such facilities. In Mauthaussen it was already and I think somebody told me it started in Auschwitz too, but not in Dachau.</p><p>Q. But you didn't know anybody who had been treated?</p><p>A. No. I didn't know.</p><p>Q. Were there many suicides?</p><p>A. Not intentionally. Somebody run and get killed by the SS or so. You are weak, there was no way to kill yourself. You come so far and you wait for what happen to you. You are not able to make any decision. The beginning okay, the first time you come over there you think it is best dead and so what is process in time go forward you lose everything, proper feeling proper thinking. You already have written yourself off. At the same time I didn't believe I am still alive.</p><p>Q. Any efforts for people to try to escape?</p><p>A. Oh, yes there were a couple escapes really and I think a couple come through from Dachau.
