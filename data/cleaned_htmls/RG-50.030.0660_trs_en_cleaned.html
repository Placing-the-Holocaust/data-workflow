Okay. <span class="page-break" number="15"></span> ontactrefieannedjustanmiang er hither btemelortabnattfiexaliaton _ A Jewish Lithuanian School.</p><p>Q Lithuanian?</p><p>A And then there was a Cobert (ph) school.</p><p>Q And what about I have heard of Shola Hahim (ph) school?</p><p>A It was the Russians went to our school and gave it the name Shola Ilahim because everything turned into Yiddish. It was forbidden.</p><p>Q Isee. So -- A Serious.</p><p>Q -- so the language of instruction in your school was Hebrew?</p><p>A From the very beginning.</p><p>Q Does that mean can I -- can I interpret from that that your family was very religious?</p><p>A No.</p><p>Q No.</p><p>A How did you come to such a conclusion?</p><p>Q How did I come to such a conclusion because when I hear Hebrew I think of the Bible.</p><p>A No way. <span class="page-break" number="16"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 20 Q And I think of religion.</p><p>A In contrary.

Geta piece of cake or milkshake or whatever and sit with his friends. And I read a selfi (ph) in Elistanova (ph). You know what Stanova (ph) is?</p><p>Stanova is -- there was a Russian word that was used in and among the Lithuanians and I used to lie next to him and he used to tell me little stories. Most of the stories he repeated. I knew it already by heart. But the story, like, for the mitelda (ph) mysitatelga (ph), which means, I'll tell you a story with a white goat, the schetzliata (ph) and mitsushaka (ph). So, this was very good. You could tell it, but I always listen to it and the whole story about the goat and the sheep, the schetzliata sheep. She is red and so there is a fourth little stories. But, Monica stories, and traveling. He didn't go to the summer house. __He used to come only on weekends.</p><p>Q He worked?

And we got a shock and laid in a hospital for a year.</p><p>Q Wow. How old were you?</p><p>A He never -- he never came back. Three and five.Q How old were you when that happened?</p><p>A Ten. It was on the eve of Passover and see then eve of Passover the Russians shut down was a New Year. He always come home, but when such a thing -- today they don't men -- they can't skip. Lithuanians it was a holiday. It wasn't a religious family. It was a religional family. It definitely wasn't a religious.</p><p>The school was not a religious. | They didn't even taught us how to pray. This was anti-religious I would say in away.</p><p>Q Really. Yeah.</p><p>A They wanted a new product, the modern Jew. Another settled Jew. They created the new Jew. This new Jew existed many years. This was when he was very rich and he became babahelshoa (ph) or rothchild or what the feuher (ph) or whatever, but novawent (ph) it was a schetel (ph) and schetel was odo (ph). The schetel was very progressive in away that instead of you following that mystical organization. If I was to go to Lithuania I will buy for you the book that Gustadtz (ph) did.</p><p>Q Okay.</p><p>A When you read the book you understand everything. <span class="page-break" number="23"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 24 Q Okay. I want to ask a few other questions that are before the war and then we come to those -- all those other events. In your family circle and in the people that you knew, did you have any friends who were not Jews? Was your world self-contained?</p><p>Was it a Jewish world or was it one that was mixed?</p><p>A That's a political, yes.</p><p>Q Yes, it is. But it is also a social question. _It is trying to get a sense of how closed were societies? How closed were communities? How open were communities?</p><p>How much did people know about one another?</p><p>A No, no non-Jewish friends.</p><p>Q No non-Jewish friends.</p><p>A It's not only that, the Jews lived in Lithuania, not like in Germany. In Germany, a Jew was not a Jew. He was only believed in the religion of Moses. But mainly he was a German. Wherein Lithuania and Poland, no. Mostly in Lithuania. Lithuania is very classic for it. It is a society -- a Jewish society which doesn't mingle with the unJews. I mean, when the children, of course, the grown-ups used to make business friends. But I didn't have any non-Jewish friends. I had no Jewish friends when we went to Palanga, not Kretinga, Palanga because there were no other Jews. We are the only family, maybe another one. And there it was -- I was -- I played there, but as friends, I cannot recall anybody that I kept on a relationship with him later on. <span class="page-break" number="24"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 25 Another way this happened, it is abnormal in away, but I don't -- I don't know, for example, Jewish children in another kadanzing (ph).

A maid who lived in your family. Was she the only person who was non-Jewish that you interacted with in a regular way? Yes?</p><p>A She was everything to me. She was a maid. She was a nanny, but something happened to her. She became pregnant. And Teresa was born. Her name was Vinsa (ph).</p><p>Q Vinsa.</p><p>A Teresa was born and my mother said -- I mean, the husband was not known. I knew the husband, because they used to sneak in the remainder of the house and I understood there was something going on. Vinsa was very good to us. We loved her, especially my brother. And my father said, take Teresa and go to Pusucamas (ph). You know where Pusucamas? You don't know where that is. Pusucamas is when you right on Scadniop (ph) now you know.</p><p>Q Okay. Yosweneuronos (ph). We'll look at this later. So she had to leave your family?</p><p>A No, she says I cannot go back. _It is illegitimate child. They will tear me to pieces.We are a very strict catholic family. We don't want it. | And my mother felt and my father, let her stay with us. Teresa will grow up together with our children and this is what happened. But the mean children at school used to say how is Teresa today. It was another thing. They came to see Teresa.

Wonderful.</p><p>She was born in Ricoholen (ph), in the Jewish hospital or in the private hospital it is much more money.</p><p>Q Yeah.</p><p>A And this is a tiger I'm telling you.</p><p>Q Yeah.</p><p>A Why, you will understand in a minute. Look, she was to go with us for a walk with us children. | She was very religious. So, you know, the big cathedral in Kaunas on Vilinus Venachos (ph) she used to take us there.

It took -- he is a para trooper and up until 18 he was -- he was pin drop (ph) and the minute he got his matura, he was enlisted and then he went to para trooper for nine months. Terrible. He went to training because the para trooper they are expected to be the Commander.</p><p>Q All right. So Vitas was a Hussar?</p><p>A Vitas was a Hussar. I don't know why I remember. Why do I make acknowledge because I have Vitas is he was like a general.</p><p>Q Yeah.</p><p>A He make me sworn.

I look at that uniform nothing can compare. Okay. But we are not to play with our soldiers, but defending. I'm so happy now when I remember Vitas.</p><p>Q Okay.</p><p>A Yes, but -- but what happened later. Can we go on?</p><p>Q Absolutely if you want to say something please do.</p><p>A No. I mean, she was a second mother. And my little brother she was everything for him. When we were shipped to the Ghetto, she wanted to take him. She says, I'll save his life. It was clear what was going on. And my mother said, no, whatever will be with us will be with him. She took Teresa. She went to the village.</p><p>She crawled through the holes and the ragging and a lot of food and she helped us to going into the Ghetto.</p><p>Q So you are talking now about the time when you -- all the Jews of Kaunas were ordered to go into the Ghetto in the summer of 1941, yeah? <span class="page-break" number="29"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 30 A Iremember there. And that's it. And there is no more Vinsa. No more Teresa. There was a Ghetto. This will talk later, but in "95, "91 when Lithuania became independent, and my brother started to nudge me, I said, Dani, forget about it.</p><p>I'm not going there. I don't want to see it. I don't want to go to Lithuania. _" Forget it. He said, no, no, no, Vinsa is still alive. I want to see her.</p><p>Q Was she?</p><p>A No. Sowe went. We went. We came to Kaunas.

Maybe they meet us. So the guy goes in and says, do you know Uri and Dani Chanoch? They my brothers. They killed everyone. Started to cry. Because Teresa was already attached. She lived only on the memories, on the stories that her mother told her because they don't hold no interest for them. They was in Cohost (ph), the Russians and the times that they stay with the Cohost, this is the golden age. My mother never checked out with money, take money and buy this, buy this. Ladies who checked out how much and then she comes out and she sees us and she started to shout and to cry, are you alive? It was no connection in those times. Only once I sent her an invitation when I marry Judy and she was kept in captivity because Israel was -- Q Enemy country, right.</p><p>A And we have it on the video.</p><p>Q You have it on video.

But I contacted her. We had like family. And I'm also with her two daughters in touch. Teresa and Vinsa came back and Vinsa became the head of the village.</p><p>Q She became the head of the village, that's amazing.</p><p>A Why don't you ask why?</p><p>Q Well, why?</p><p>A Because the Germans needed food. So they went to the kymas (ph).</p><p>Q To the villages, yes.</p><p>A And they confiscated.</p><p>Q Yes.</p><p>A You had five pigs, they took the five pigs, but then they came to visit Kymas, Teresa came over and spoke to them in Yiddish. They understood. They said in Yiddish, don't take all the five pigs. Take two pigs. Leave us all something. She communicated. Nobody could communicate. Nobody spoke Yiddish in Bucykamas (ph), and she was very honored.</p><p>Q In spite of the fact that she had an illegitimate? <span class="page-break" number="32"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 33 A In spite of the fact that it was already the Russian period, the religion was not anymore a dominant factor.I was really -- I was starting the story, I said, look something good came out of it.</p><p>Q Yeah.</p><p>A Vinsa died from cancer five years before.</p><p>Q In 1990, if you went in "95.</p><p>A Yeah, in 1990 she died.

I think, maybe it was Selima (ph) or something like this. They both -- they both died by accident or by cars or by -- I don't know. They were drinking toomuch. This is a sickness there in Lithuania.</p><p>Q Oh, yeah, huge. It is huge.</p><p>A The drinking and I don't know what kind of a living Teresa made, a poor living, but she was happy. When I make you understand because I used to come very often to Lithuania, I tried to, to get some community property back, and there one day I came with one of our ministers and we were sitting next to the opera and the mystic garden. <span class="page-break" number="33"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 34</p><p> Q Oh, yeah.</p><p>A And we were having lunch and she said, I wish Stalin would come back.</p><p>Q Oh, yeah.</p><p>A So at least I had -- I went to Dachau. I had enough to eat. What they did to us today, they gave us, okay, I supported it. It is not.</p><p>Q I know of that sentiment. I have heard it as well.</p><p>A Yes.</p><p>Q Yes.</p><p>A Then it was very shocking. All of this said, look. Life was organized. Okay.

I said you Pontius Pilate and then here we are recohomo (ph) and here first station and the second station and she doesn't react. She doesn't try to include.

If you were to explain to her what the stations of the cross and she hadn't known what it was before.

So something must have changed?</p><p>A There was more because I was asked to go. There is a different story. If you go back to the atrocities -- Q We haven't even gotten there yet.</p><p>A Yeah. It is -- you come back to a place where you were born and you like it.</p><p>The weather was good. It wasn't hot like here or anything, hot sometimes and everything was good. Every morning we used to go with a couple at the inn.</p><p>Q To have some coffee.</p><p>A And butter and the milk and the school and the Dutcha (ph). I mean, it wasn't a big family. We were normal middle class family and every year we went to grandma's and this was the highlight of my life to go to the schitel (ph) and she came to pick us up from the train with the local kutcher (ph), with the local guy that had -- Q A driver who had a carriage? <span class="page-break" number="36"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 37 A Horse carriage and then for a week, the hostel was somehow connected. _It is all dangerous because most of the people love her and I would ask Canuzum (ph) with the father there was a difference. It was fun because -- Q Really.</p><p>A -- because we did the dishes, went together with the Gila (ph) conquer the almost became as far as Turkey and there you saw the Karakash. Karakash are a Jewish sect that believe only what is written with no interpretations. Maybe the other regions in the Bavaria, this was after the expulsion from Spain they went to Turkey. And when people saw the twitter this takes people.</p><p>Q This is medieval history.</p><p>A The situation could only improve. So they came, another couple of hundred people and followed the Karakash. So, therefore, in this schitel I have a Sephardic name, Sephardic name. It is Enoch, not asa firstname. Enoch is the grandson of Adam and Eve. The son of Cain, which is not a big thing. I think all of them, but -- but then you find German and you find durmichaven (ph) and donmeh, a lot of donmeh, which is a lot of selanikli not covered, not covered lot of. So, of course, Bita (ph) that came over Exkalzaday (ph). The schitel was, but my sister didn't go. Her mother didn't let her.

So why -- but my little daughter says one that was here, she works in York and she -- I love my grandma. Please, she has the name Gaila (ph) give her all my grandmother's name, Sara-Leah. So, you know, that everybody goes to the admils (ph) the girls. This is compulsive. You have to. So she sits there at the crematorium camp and they call it Auschwitz, you know, and they said that -- then they said Trina, Gallia, Sara-Leah, both of them, two girls knew that's three girls actually.</p><p>This is a joke.</p><p>Q Okay.

They went from house to house. So, I don't know. Where are my parents? Where is my sister? Where is my little brother? Where is Vincent (ph), where is Teraza (ph)? I will tell you something. Vincent (ph) and Teraza (ph) were considered family. This is the same unit. It's not something upstairs- downstairs. We are sitting there in this synagogue about three weeks.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><p>There is nothing you can do. Suddenly there is nothing you can do. You can't flee you don't know where to flee. You don't know what happened to your parents.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: When he came, with the carriage and the horse. And they put us in the ghetto. And what the Germans did they said, "Now we are going to form a ghetto. And this is after the war will be over then you will go back to your houses." I mean, they did everything to avoid a revolution. How do you avoid revolutions? Drops of hope. Okay we'll come back. And so immediately there was an organized lot to make sure you are managing the ghetto. And the police. And (other language spoken) which means, those who -- we'll give you four or five people we'll give you one room. They gave us one room. The room was a kitchen we had to share with another two or three families. If not the very convenient the grown-up girl too, but it wasn't the worst. This wasn't the worst.

<dialogue class=""><p><p>Because they understood that something wrong was going to be here. They said, "What do we do?" So a secular Jew, who doesn't believe in God, goes to the rabbi. Go to the rabbi and ask the rabbi what to do. Rabbi Shapiro. "Rabbi, what shall we do?" And they say, "I need to look in the holy books. I can't tell you -- come later, come to our later." I said yes you have to report. And they said Elkes which was the head of the ghetto, said, "uh, why, Rabbi Shapiro, do we have to report? Let them take me wherever they want." "No, but if we are organized maybe a few people will stay alive. And they will tell. What they did to us." So, here I am to tell you what they did to us. It is eh,5 o'clock in the morning, 6 o'clock in the morning and there were two murderers Rauca and Jordan (ph).</p></p></dialogue>

And they should stay feminist, and they will stay home, we will kill them on the spot, which they did. And then they stick to the left is the good side and the right is the bad side. And I look at my family and I say they need walking partner. They can't still walk. All right with all of us. Even for me, I said. But what would they do with the little one? He is now spoiling the whole thing.</p><p>Because of him he'll go to the bad side. But the police was the good side. Where the establishment was, there was a good side and there was a bad side. All the other, mainly women and children. And I said "Aye aye aye." But when we same to Rauca (ph). I put like this. Very tall family. My father was very tall. My mother was also tall woman. My sister was tall. And even I was tall. To my age.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Excuse me. To the left.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's all right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And so you remember that. Do you remember what Rauca looked like? And what happened after that? How did your parents -- do you remember any details from that day? <span class="page-break" number="57"></span> ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion ss</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We were, I wouldn't say happy but we were content in the good side and it was heartbreaking. Because they took all of them there and cried and they stood there in the little ghetto. They all were part of the ghetto. If you saw it. In the ghetto was a bridge.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>We probably say it many times and they put them in the ghetto and from there, there was already one action before. Dr. Elkas (ph) went back then please save this he wanted to save and he was beaten. And then they, the very same day or the next day we say them going up the hill to Fort Number Nine. You know where it is?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes. But tell us what is Fort Number Nine?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Fort Number Nine is the killing spot for the Jewish people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In Kaunas.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Or maybe some none Jewish people as well. Fort was one the nine forts or ten forts that surrounded Kaunas during the Russians built a -- a kind of fort to protect and defend Kaunas. And even today when you go and see, have you been? Have you seen the little guns there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I don't recall that. I've been there but I don't recall that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We have to go very, very down. The trenches were already ready. We saw them going uphill. And they were shot on the very same day. And later on burned. This was the big action because they needed the great action. The problem is there are less and less people coming because the people are dying out.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: This is a sad day for us. A sad day for me. Because I saw it with my own eyes and I heard it in my own ears, the shooting. <span class="page-break" number="58"></span> ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion so</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You could hear the shooting?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, there was a lot of shooting. It was again, women and children. There was very little to do. What could they do? Nothing. Maybe some of them they put in the cells. In Fort Number Nine. But when they killed, the German Jews and the French Jews, they, put them in the cells first and then they killed them. There's a story from one girl. She lives here in New York somewhere. She says Jordan (ph) came, and rescued their family because her mother was a seamstress. What happened then is fairly quiet years. It doesn't mean there were quiet years because people got shipped to Estonia. And for work and then they were killed. And they were shipped to all kinds of to -- Shancy (ph).</p></p></dialogue>

And there was a kind ofa little camp so when they did make the list, they -- we didn't know if it was better or worse. What would happen to the Jews?</p><p>But I, personally, understood that I have to belong to the establishment. And this will be the policy. This will be my insurance policy for my family.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: By establishment, what do you mean?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Establishment is the police, the work office, and Unrat (ph). This is what we call establishment. Maybe there is another word in English for it.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Iwas asking maybe they need a messenger. And I knew the Jewish -- I knew there was a German S.R. And a Jewish manager.
