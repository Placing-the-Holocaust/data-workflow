<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He didn't really talk about them too much. As I say, by the time he was talking to me there was this rift.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you know what it was due to?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: It was a lack of appreciation for what he had done for them. It was a lack of acknowledgment and he just couldn't get over that. So he just turned his back on them.</p><p>It was very painful. <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Kitty Weiss Penner 11</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I can imagine or I can't imagine actually.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well it meant that you know we didn't have any supportive family around.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: A little bit, yeah. Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you have any memories of her?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Just that she was very tiny. Very tiny and she didn't speak German. She spoke Yiddish and we didn't have much, much contact. Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Kitty Weiss Penner 12</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't think they were you know really committed to orthodoxy but the trappings of orthodoxy. Kosher home and food and observation of major holidays. I don't think the, the real ethnic deepness of the Jewish religion was something that they actually felt connected to.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Even your grandparents" generation?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I think I think it was just --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Tradition.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, just the trappings of it. I don't think they were intellectually rooted in Judaism.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did the children that means your father and his siblings, what kind of schooling did they get?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My fa, well as I said my father left school by the time he was 14. And he was very frustrated with the schooling because it was German one day and then they'd come back from a vacation and they, everything was in Polish. Then everything was in Russian.</p><p>And he just lost patience with the whole thing. He just said to heck with it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well that's what happens when borders change. <span class="page-break" number="11"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now your mother, let's turn to her side of the family. Where was your mother from?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My mother was born in Vienna.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And what was her maiden name?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Her maiden name was Zehngut, which means ten times good. And her parents were Austrian. Her father was a photographer and a inventor. He invented a washing machine and he invented all kinds of useful things but he never made money. He never made money at that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Sometimes it's not the inventors who do. It's the people who take their ideas and market them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right and there were no patents and everything. But he was a very kindly person, very generous and very nice.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember him? <span class="page-break" number="12"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Kitty Weiss Penner 14</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Barely, barely. I remember my mother's impressions of him where he was very gentle and very kind to the girls. She had two sisters and she was the youngest. And her mother was, her maiden name was, the mother's maiden name was Ernestina Deutch.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Ernestine German.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. And she had several siblings whom I knew. And she actually was the breadwinner of the family and she did sewing which many of the women did in those days, because everything was hand made. Clothing was hand made. And so she supported the family. And she was you know she had a tough job. She had a tough job.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: At a time when that wasn't acknowledged so easily or almost at all by society that women were supporting families, more than men were. Some of them ended up in such a predicament. Was your maternal side of the family well to do or struggling do you think?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think they were struggling. I think they were struggling to be middle class. But they valued culture. They loved to go to the opera and dances and beautiful clothes and Vienna was sort of a, I don't know, high class place like Paris and New York.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Before the Austro-Hungarian empire fell it certainly was. <span class="page-break" number="13"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Kitty Weiss Penner 15</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, yes. and the trappings are still there. The Baroque buildings and the opera and museums and that's still there. And the art and the music. Very, very proud of it, the Austrians. Especially the Viennese.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you know much about your mother's side of the family, if they had been Viennese for generations. Or whether they had come from someplace else?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well with the name of Deutch. I would guess that maybe they were sort of more from Germany and her father, Zehngut, had a branch of the family that was in Eisenstaedt, which is, well it was the mining area, probably more to the east. So there is some relationship there. So it was Austria.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Within those lands, within the German speaking lands--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Exactly, exactly. And the Austrian empire, the Hungarian empire was quite extensive.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was your mother's first name?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Stella.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Stella. And so her maiden name was Stella, she was Stella Zehngut. <span class="page-break" number="14"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were they very different as people?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think so. I think they were, I think my mother was very proud of her Austrian heritage and sort of lauded it over my father who was, who was the country bumpkin.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well you know I didn't want to ask it quite like that but these are different worlds.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>The world of Vienna even if you are let's say in a lower middle class and the world of the town I can't pronounce.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Knihynicze.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Knihynicze, the world of Knihynicze are two different ones and you know when they're blended you know how do they mix. <span class="page-break" number="15"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p></p></dialogue>

He could design something new and did. I have some of his furniture that he made for me. Yes. Made here in the United States. So he was, he was really, I think he was a genius. If he had, had any schooling he would have god knows where he would have been. But and my mother was very, you'd have to call it shtultz, she was very proud. And snooty. Kind of snooty. I have to say that. Yeah and so she always liked pretty things and made sure that her girls had pretty things. And that sort of thing. But she was a very strong woman. I mean she, she was the one who signed us up to come to America. My father was in Knihynicze taking care of things there. He was out of town at the time. And she signed us up. When he came home it was fait accompli.</p></p></dialogue>

And it's only later that they discover that their fathers are people too. My father seemed brusque and he was very powerfully built so he was a little scary.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was he a handsome man?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was state side, state side. No he supported his family through thick and thin.

And they were going to bring 50 children out of Vienna.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't think she ever got out from under that cloud of responsibility. And she just had very different interests. And I was successful in ways that she was not. And that was hard. That was hard for her because she felt that she had blazed the trail and that I had an easy time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You said that before.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: So for instance I, I mean we both did well at school and stuff and, and skipped you know the New York City school system if you did well, they didn't know what to do with you. There was no such thing as enrichment. They just pushed you ahead so that you were in the next class.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well the very earliest memory is of a curtain in probably in the nursery which sort of we, they were casement windows, which means that they rolled out. And when the breeze came in, it would lift this curtain which was very airy and lightweight. And it would lift this curtain up and I just thought of a giant outside the window breathing in and out because the curtain would rise up and then fall. It would rise up and fall. And I remember the fabric so distinctly. It was pale sort of a pea green with white leaves ovoid leaves scattered throughout the curtain. And there was a heavy thread running the warp of the fabric to make it hang right. And if I ever ran into that I would know that fabric in a minute. <span class="page-break" number="65"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Kitty Weiss Penner 67</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Isn't that amazing.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And that was, it was the very earliest memory that I had.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right. repetition, you know in and out, in and out. And we were on the second floor so it had to be a giant.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So are we talking second floor American or second floor European.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Vienna.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So it would be the third floor in the United States because there's the adgeschloss and then there is the first floor and then there is the second floor. that's the way it is in Europe.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right, well of course that was all that my parents talked about was what was happening in Europe and my mother had her family there. And received letters periodically that had big pieces censored out [gestures "censored pieces"), black marks cut. And so she pieced it together that her father was dying of cancer. And, and pretty soon those letters stopped.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did your father ever say to your mother you were right. I was wrong.</p></p></dialogue>

And he was just he was humiliated in front of these strangers who were family. I don't know what her motivation was. Maybe she was just stupid. You know she could have been stupid. Or she you know this was before social security and things like that. Maybe she thought that she would do better by throwing herself on these relatives. And my father was just more than incensed.</p></p></dialogue>

He said there was no god if this could happen and ne just turned his back on the whole thing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Wow. Because so many other people had the reverse thing. They did not particularly feel themselves to be Jewish and then when they were targeted said all right now. I'm not going to pretend to be someone I'm not. Did that seem strange to you at the time or is just that's his choice and that's her choice.</p></p></dialogue>

It was--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: What about you and your sister?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My sister felt more connected to, to her Jewish heritage. She when they were in Florida, she participated at a temple. I never have. And her daughter also seems more connected to the Jewish heritage and not that she keeps a kosher home but she you know she's connected to the community. And I'm not.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was this a conscious thing or is the way you developed in your interests and how they grew?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well I'm an atheist and I just from my experience and my reading I have come to that conclusion.

They I mean some people just disappeared like Tager. And I think one of my father's brothers just disappeared like a blown leaf. We did know that my grandfather passed. And we knew that Olga and her mother, my grandmother, were pushed from one apartment to another. I always thought that they were together, but I subsequently learned that they also were separated.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did you discover this?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: A friend, a cousin of my ex-husband is very savvy on the internet and she puzzled it out.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So it's a recent knowledge.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, yes. I always had a little fantasy that somehow they went off to the Vienna woods and hid. And survived.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: As you were growing up, tell me a little bit about school, about high school, about how did your life develop. <span class="page-break" number="79"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Kitty Weiss Penner 81</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well I enjoyed school. I had friends in school. I applied to the high school of music and art which was a special high school that you auditioned for in New York. And I prepared a portfolio and auditioned and was accepted. And that was probably the biggest learning experience.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was it really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, cause I was with a wide variety of people, very diverse student body from all over the city. Some very well-heeled people, some people who were very political. There was one gal whose father was a died and hard communist. There were people of color which was unusual. That wouldn't' have been in the neighborhood school. There was a Chinese girl that I was very friendly with, Gloria Wong. And when the communists took over in China, I hadn't a clue. I said well what do you think? And she said I think it's going to be a better thing for China. This was the era of the Rosenberg trials. And it was very, it was still very conflicted. It was still very, the world was coming to my awareness.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's normal when you're in high school. That's what happens you know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: But I was so happy at that school. I just, I just blossomed. I couldn't wait for summer vacation to end and go back to high school, which is not your typical high school experience. <span class="page-break" number="80"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Kitty Weiss Penner 82</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: No it isn't.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But I was very lucky. Yeah. and I still have friends from high school. Yes. And then when I went off to college, it was a total disappointment. It was not as stimulating as high school.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Where did you go to college?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well I started out at Brooklyn College. Which was free. The city colleges of New York, I mean totally unbeknownst to anybody today were free. Just like high school and so I would meet my friends on the subway. There was quite a little contingent that went from the Bronx to Brooklyn. Brooklyn College, because they had a very interesting art department. And but of course you know it was a liberal arts school and so I had classics and I had history and I had language and yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But it wasn't as stimulating.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, it was not. It was a come down. We had artists. I mean it was sort of like a carry- over from the WPA projects where they hired artists in the art department to teach. So I had Mark Rothko as a teacher. The poor man could not put two words together. He was a wonderful artist but he was not a teacher. I had Clyfford Still and William Bazeotis and all these fabulous names today. They were struggling artists at the time. Anyway they <span class="page-break" number="81"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Kitty Weiss Penner 83 were not good teachers. And so I decided that and I really wanted to know about art. I wanted to know the background and so I was interested in art history. And Barnard College at that time was investing heavily in their art history department. And I was told to apply and I did and I got in and so I have a degree from Barnard College which is prestigious.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: A question. You mentioned the different languages when you were at home at lunch time and going back to school. Did that every change. Did you ever end up speaking English at home?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think, I think yes. As the years went by. They understood. My parents understood more than they could speak. My mother was pretty proficient but my father there, never, I mean he spoke Yiddish.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did he speak any other language besides German and Yiddish. Did he speak Polish, did he speak Russian, did he speak--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: He just had a few phrases and he even had what, he had an English phrase like son of a bitch. Somebody when he was a kid had come back and taught him son of a bitch and he used that.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: He knew that from then. <span class="page-break" number="82"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Kitty Weiss Penner 84</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes he knew that from Knihynicze.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Isn't that funny. Did you ever feel like you were an outsider when you were in the United States.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [shakes head "no" No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So there was no sense of I don't really belong to this society. I'm from over somewhere else.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Never. [shakes head "no" Not in New York, not in Connecticut, not in Maine. No, I just it's where I'm at.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you ever think of Vienna.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: ve gone back to visit.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I want to come to that point about returning to your story. You mentioned that you are writing your memoirs.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Mm hm. <span class="page-break" number="83"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Kitty Weiss Penner 85</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: what prompted you to look back and when did you start looking back?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think P've always been sort of an introspective person. And I realized that my grandchildren who are not near and have not been close to me or I to them. Cause they" ve always grown away, grown up away from me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You mean geographically distant?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. But you know geographic distance also means emotional distance. And knowledge and knowing somebody. So I thought that I would clue them and help them out to know me a little better.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And that's what's prompted the memoirs?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Correct, correct.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How far along have you gotten?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well I can't say it's a thing that goes chronologically from here to there. It's a series of stories. Of things that happened. Of things that I've thought about. And we'll put them together in some kind of a scrapbook and that'll be it. <span class="page-break" number="84"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Kitty Weiss Penner 86</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Those are the kinds, the most precious gifts now.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [hope so, I hope so.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When did you first go back to Vienna?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My sister has gone back several times. And then one time, we went together. And we went with my niece also, Tina, her daughter. And well my sister had some money there.</p><p>And she filed for social security basically where she paid into the system and then accumulated money out of the system, which, which was effective if she spent the money there. In Europe. And so she was motivated to use that money. I never bothered to pay into the system. I don't care about it and I don't want it. And she planned to live to be a hundred so she would use it all. That didn't quite work that way. So we went back hm, I'm trying to think of when. In the 90s. And maybe 92 or so. And we went to Rohdenstern Gasse. And we went to the Prater and we went to the Vienna woods and we went to the opera. And then Pat and I, my partner, went to Vienna also as part of a trip that included Budapest and Prague. And I don't like Vienna. I find it stuffy, baroque and false, pretentious. I don't, I don't like it at all.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Is there anything that was familiar or did you, when you went you felt like you were kind of to a place you had never been before? <span class="page-break" number="85"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> Interview with Kitty Weiss Penner 87</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I was tourist, I was a tourist. I had my eyes open and I was curious and we went to Salzburg, went to a play there. It turned out to be a play about an old age home and my sister said oh, why do we want to go to see that. Cause it interests me. I didn't get all the nuances of the language but I got enough of it. But it was interesting, it was interesting. We went to performances and I thought that they were just stuffy. They were for tourists. There was nothing with heart. We went to Bratislava which was just recently liberated from Russian domination and we went to the opera. And they were, they could have been bus drivers. It just had, they were just doing a job. You know they had no heart. They had no emotion in to the part. It was just a businessman's opera. It was, it was nothing. It was just nothing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What a disappointment.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, cause my parents loved opera. And we went to the opera in New York. We went to the City Center and we went to the Met.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You have mentioned off camera that in 1998 I believe it was you went to Auschwitz.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I did.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell me about that trip and what that was all about. <span class="page-break" number="86"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Kitty Weiss Penner 88</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well it's something called the March of the Living. And apparently, well it's a Jewish organization that tries to get young people to understand the Holocaust and their heritage first hand. So they were mostly young people, but there were some survivors.</p><p>And we were ona bus. And I made friends with several people. One of whom, Sophia Afariat was spent the war years in Poland. And she spoke fluent Polish so she had the advantage of language. And we went to restaurants and things like that and she could speak fluently with people. We went to Krakow. We went to Warsaw. And went to some of the stations that Jews were assembled. We went to the ghetto. It was the first time that I was with very devout Jews. The young people were devout. They prayed, on the airplane. So that was the first. And then we went to Israel. (pause, something happening off camera) We have to stop every time that door opens and closes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What are the most memorable moments for you of that trip.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: For the trip. Well seeing Krakow which my father had spoken of was a high point. I thought that well, um, Warsaw was just a gray depressing place. We had a bus that took us from one place to another. We had guards on the bus. We had a Polish soldier who was on leave earning extra money, accompanying us on the bus.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And the purpose of his presence? <span class="page-break" number="87"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Kitty Weiss Penner 89</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well there's a lot of anti-Semitism, a lot of anti-Semitism. We went to a little village I don't even know that it had a name. But it was a typical village, shtetl, town. The Jewish synagogue, and there were no more Jews living there but it somehow, I don't know who took care of it. So the synagogue had, was neatly tended. And the church was on the top of the hill. So the church was on the hill. And the synagogue was down here. [gestures location of church and synagogue] There was a contingent of Polish soldiers, with a tank stationed at the synagogue. They were playing cards. But there was a military presence.</p><p>We passed houses that were very derelict that probably had not been lived in for a number of years. We passed another place that was like a farm where they were very neat and tidy. They had cranes nesting in this chimney. I'd never seen anything like that and that was a tidy farm. So you know if the people who had the place could take care of it, had the wherewithal to take care of it, had the energy and the skill and maybe some money to take care of it, they did well. If the people were old, poor, the place was derelict.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So you saw these types of things--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I saw that yes. This lady Sophia, who had spent the war. She was able to talk to our guard and sort of befriend him and find out who he was. And that's how I know that he was on furlough and stuff like that. We went to a place in Krakow that was sort of a folk art place. And I wanted to buy something for my grandchild who was little at the time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>My first grandchild. And so we bought something there. And I brought it to the hotel, <span class="page-break" number="88"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Kitty Weiss Penner 90 opened it up and it had shattered into you know 42 pieces. So the next day we went back and I said well you know this, you packed it poorly. I need something else. And oh, no.</p><p>No they wouldn't, they wouldn't' honor that and so Sophia said we are Jews. And she played the Jew card. I was so embarrassed. I was so embarrassed that she felt it necessary to draw that card. And he said ok, pick out something else. We went to a Jewish cemetery and there was this little old lady scuttling through the cemetery. And Sophia started talking to her. And she had spent the war. She was Jewish. She had spent the war there. She, she had no prospects of going anywhere else.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The lady in the cemetery?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. And that was her life. I don't know, I think she was doing a short cut through the cemetery to her home. Yeah. And she lived in that town with her daughter.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you feel in some way distant from these things or close to these things?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, I felt close to that, I did. It was very emotional.
