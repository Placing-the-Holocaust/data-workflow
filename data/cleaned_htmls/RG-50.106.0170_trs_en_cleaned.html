[indecipherable] came from -- we don't know the answer, from the universe, and -- and these -- and you see now where they -- at that time they say [indecipherable] or we've got natural catastrophe, you know, you co -- you believe what happen in the old time.

No, it's a -- no, it's the -- you know, in the -- when I was retired, came this thing with the Belgium, you know, amnesty here and say you can get the [indecipherable] you can think this because then union from the job. And -- and then came this bulletin from the Diaspora, you know, you see. This is a bulletin which is written by a group of progressive Jews in -- in Belgium, were -- who are trying to -- to have the Belgium state recognized, their capability during the war, which has not done, contrary let's say to -- to France. And who introduced through politicians, some legislation on that, but until now, even under social democrat government they don't move. They have ceremonies, etcetera in Malines, or in other places where there is Jewish past history, but they don't recognize the culpability of the state, saying that most of the arrest,</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="104"></span> </p><p> 108 Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 etcetera were done by Belgium policemen and gendarmes. You know, they -- the German were not to be seen too much, but for the Jewish case was this guy named [indecipherable] and many collaborators, you know? The German was using them until a certain point, you know, when, in "43 they were losing the war, and then they -- they had to -- to compli -- dominate every sector of the population and against the resistance, which was so and so, so and so because after the war, practically everybody was a resister. And -- and things like that. Then -- then that was the -- the case, and it's only now that they came with this, they ca -- like they came to me with these veteran question. I never ask anything, you know, they say you -- you are Korean veteran, you are a-allowed to get this 500 euro, 700 dollar for this, and [indecipherable] for that.</p><p>And then they came with the restituti -- [indecipherable] then this group, who was [indecipherable] try also to fight anti-Semitism in Belgium, which you know is rising like many place in Europe. Not through violent acts, but through, you know, speeches by the extremist right and things like that. And also they are attacking the -- the -- the Belgium government to av -- agree that all the funds from the restitution be divided between the survivors or the son of the survivors, and -- and given to the creation of a Jewish foundation of things like that. And I became interest because I -- I think, learning what happened here with the claims, with Eisennstadt and with Eggenberger, th-that it's not acceptable. That the priorities should not be there hundred and hundred of thousand of salaries that they get.

Then I wrote to the guy, he was a -- he was Jewish, [indecipherable] and -- who send me all those photo and reports and things like that, which I think is -- is quite important because there were so many, and answer indirectly your question, I was not brief on when they came, what was their history.</p><p>You know, anyone is that, and what's -- what happened exactly with my brother, my father-in-law, with my mother's resistance to all that, I -- wha -- wha -- what is the truth was not the truth, you know, in this thing.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Ah, yes, and you know, it's the general knowledge of the danger of authoritarianism and dictatorship and the rise of it and the fact that in Europe, twice the United States had to come to rescue them, that they did it.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: By that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, yes and no, it's more on the political level again, because I was in charge of a program called -- the first program called Islam against the Islamists, to make the difference between the two, you see, and -- and -- and again, there's nothing religious, it is a group of power monsters, who will do anything to access to the control of a state, uh-huh, and the -- in the Koran, everybody knows that i-i-it's -- it's like the Catholicism, a-and -- and the other form, built on the -- o-on an evolution, which -- which show only that with the raise of Islam, we see that they are as primitive like the Catholics were hundreds of years ago, of the Jewish, etcetera. Then this is more on that kind of level, and the fact that this has to be -- has to be stopped because there are new factors, okay, meaning -- especially in western Europe, with the immigration from our country. We have the problem here, we have another, the Latin American immigration, etcetera, who is different, of course, from the Jewish immigration, or the Belg -- the Belgium. I found in the paper so many story where Belgium descendent, even this -- to make a joke, this D.C.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Ma -- no. That was not -- not all. Because I made such a difference between a heritage and a situation. And -- and -- and I never asked to go in the Belgian army to defend so-called the king, okay? The king, for me, was a -- a collaborator, the first one, during the war, of course, huh? Meaning that I put this all in -- in perspective.</p><p>And I didn't come, mind you, American before, I was here seven years. You have to wait five years, a -- two more years, and as w-we talk about the legendary Irving Brown, he say, you know, one thing done, forget your heritage, okay?

Where people can be convinced, you know, that Clinton was a great president, or you know, it may be, maybe not, but anyway, he's not one of the greatest in this country anyway. A-And -- and the same can be said from -- from the president, who is now here. It is a -- a -- a -- a state of the development of country, of nation, and of the political life. What we can control, and what we cannot control. What a free society means. And now came all those great [indecipherable] thinker even today, in [indecipherable] etcetera. He said, election is not a proof of democracy. But we knew this many, many years, that you know, the fact impose, practically, an election, doesn't mean anything in many countries of the world. Either it's still tribal and you talk about feeling of nationality there -- th-th-th-th-their responsibility is vis-a-vis their tribe. It's not the [indecipherable] their country.

But they -- there were some lecture, you know, on -- on Jewish life, etcetera. There were artistic group, etcetera. And we knew that we choose Maccabee, not to be in the Zionist group, or not to be in the traditional Orthodox Jews, which didn't exist anyway in Brussels, they were all in Antwerp, you see. And -- and then we -- we had many debates, you see? But the ones who are here were the -- the ones who -- who -- who  <span class="page-break" number="115"></span>  119</p><p> Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 decided to -- to move on, you know, with the briti -- with the Jewish background and - - and that's it.

This was the Jewish state and this was the -- let's say an history was started much earlier, under the British empire and [indecipherable] and all that, yes. And of course we will -- defended -- there's no -- no -- when I visit the afri -- the -- the Arab countries, my boss, Irving Brown at that time, when we were in Tunis [indecipherable] the Palestinian came a-and want to talk to Irving. Irving says, go to David. He didn't want to talk to them. Then we sit down and I said, glad to talk to you, okay, but if you raise the question of Israel, there's no deal, okay? Can talk about anything you want. At that time they didn't even want -- they were not talking about a Palestinian states or nothing. They want just to be anti-Israeli and a colonial state, or an imperial state. I had many contact, but again, through the years he became very dangerous, you know, in terms that we were close from the -- the exile group, even from inside and outside the Tunisian of the [indecipherable] Algeria. And people were -- my friend were assassinated. It is another story, I can tell you where we had, for instance, the liberation movement against the French in Algeria.

Some were assassinated in Paris, which I knew and I was very con -- of course, concern about it. But again, when you talk to a -- a guy like Irving Brown, he accepted that [indecipherable] and never talk about that. His best friend die [indecipherable] never talk about that. And we were involved in all kind of operation, etcetera, and -- and as a joke with my wife and children, when I was awarded, you know, commander honor of this award, national award, you know, th -- of this officer, of that, and the other, and chevalier -- knights of that. Senegal and -- and Doumay, and -- Senegal, Doumay, and oh, what's the third?</p><p>Togo, huh. And I came back each time so proud of the men [indecipherable] that they laugh at me. And the na -- the big, you know, diploma, I wanted to put this in my little [indecipherable] no, no. It's only -- it's a true story, of course, like everything I told you, of course. I brought it from the basement and I put it back, two of them. One is too big in the -- in my guestroom, and the other one is too big, I -- I left in that. And then people are asking me, but why did you get? I say, look, this is to organize a ch -- regime change, the other was to oppose one. And -- and things like that. But that's another aspect, and I think it's very well describe in -- in several books.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was your reaction during the Eichmann trial, do you remember?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh yes, of course.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, the whole tragedy o-of that period, of course. And when there is -- I don't know whether before, I was going some movie a-about, you know, Eichmann arrest, or about the -- the thing, but you know, in the book on the Belgium deportation that there is upst-upstairs [indecipherable] that I have it at home, you know, with the list of the convoy, etcetera, there is, at the end, the trial in Kohn, Germany of the mi -- the one who did all that in Belgium, okay? H-he went free after five years. Then, for me it's another a-aspect, it's a -- it's really showing that -- that the society evolves, that this thing of remembrance, it's -- i-i-i-it's something personal, but when you are involve in all those acts, there is no justice, you know, only for the few.</p><p>[indecipherable] Nuremberg and all that, it's only a few, what, 20 people, or 50 people. Of course, what we did with denazification in Germany was excellent, of  <span class="page-break" number="118"></span>  122</p><p> Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 course, excellent. And th-there became, like in Italy, etcetera, recognition that people have to live with the regime that they have, you know, and as I mentioned before, the populace, the people are -- are subject to so much more [indecipherable] that today's -- even an election in a s-so-called civilized country has different meaning for different people.</p></p></dialogue>

I don't think that they show any -- you cannot s -- have any remor -- or any comment, you know. I-I went back because they have something of a list, my aunt who ca -- before she fa -- came here and then before she died -- you know, there is -- her name is on it, but her husband name is not on it, you know.
