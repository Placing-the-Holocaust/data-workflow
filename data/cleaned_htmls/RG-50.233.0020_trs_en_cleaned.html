<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Or do you want to say anything about maybe when you were working in the towns or ?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I was --. Well, I had one incident when I was working in the towns. This would take too long, it's not so terribly important.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Where was your family during all this? Were they still in Slonim?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My family was still in Slonim; they got jobs. My father could no get a job because he was a businessman; he was stamped a businessman. {It was an undesirable }. Undesirable so he got a place to protect it; he got a job as a watchman at night. Watchman in a little factory or whatever it was.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So your family's standard of living was reduced?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Standard of living was completely reduced. The only thing is we're still had merchandise but we hide it when the Russians came in. We hide like yard goods, so we still had something all the time to trade and still live a better life than {the average person under Russian occupation, they didn't have it}. We still had something left plus they were pretty well off before so we still had some money and some jewelry.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you see your family often while you were working?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: While I was working, yes. I used to come in, not so often, but quite a few times I came home. In fact, maybe I should tell you this first. I had one incident, like I say before. I had my own equipment to show the movies; I had a generator. I left the generator in a school and locked up the school. Somebody broke into the school and they stole the generator. In the time when I went, I didn't let him know, the weekend, I went to see my family, I went to Slonim. Came back and the generator was stolen. Now the main problem with stolen generator, you cannot replace it. You cannot go out and buy another one. [ You can't <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection replace anything}. Cannot replace it. So the only thing I was awaiting is jail for negligence. The war broke out otherwise I would be in jail.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It happened within weeks after --?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It happened in weeks before the war broke out. A few weeks before the war broke out. So almost the war saved me from going to jail. The war broke out; the night when the war broke out, I was on a date with a beautiful girl. At twelve o'clock, after midnight, I heard the artillery and the war started. I immediately after the date, I came home and even here, the shooting, the shelling was getting much heavier and I immediately packed my little knapsack and I start walking home with it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Walking home?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Walking. Only by foot, I could not go any other way. On the way a lot of things happened.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You were walking from Grodno?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No from Oftryn. It's a small town where I worked.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can you spell that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: O-f-t-r-y-n. [ll try to find out maybe exactly. {yeah, that's the way you spell it}.</p><p>So immediately I start going to the direction to see my family. I go back to Slonim. On the way already, the Germans were bombing the roads; the Russians were flying in trucks. The ones that were going were bombed. The villages were burning and the roads were clogged up. What more incident is that the Germans came with planes and start bombing the place where I was walking. It was a dogfight, the Russian planes came right to the place where the pilot parachuted. I was there when the Russians the ones that were walking too, were on foot. Four Russian soldiers were on foot running back to Russia, the border. I was there when they shoot the pilot.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The German pilot?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The German pilot. It happened that they walk away and I went after and got his gun. I took his gun, hid his gun and I walked to my house, back to Slonim. On the way, all the villages were burning and it was safe to come home. In fact, it happened on the road. Until I came to Slonim. Slonim was already occupied by the Germans so immediately right before I came to the city, I threw away my gun, was a pistol. They arrested me and they ---. Every male in Slonim they arrested.</p></p></dialogue>

The only thing is what we had, we had some cloth what we buried in the ground to hide from the Russians. This, we still have because it was hidden in the ground so we still have that. The other encounter what I had was that they took out 1,500 men. It was my father and I was one of them. They took us to the marketplace surrounded by Germans all the way around and we didn't know where they were taking us. They told us they're taking us for labor. A few hours later, trucks were coming in through the courtyard and the same thing happened in the courtyard because we had some real important Jews from the community leaders. The rabbi, the chassan and some other community leaders were there too so they were beating them up, were telling them to sing Sh'ma Yisroel, other Jewish songs and told us why don't you sing to your God. Maybe your God will help you. All the time</p><p> . Trucks were coming in and we were loading up the trucks, about 35 or 40 people on every truck and took them away.

It was an open ghetto they called it. All of us had to wear yellow patches, not Stars of David, but a round patch, a yellow one in front of the garment and in the back.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: {If you were found, you would be punished.

The photographer told us something is going to happen. Plus another sign was that they gave special scheins to special tradesmen. They gave special permits.

We couldn't find too many pistols available, but just parts and we assembled them inside the ghetto.

This was a very good job, very good pay in food, mainly food. I had plenty of food for me, had plenty of food for my girlfriend. Goodies like fried food, we could have everything when we were working there. You know, the Germans had plenty of food. On the job, we had all the food but on June 29, they surrounded the ghetto. They blocked up the ghetto; a special kommando came into the city and they announced nobody could go out to work. Nobody could go in or out of the ghetto. {By this time, the ghetto was already sealed. It was surrounded by barbed wires, tightly, with guards. It wasn't an open ghetto anymore}. It's no way you can get out. {No way you can get out}. No way you can get out of the ghetto. In the same evening, this was on a Sunday, the special kommando where they came into town, they needed schnapps. They needed liquor and rations, food. So they came to my boss, the officer, his name was Mr. Miller. They came to Miller and they asked him that he should give them, should go and give them ration of food. He told them I cannot give you any food unless you give me the eight Jews. {You release the eight Jews from the ghetto that work in my p , Pll give you the food. Because the Germans were only supervisors; they did the labor}. We did the labor; They didn't even now how to fill an order. {They had to unload also; it all came in huge quantities}. We had to unload so he told them he is going to take care of this. The next morning about six o'clock in the morning, the head of the kommando came into Miller, the captain of the German and they brought him a special permit to take out the eight Jews. He came to the gate and he told the German and the Jewish police to ask for Aron Dereczyaski and the rest of them.</p><p>Come out to the gate. The Jewish policeman came to my house; he knocked in the middle of the morning. By that time I want you to know that everybody was hiding in hiding places. Already we made hiding places in getting ready when the action comes so we build a hiding place. But I was still on the lookout and they came to my house and asked for me, Aron Dereczyaski. They told him, he was smart enough, they told him that Mr. Miller was waiting at the gate. I knew when he mentioned the word Miller I knew that it's legit, that I can come out and see Mr. Miller. The captain was telling me to get all the people together and in half an hour he'll be back and we'll go out to work. All right, he gave us a : he says don't worry --. {Nothing will happen to the Jews}. Nothing will happen to the Jews They found the underground organization on the Polish side. The Poles are organizing; they have an underground organization so we are going, the Germans, he said "we" the Germans are coming to go into the ghetto to check if the Poles are not hiding in the ghetto.

The action started exactly at seven o'clock but this story happened when they took us out, that happened before. The minute we walked out of the ghetto we could see all the special groups are all surround the ghetto with machine guns pointing at the ghetto like a real armed camp. You could see that like, for me, it was clear that the ghetto is being liquidated and it looks like nobody is going to be able to survive. Sure enough, they will not be able (?) to get out with life. We start walking and on the way we were stopped and checked our documents again. The high officer stopped us and checked us -- our permit. He let us go and it happened that Miller knew all the big shots because they all used to come to him for different kind of parties that they made.

The place in Malina, the hiding place, was discovered where they took out the people. I didn't give up and I looked for Lisa a little bit longer. I went to the back, in the back was a small little yard, was a little shack. I went to that shack and I start calling in Yiddish. I say is anybody hiding? {That's Aron, that's Aron, Lisa, are you hiding?} After a short while, I was calling their name, Lisa heard my voice and she was there hiding with her father and little brother. Before long, Lisa came down from the hiding place and I made an immediate decision that I'm going to take her out. Now she's a young girl, she was just 16. She was sixteen years old, "42 -- fifteen years old. {I was 15, 15 4}. Fifteen years old, very pretty, a good-looking girl. I decided that I'm going to take her out. So she parted with her father and brother. I took her next door to a place, not where she lived but a cousin lived from where she lived, right next door to each other. I took her with a little attic, I mean a little -- like a second floor. I went down in the house and I found a pair of pants and a jacket and a scissor. I looked all the way around. I cut her hair, I put her boy's clothes, men's clothes and a cap and I made her look like a boy. I took some PX wires, electric wires and I covered all the way around her neck. I did the same thing to another fellow and we had a couple of chandeliers so she carried a chandelier on top of her shoulder and the other fellow. We were four, the other fellows helped me do it by cooperating; I mean getting the chandeliers, both of us.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I found it, I pulled out some wires from the home because the home had a lot of wires. They're like extension wires; was running all over the apartments because we didn't have any electricity so they made their own. I mean we had electricity but wasn't like here, was plenty wires. {The electrical wires were always on the outside in Europe in the old homes. You didn't have to go in the wall to pull them out, they were hanging}. Hanging, so I pulled them out wires from the things and put them all the way around her neck.

I waved that piece of paper; I says here's my permit and here's my four men. He didn't check, he didn't look. {He didn't look at the permit}. He didn't look at the permit and he said for four men and he let us through. From there I went all the way to the prefanza, to my place of work. By the way, coming through the ghetto, the German dropped us off, the same guy that told us we would -- Fritz, it was Fritz, not Hans, it was Fritz. Fritz dropped us off the first time to come in, in the ghetto. Then what we supposed to do is; Miller and the rest of the Germans, they live across the street from the gate, right across.

I came to Miller, Miller was still home at that particular time, for lunch or whatever it was. I came to Miller; I asked him, I told him that I found my sister; how can we save her? So his answer was this place is not for hiding Jews. {My place is not for hiding Jews, get her out of here immediately}. Immediately. I took her out and she went into the basement. He didn't follow or look for anything. It was a basement and she was hiding in the basement, in Miller's basement. Over there, after a while, Miller left. Another German was there. {Also there was a young Jewish boy. I really wanted to insert this. There was a young Jewish boy that was working for them like a mascot, polishing their boots and shoes and helping the cleaning woman with chop the wood and everything.

Already my decision was made; the only way you can survive. I had no doubt that liquidation is going to come to Gr too. So the only way I was looking around is how I can find a contact with the underground. I lived through all the time in the Grodno ghetto. I did not make any contact with the underground. You can imagine how hard it was for a young man having experience, belonging to the underground, looked around, being a stranger in a ghetto. Because some people were asking questions, why didn't other people go to the underground. It's very hard for me to explain them that here is a young man, has no attachments, no family, trying to find a way how to go to the woods or to the underground.

So I was working over there with five other people. I went out to work as a carpenter and being over there, who took me in? a good friend of mine. He was working there so he said Aron you could be a carpenter, why don't you come out to work in this place. He worked -- I worked with him and over there we got acquainted with the name of this fellow Tadek. Tadek {bartered with him}. Tadek bartered with us. We brought in some different kind of watches from the ghetto and pants and some other clothing what we could put on us and then take it off and barter with him. {He would bring food}.

My two friends accepted it and after a few days, they went to him, to Tadek. Tadek supposed to send a note back. {No, Hershel, one of the people was supposed to send a note with Tadek that they arrived safely}. So one of my friends was supposed to send it, they give us a note that they send with Tadek that they arrived safely and they are safe. Because at that time, you couldn't trust anybody, you could tell the same Polish fellow. Any Pole could come and take away the money from you and give it to the Germans and get paid for it. The Germans would pay him for it. We didn't know, we weren't sure what it is. But he came a couple of days later to the place where I was working and he says that Hershel and Ludnik (?) that was their names, they're safe, they're in Vilna and in the Vilna ghetto.

That's the way we parted and I went back to the ghetto, coming back to the ghetto. I was immediately arrested. Everybody who came in back to the ghetto and they pushed us in a big synagogue. In the synagogue during the day accumulated approximately maybe three or four thousand people. I don't know how much the synagogue could take in. We stayed there all day and all night, all evening. It was probably about six, seven o'clock in the evening. It was six o'clock in the evening; all night more people were already in. The shul, the synagogue was already almost full from people coming from work arresting everybody. They kept us there all day, all night. I was looking for any place to hide. I couldn't find a hiding place. The next morning, about five o'clock in the morning, the Germans came in. They ordered us to get out from the synagogue and walk to the railroad station. That's what we did. We followed up, we walked in fours, we walked to the railroad station. I was looking for a place to run away, to hide. I could not find, the guards were too close. Here I am, already at the railroad station, put in a boxcar, locked after a short while, half an hour, an hour, two hours, who knows what the time was.

There was only a few. By that time already they start finding people hiding in the ghetto. Nobody was already out to work. They discovered all different kind of hiding places and they brought them into the synagogue. Before long -- anyway, the first day, I looked around, I did not find Lisa. The second day I had a better chance to look because I was the only from the first ones. I did not find Lisa. Till late in the evening, I looked around where can I hide inside the synagogue. I found a place in the synagogue, had a small little room where there was a kitchen before. Over there was a pile of coal. I saw a young fellow by the name Ruby Lawrence. {Ruvke Lubich!.
