<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, explain this to us. How did it happen?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: My parents divorced after I was born when my father did not believe that I was his daughter, and -- but then I -- they put me with a couple they paid monthly to raise me, and I was by then nearly one-and-a-half years, and my mother was a picaflor.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Isee. I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And so he -- he could not believe that I was his daughter, but when I grow a little bit older, I was the one what looked more like him. I had the same nose.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh. So that's how they -- you know, in those days they didn't have DNA testing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And my father always said he had a Catholic nose, and I am born with a Catholic nose like he had. So my -- they divorced, and my mother disappeared. I think she went to Brazil. She lived in Brazil then. And years later, my father had -- she had a son, no, my brother, and one day when the -- he went out, and he saw his son looking between garbage; said, "What you are looking?" He said he is hungry. "You are hungry. Where is your mother?" "At home." "And why you are here?" "She sent me out." And then my father went to the judge and said, "I like to have the right of my children." So my mother -- they took her right away as mother to take care of the children, and he raised me and his -- my brother.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That sounds like a very sad beginning.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And I think I can tell you I am grateful to her that she sent me the documents that I could come out from Germany, but she was a person that is very hard to believe.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Itis. It is. Tell me this, was your father -- were you close to your father as you were growing up?</p></p></dialogue>

I had varied caretakers, what my father took for the half of his house and for to raise his children. We spoke only German at home. I didn't learn another language. And some of them I liked much, but some not so. We had some of them that teach me from Jesus Christos. I think they wanted to convert me when I was five years old.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you would have -- you would have caretakers who wanted to -- who wanted to save your soul, in other words?</p></p></dialogue>
