I didn't see that seen them doing it, but I seen the ovens there, you know. I tried to take a picture, but it didn't come out. It blurred and stuff, all black. But you could still make out a little bit that it was the freight cars, them little freighters.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: After seeing Buchenwald, after seeing the concentration camp, did it change your attitudes about the war and why you were fighting it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. Then I realized that we had to do it, I mean, after all, otherwise it will kill everybody.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How long were you in Europe after V E Day? How long did you stay after?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, I stayed until the war was over in Japan, and then they shipped me back.
