My uncle got out of it because of -- I don't know how, but he stayed with us.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes. Then the war broke out [indecipherable] in "41, and the Jews were told, we were told that we would be evacuated and we had to be ready within 48 hours and we could only take whatever we could carry with us, whatever was on our backs and in a little knapsack. Even though I was only four years old, I do recall when they first came marching into town, my cousin had gone up to the attic and he was looking outside. And soldiers saw him and I remember they came knocking on the door with bayonets and my mother said for us to hide under the beds. So the children, we hid under the beds, and they said, where is this spy? She said there were no spies, this was a child that was looking out the window, she saw you marching. No, we saw a spy. And they came with the bayonets, they came into my mother's bedroom, that I do recall and they opened the closet door and were looking. And we were afraid, we were whimpering under the bed and they made us come out from under the bed. We were lucky, they didn't sh -- and my cousin admitted that he was the one that was looking at them, and my mother begged them and said, don't harm these children, my husband went into the war, he's a soldier and please don't -- don't harm them.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: There were -- I'm not exactly clear if they were German or Romanians who worked hand in hand with the German soldiers.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, okay, mm-hm. So then they left your house?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: She -- she dressed me. I-I didn't want to wear so many things.

And the funny part was that they took -- well, my mother took my father's suits, thinking that -- that when he would return she wanted some clothes for him. And she took his tallit. So that tallit was with us. She also took the down pillows and -- and some quilts along. So they really carried large bundles and then we had the -- the Jewish star on, that we had to wear.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: By that time you were --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: The yellow star.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yes.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: It meant that I was different. It was frightening. I saw a lot of people, we were packed like sardines and they didn't tell us where we were going, but they said our destination was Margulav, which afterwards turned out to be -- that was a death camp. However, my grandmother's half-brother was on that transport as well. He was very well-to-do.

I know I -- I had a terrible earache there, I remember that. And in the middle of the night my uncle disappeared and then he came back. And he said, we're gonna leave this transport. It's dangerous, but we're gonna leave because some of the Romanian soldiers were taking bribes and my grandmother had sewn some money in her bras and in her girdle. I had asked her why she was doing that and she said, well, I'm an old lady -- she considered herself old then, she probably was just in her -- her 40's -- if they shoot me, but we never know, it may save our lives. And sure enough, the soldiers who took the bribe, they took us over the Dniester, D-n-i-e-s-t-e-r river.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did you as a child see this, or you heard it --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I saw this. A soldier was holding me, and my mother's anguished look. He knew that she was on the verge of tears, she said please don't hurt my child. And he said -- there were -- really God answered me, I da -- I believe. He said, do not worry. I have a child this age at home, I am not going to harm her. I was blonde. I had brown eyes and I think he said I reminded him of his child. So there were kindnesses that I do remember and thank God that we did make it across.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And the reason I -- I asked, I said how come my mother wasn't -- I don't recall her being -- for some reason they had mercy, that if you had a small child, they didn't take you into the labor camp. Her sister worked in the tobacco fields and she also worked in an area where they dried apples and fruit and tomatoes. She wasn't allowed to -- she would have been shot if she would had taken any food out. Thus we experienced a lot of hunger. Whatever we could get, that's -- luckily my aunt, who was very handy with a needle and she -- she sewed beautifully and she knitted beautifully. And she found some people from home who were not Jewish, but they were also transported to this camp. The two women who gave her work to do on the side, and after she came home from labor, and in exchange, they would give her food here and there. So we would have a potato floating in the water. I would have a -- a piece of bread with some oil occasionally.</p><p>But as a child I remember you -- we found other -- even though I saw death, I saw people dying in the street and starving, they didn't have a roof over their heads, and as primitive as the</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

I remember going in a pail, having to go outside in the very bitter cold of the winter. My aunt and uncle stayed with us only for one year, but then they -- they left, they went to a different camp.

I call it butchered because they were, with farm implements, they killed each and every one of them. And they left the remains and they showed him the remains. And then for some reason they had mercy and shot him instead of killing him with the farm implements. And this man, this neighbor described it to my mother.

Of course they had no burial, none of them did, but at least he came back giving us when, the seventh day of Av, it's always two days before Tisha B'Av. For me it's a Tisha B'Av because from the time I was little I had to say Kaddish for him.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you know what Israel was?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: First of all, to a nine year old, it was my first taste of a formal Jewish school, where I was taught Hebrew, history -- we were like sponges, we were -- had a void in our lives. We didn't have much of a childhood, we didn't have time for play, we didn't have time for study. And suddenly we were given mathematics and -- a-and the thirst for knowledge was unbelievab -- we had wonderful teachers.</p></p></dialogue>

His daughter was on a Kindertransport to England, he didn't know if she was alive. He was 15 years my mother's senior, but people told my mother, who knew at the time she was probably going to go to the United States, but I -- my Zionism was, I think, embedded in me when I started going to the school there and the love of Israel and I will never forget the day that Israel was declared independent. We children -- the school was -- consisted of just maybe a hundred children. I have pictures of that, of DP camp. And yet we were so happy that those were happy times, cause we were free. And we danced all night in a bonfire and I told my mother, I am not going to the United States, I am going to tear up the papers. I'm a half an orphan, I wanted to go on the Exodus. My aunt did not -- even though she had two sisters</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

He refused to go to the United States. But my mother said, my only sister, she had -- there was a quota system then. My aunt got married to a Lithuanian Jew and -- who lost his entire family and they were allowed to come -- immigrate to the United States right away, they left in 1946 -- 47. deg46 - deg47. And we did not leave until "49, we had to wait for our quota system.</p><p>In the meantime we had our physical exams and many of the children in the school were found to have TB. I was in a camp -- they had diagnosed it three months before they even told my mother, and then they told her that I indeed had TB and I had to go to a sanitarium, they called it a sanitarium then. And it was not in the same town, it was in Augsburg. And here I was, nine and a half, 10 years old. My mother took me there initially and she left me with all the other children.</p><p>I was only able to see her once a week, it was not close. And when she came back and was looking for me, she said where is my daughter? And they said well, she is in quarantine. She has a bad case of TB and she cannot be with other children. So I was in that sanitarium for nine months. The treatment that I needed they only gave to people who had TB of the bones, not -- I had it in my lungs. And so they had to collapse a lung and th-the anti-Semitic nurses, they were not -- there were some people that were nice. The doctor that I had was wonderful, the Danish doctor who spoke to my mother. He said, I had TB as a child, I have a family now, don't worry, your daughter will be okay. But luckily we had family here, so my mother wrote to them in the United States saying that I needed streptomycin if they could possibly get it for me. In the meantime they had to perform surgery and the nurses would always tell me, you're going to go through this test, it's going to hurt. And they would give me tissues, you're going to cry. And so I believe that my tolerance for pain was established there because I showed them how brave I</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

I -- I had to show them. I would write letters to my mother trying to calm her down because [indecipherable] said don't worry, things will be okay. I -- and I remember my mouth, I had developed a terrible tooth infection, they had to send me to -- I had an abscess and I had to go through surgery, they sent me to a different hospital where suddenly I had my period at 10 and a half.

And we didn't have tampons, and we didn't have -- it was rags, that was disgusting. But then finally you know, and the Americans brought over the pads and things. But I was frightened. There was a very nice counselor from HIAS who -- who would come to see me and she brought me a lot of handiwork to do. I still have an embroidery that I did.</p></p></dialogue>

They performed surgery, I still have the scars. While I was under the knife, my mother came with the streptomycin -- this is before, and I used to get streptomycin shots every four hours all during the day and night. That was -- that was for three months. And after surgery I would console my mother, she just wished she had saved my letters, that I saw a bird and don't worry, I'll be fine and I'm feeling okay. But thank God I lived through it and came back to camp. My cousins couldn't even say goodbye to me, they went to Israel. In the meantime they left for Israel because they were not allowed, but my aunt would come with my uncle and then of course we had a wonderful reunion first time we went to Israel before the Yom Kippur war, my</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And I -I just can't describe it, how we felt. We both kissed the soil of Israel and we were just so thrilled. But also I've been very happy in the United States. I'm glad that, you know, I did go with my mother, cause we did have a loving family here. I met my father's sisters for the first time, who always sent packages while I was in the sanitarium. At that time they believed in feeding you. I was, you know, skinny after the war, but my fat cells grew in that sanitarium. Then they believed in feeding you a lot. Butter and all kinds of rich things. And they would send me clothing from my cousins and my cousins would blame me for being chubby. We had to eat because our cousin in Europe was starving.

We always had managed with costumes and things. But they were a handful of kids, there were only a hundred of us or so. And there were people that came, survivors who came to see the shows, and one woman sat next to my mother and she pointed to me. She said, who knows if -- if the parents of this child is alive.

And she said, well, thank God, I am the parent. She said, how lucky you are, and people who lost their children, it was so sad. And I learned Polish there because there were many kids who had been hidden in convents and they didn't speak a word, they didn't even know they were Jewish. And they didn't speak a word of Yiddish. So, in order for me to be able to converse, I learned the language. And people would start speaking Polish to my mother, said I don't understand. How come? Your daughter speaks Polish. Well, my daughter picked it up.</p></p></dialogue>

We had a reunion because we worked as volunteers for the army, three of us. And we never talked about it, I mean, we didn't think about it, cause then we were so ashamed. There was one teacher, he was an excellent teacher, but he would invite you to his home. He would say he was going to help us, you know, with the studies or whate -- very friendly, very nice man and I -- I was always lacking a fatherly figure. And -- but he always was touchy-feely, and you know, we were developing girls. And we never, you know, none of us shared it. We had a reunion, one of the survivors lived in Vancouver, and we talked about this teacher and all of us had this same experience, how we jumped out -- I jumped out of his window, I ran when he started, you know, anything. And they said they had the same experience.</p><p>And we burst out laughing, I mean it -- it's funny to us now, but we were afraid to say anything to our parents or anybody, they would think we are crazy.

Of course we knew they were in danger. The Arabs didn't love us then and they had to fight for the freedom.

He -- yes, I felt deprived of a childhood and I had sadness and sometimes it would surface when my kids said they were under pressure and I used to say, what do you know about pressure? I mean here they had -- and we wanted them -- please don't get me wrong, we wanted them to have everything we didn't have, but they lived in a beautiful home and they didn't strug -- we had provided for them and -- and they -- they had their own rooms, which I never had and -- but you know, it's normal. You can't just bring your life into their -- but at one point if they would complain they had so much pressure, I would -- then I would see that my background was with me, I -- what do you know from pressure?

I wouldn't have felt that -- that void. That was hard, especially when I was a teenager or later when I had to introduce my dates to my stepfather, who didn't -- wasn't a talker and who -- who was really [indecipherable] in my life. That was hard. And hard not having Seders and you know, I -- I'm surprised I picked up as much, cause I guess it was inborn because my -- my father trained me to be -- have such feelings, but I'm very involved with shul and it gives me comfort. But yes, I ask questions. Why and why did my husband have to die young and -- and why, but I don't feel sorry for myself, it just -- I feel sorry for those who didn't make it. Why didn't my aunt, who was only seven years older than I, she never made anything, you know. So I thank God for what I have, I'm grateful. Yes, I'm angry at the people who did these horrible things.

I'm very comfortable. However, when my husband and I joined the child survivor group and we went to a couple of meetings, both of us felt that some of the people were very bitter and they had a lot of psychological problems and they wore it on their sleeve, whereas my husband and I had gone through a lot, we just put it in the past. We were grateful for what we have here and try not to be bitter. I mean, what's the point? How you -- you survived, you're alive, you picked up the pieces. You have a beautiful family, you just speak up for the -- the ones that are less fortunate and you have to speak out when you see injustices done to -- you know, things that are done to other people, so that it doesn't happen again. Yes, my heart bleeds for Israel, I always worry. I know I'm an American, I'm a Jew, but somehow there i -- I have this special feeling for Israel that if God forbid anything would happen to Israel, you know, it -- what are we again? You know we're -- we're a people without a land.

But I'm thankful for what I have.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Got my teaching certificate and I was thrilled to get a job at Olney Elementary School where - - this was 1960. I thought I earned a lot of money, it was 7,000 a year and I was supposed to support my husband through graduate school. However in 1961 our very first child Nina was born and then in "63 her sister Sherri and 60 si -- six, Rene. And of course we were not lacking for names, unfortunately, we had lots of names to give them. Wonderful girls, we loved being parents and very proud of them. One is a psycholog -- she's industrial psychologist, one earned a degree in law, she's an attorney and -- and the third one is a -- a nurse at Hopkins, and my husband was privileged to walk two of them down the aisle with me and he was -- he did see four grandchildren, but unfortunately the oldest, when he died in "95 was only six and the youngest at the time was only two. So he -- he saw four grandchildren and four have been born since, and he would have been so proud of all of them. Just -- I regret the fact that he never was there for a Bar Mitzvah, but I -- I feel that he was there in spirit, because I can see some of the characteristics that he had in each and every one of my grandchildren. And we talk about him a lot and his -- his memory will be for a blessing and I know he"!I always be remembered. And one of his grandchildren has a love of soccer just like he did, and she's a good soccer player. So my grandchildren range in age from 20 down to two.

Then I have a Max, Maxwell David Heller and he's named after my father, David. And -- and then we have Alexis. She has other grandparents who are survivors too, so she was named after that side. And then we have Mitchell, Mitchell Heller and he was named after my late husband's brother, Baruch -- Benny. And then came Tobi, Tavulah, who is my mother, named after my mother and she was born si -- six weeks after my husband died. It was too hard to give her hi-his name. And after Tobi came Jacklyn and she has my husband's name Natanya, which is a gift from God. And then my daughter Rene has the two younger ones, she has Chelsea and Blake, who are -- unfortunately don't have Hebrew names because she married a non-Jew. And -- but I love them all and that's my mishpokhe. I am proud of all of them.</p></p></dialogue>

You know, the sadness and there was a lot of un -- [coughs] Excuse me. There was a lot of unspoken, but we had so much more in common. And there's a special bond that we all -- survivors have. So I think yes. My children also know that they're the product of survivors. They think they were brought up differently because -- well, I don't think so because I co -- I consider myself American, I -- I went through schools here, public schools, but I definitely feel like I'm a survivor. I survived the war, I feel I can survive anything. I'm also a cancer survivor, so --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You -- you started to talk about your teaching experience and then you had the children and then did you go to --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: All right. At the time when I was teaching my career ended early because I became pregnant and they didn't want pregnant women in the school system. So I decided to rear them when they were very young, myself and stay home and do with a little bit less materially. And then when I was member of Hadassah and somebody was teaching at the Chaim Weizmann Yiddish Hebrew School and they needed a music teacher and Yiddish teacher and so I said oh, it sounds</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

So I taught Yiddish music, brought me back to my music and my days in DP camp, and Hebrew and [indecipherable]. And then after my teaching there about four or five years, the principal, Frieda Frank had retired and she asked me to take over for her. I became principal and I enjoyed that very much. And as a -- a Hebrew school teacher I also went to different training session and I was trained to become a Bar and Bat Mitzvah tutor. I learned the trope for Torah and Haftorah. And I had private students. I did it for a number of my friends, they were my guinea pigs in the beginning. Friends" children that is, who are now all grown and have children beyond the Bar Mitzvah years. So I enjoyed that very much. I've also taught adult -- adults -- I've had four adult B'nai Mitzvah that I -- I trained and that was rewarding. And right now they all -- all the training I do is for my grandchildren. I've had the pleasure of -- of teaching three of -- four of actually -- five of my grandchildren, prepared them for Bar and Bat Mitzvah and I'm looking forward to the others in the future, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's wonderful.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And I -- I think it's wonderful that I belong to an egalitarian shul where we were given complete rights and I can read Torah and Haftorah, I do that in memory of -- of my parents and I chant the Haftorah and privileged to ha -- ha -- I'm happy to have the privilege to give -- to be given the opportunity where I could read Torah, because I remember we were not always egalitarian and when my mother died and I went to shul every day to say Kaddish, they didn't recognize me as part of the minyan and I fought it -- and we fought it and under our new rabbi, Rabbi Jonah Layman, he gave us full rights and I was very happy. W-We actually got those -- we were counted in the minyan before Jonah joined us and I was happy because unfortunately when my husband died and he didn't leave any male heirs and my daughters went to say</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

So I am very proud - - I don't know what my grandparents are thinking about it, but I -- I'm very happy that we have equal rights, cause they were all Orthodox.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you have any survivor friends or have you talked to survivors, other survivors who say they" ve lost their faith because of what they went through?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, my own mother really was not as pious here as she had been. She -- sh-she -- she was not Orthodox any more, she traveled on Shabbat and a -- yes, she kept kosher, definitely and -- as I do. But she was angry with God, yes, so to speak and yes I have survivor friends and we do have a special bond, have older friends and younger friends and they're -- they're like family.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What were your thoughts during the Eichmann trial?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, I was watching that and I -- I was overwhelmed by what people went through and sometimes I f -- I felt guilty that I didn't go through as much as some people and what -- what is strange, the competition sometimes bothers me among survivors. When you tell them where you're from, or what you've gone through, they say oh, that's nothing. You were not in Auschwitz or Dachau, you don't have a number. But how are they to say what I've experienced and what losses -- I've had losses. I was robbed of a childhood. And in a way that's what kept me away from some of the groups, because I was never honored -- not in my shul, my shul I've been honored many times, but never honored to light a candle, and Transnistria existed, it was a labor camp. So in a sense I felt a little hurt. I didn't make waves, but -- and a -- I've heard other people experience the same thing. People, for instance who were in Russia. My friend Ada, she also experienced that, they say, what did you go through? And you were a kid, you can't remember much. But we did.

I will always feel very, very Jewish, because no matter what, the Jews who've tried to hide that they were Jewish, you couldn't hide it. Even those who had, they say [indecipherable] whatever, even if you had a little blood, the great-great grandparents, those Germans found you and they labeled you, you were a Jew. But no, I don't mean it in that sense, I am proud of who I am. I'm proud of my people, things that we've gone through and we persevere. And that's why we exist.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, and I will never forget the very first time I was seated in the rotunda. It was an overwhelming experience, very emotional. I have taken, when we were allowed to, I have taken two of my grandchildren there and two of my daughters there. I -- I said -- it was such a -- an overwhelming emotional experience, I wanted them to experience it. Of course they experienced it differently than I did. But the first time I sat in the rotunda and suddenly I saw all the military walking in with the flags that liberated the camps, I -- I just started crying like a baby. It was a feeling of joy and a feeling of sadness and a feeling of saying well here I am, the greenhorn, sitting in the United States, a citizen, a -- in the rotunda and being with other survivors and seeing the flags and it brought back memories of the war and saying why me, why was I privileged? And especially this year it was very emotional because I sat very close to the stage and there was Elie Wiesel sitting next to our President Obama. And President Obama addressing us. I-I will never forget that, I was really choked up, it was quite an experience. And it -- it made me proud to be an American and seeing that they recognize the Holocaust. I mean, it's sad that we had it but at least it's there and -- and they recognize it by honoring the memory of the dead by having the Holocaust Museum, which is a-an educational tool and -- and I see so many people from different walks of life on line and that makes me feel good.

And so I have volunteered and I will start working at the Holocaust Museum myself. It's difficult, yes. Having been through the museum, it's -- it's ha -- very hard to take when you see very graphic pictures and when you walk into a room with pictures of smiling faces and families that were, that are no longer here because the entire town was gone, maybe a fe -- a handful of people survived, that's very hard, but it's an important lesson. And I think people should go and -- and be educated and I'm glad that they are offering it now as part of the curriculum in the schools. So I think it's my duty, it's time for me to -- to do some volunteering there as well.</p></p></dialogue>
