And -- and there was just one truck, and one vehicle after another with -- with soldiers that were -- were burned to death, you know, from our bombing, and -- and then, one night, while we were bombing, we were bombing an airfield, and we -- we came in at low level, and I remember we always had machine guns we were firing. And there was a man running. And I remember I grabbed that -- the machine gun just as tight as I could, and I was -- I was gonna kill the bastard. And so he was running, and I don't know if we hit him, or he dove into a ditch. But when we pulled off, I-- I -- I clenching -- I was still clenching my fists. And I said, what the hell are you doing? You know, I wa --I meant to kill him. I meant to kill him, and -- and that wasn't my nature. But I was -- I was determined to kill him, and not -- not only kill him, but call him a bastard. And -- and I wasn't -- I wasn't made that way.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That sound -- kind of shocked you about yourself at that moment, huh?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. And then there was another thing that happened along that line. The German army was bringing supplies down from -- from the bavar -- I mean, from the pass, and from -- there was a little town called Udinay(ph) and there was a bunch of rail lines, and it was a-- I remember it was May, and it was a beautiful Sunday. And so, it was -- but we knew that the -- the rail lines there merged, and there was a lot of boxcars full of ammunition. So we went after them.

So we photographed it again, cause we were lead, and we went back and photographed it again and bis -- it was still explosions all over the place. So when we got back to the squadron, I said, boy, we really plastered those bastards today, or we -- we got them today, and -- and so the next morning we had a briefing how many locomotives we had hit, and how many boxcars we had hit. And -- and so you felt real good, and then they finally said yeah, but 2,000 slave laborers were killed. They were in the -- and that was another thing that stuck with me, that's -- that's has always stuck with me, that here I thought something was re -- oh, that's really performed a big deed, but somebody had paid for it.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, yeah. And you know, the thing that -- the thing that convinced me to give all this stuff to you; I looked -- I -- I Googled these ca -- these camps, and there's not many photographs on them. There's no photographs, there's no [indecipherable].</p><p>So, where there's photographs, use the photographs.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's ri-- and then you have -- you have people on the -- who were on the ground, the survivors, who can say, I was in this barracks, or this barracks.

You know what -- what -- so --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Here's another quo -- quandary, though, that I've got. And that is, you first identified these photos during the Carter administration, which is, I'm saying 30 years, 35 years after the war is over. And when they were first taken, albeit it was for the I.G. Far-Farben plant, to see if that should be destroyed, did nobody recognize what these camps were? Did nobody see them?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But who -- who did -- who did they make photo interpreters out -- young people, six week course. What the hell -- what the hell did I know about Fischer-Tropsch coal distill -- distillation process? I didn't know anything about them. But I---I---I gained interest in them. And whether I'll bite into anything, I-- I won't let go.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay, I didn't understand that. I'm saying aft -- at the war, during the war itself, there were other people who were taking these photographs. You weren't in -- in that part of it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, one thing -- one thing historians didn't use fo -- aerial photos.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And yet I find out that historians make excellent photo interpreters.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oka, I was getting real good folders of women that applied for a job with the CIA. And I said, why in the hell can't I use them? So I go up in the career board, and I'd get flogged. Navy -- old navy men, and oh, I don't want -- I don't want to work with a wo -- oh God, you have to put up with her, you know, you have to [indecipherable] then you work, you train her, and then three years later she" ll -- she'll leave and she'll get married. And then when they're -- when they're in love you can't handle them [indecipherable] you know. And so I started hiring them. I got -- I got backing by the exec, cause he had been a dean of men at Dartmouth and he said, by God, we'll start hiring them. You know that 50 percent now are -- are -- of the photo interpreters are women? Simply because we made -- we made -- we made room for them. We had -- we had enough intellect, I guess, that we -- we -- we wanted women to try. And not only women, not only -- not only photo interpreters, they became supervisors. But, you know, I told them, when you come in, damn it, I don't want you to cry. You -- y-you get -- you get -- you get --I --I gotta go to career board, I don't want to hear that stuff. Not only that, but don't ask for any -- don't ask for any credit, an-and don't take crap -- crap from anybody.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="61"></span> Interview with Dino Brugioni degdeg November 13, 2014</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. No, I talked to two pilots. Nobody -- said nobody told us. Nobody told us anything was there. One -- one in South Africa, my -- I think there's a letter in the folder, I don't know, I've forgotten his name. But then, they were flying out of Fogia(ph). There were people flying out of those areas.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So in other words, they would take these aerial photographs, they would bring them back --</p></p></dialogue>

And meanwhile it was just the reverse. They were happy that I had -- I had proof that the Holocaust existed. That's -- I'll never forget Skokie.

Now she got it -- now she's got a man, she said the hell with -- Q3: I'm not supposed to be on camera, so I have to use -- Q2: Stand right in back of her.</p><p>Q3: I have to use Ina's microphone. So you and I have talked about this before, but when -- thank you -- when the photos were released, there was the reaction of, this proves what we -- this proves that this actually happened. And for a lot of people, especially Auschwitz survivors, there really weren't a lot of photos of Auschwitz taken during the war, so it really was proof that -- in-incredible proof that people could point to, it was all over the news. It also started a debate among historians, which you know, and you and I have talked about, and you've written about it, about whether or not Auschwitz, the crematoriums and gas chambers at Auschwitz could have been bombed. And you and Ina have talked about the intelligence aspects of that, how these photos weren't discovered until the 70s when you discovered them, and how at the time, the interpretation couldn't have happened.</p><p>You know, they didn't have the intelligence or the tools to analyze the photos, to be able to pin out what was the crematorium, and what was the gas chambers and do those sorts of things. But Ina was surprised to hear that Auschwitz had been bombed, and so I wanted to -- you to talk through kind of what happened when the  <span class="page-break" number="72"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Dino Brugioni " November 13, 2014 US. tried to bomb I.G. Farben, when the Auschwitz complex actually was bombed, and whether you think -- and again, I know you've written this, but I want you to say it on camera, so we have you on camera saying it; what you think the -- say, McCoy(ph) had said, yes, we should go ahead and do it. What would have happened after that? Does that make sense?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes.</p><p>Q3: Is it a fair question.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p>Q3: Okay.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Now I think -- now, I was with an outfit that we had -- we took pleasure in pinpoint bombing. We -- we knocked out bri-- we had a record for knocking out bridges, we had -- we -- we hit the battleship and cruiser. Whatever they had something [indecipherable] they -- we could hit it. And -- and medium bombers, they are much more accurate than the -- than the heavies. And I think it could have been bombed by medium. In fact, I would have volunteered on that type of mission.</p><p>You could have moved B fif-- B-25s into position and B-25s could have got them, cause it -- now, how long would it take them though to -- to reconstruct? I don't think you can reconstruct one of those killing stations in say, six weeks. They -- somebody said, well you can -- oh, we can build them in six weeks. But they said,  <span class="page-break" number="73"></span> Interview with Dino Brugioni u November 13, 2014</p><p> well, the one guy said oh yeah, well, we can't -- we can't -- we can't gas them, but we'll -- we'll u-- we'll kill them with rifles. Well, the Germans had found out that killing by -- by rifles is -- is pretty hard on the people that are doing the killing, too.</p><p>So I--I---I think it -- if--if--ifit -- if somebody said gets -- get a-- bomb it, I think the medium L-2 bombers would do it, B-25s especially. And -- and our outfit would have been a good one to do it.</p><p> Q3: Were -- were medium bombers flying over Auschwitz at the time?

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, E.J. far -- E.J. Farben -- 1.G. Farben was bombed. Is that correct?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, let me tell you, when you release your bombs, normally you have something in mind. You want to -- they call them linear. You la-- you drop them so that they -- they're pinpoint bombing in a |-long area. Or you salvo, you want them all to go one time. Now, one of the problems that they have is that when the bombs come out, when you -- when you release the bombs and they hit -- hit the airflow, they have a tendency sometime to fishbed, or sometime even to tundle -- tumble.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="74"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Dino Brugioni " November 13, 2014 And the fins are very, very li -- they're sheet -- the sheet metal, they're not heavy. So that I -- I think that what happened, either bombs got hit and tumbled and one of -- one or more -- more had hit the -- not -- didn't hit the -- what you want to hit, they hit they ark -- hit the barracks.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, I see.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see. Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>Q3: So that -- so part of the debate has always been, why wasn't Auschwitz bombed, and that's the wrong question, because Auschwitz was bombed, just by accident.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, the thing about it though, my God, you got the -- you got the stick of bombs right over the -- right over the number one and number two killing complexes.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You said that, you know, when you analyze a photograph it's based on what instructions you've gotten as to what to look for. And if you haven't gotten instructions to look for something, you won't look for it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, there was something about -- see, you had the -- the invasion was about ready to come off, okay. So the idea was wh-where do we use our resources? And  <span class="page-break" number="77"></span> Interview with Dino Brugioni * November 13, 2014</p><p> the -- we use most of our resources on V-1s and V-2 sights. General Spotz(ph) wanted the -- the synthetic fuel plants to be hit. So, you had so many photo interpreters doing work, searching for V-1 and V-2 sights that -- that they weren't looking at these synthetic fuel plants.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see. I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But I--I think the big -- biggest sin though, my God, the -- those -- all those boxcars and they -- nobody -- nobody said what the hell are these -- all these railcars, boxcars, especially during wartime? Cause boxcars are in short supply always in wartime, and not only that, but you see so many, gosh I don't know how many. I mean i -- tha -- there again, you can -- you can measure those and count how many boxcars there are, but has anybody ever counted them?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> Q3: In those photos, I don't think so. I think people have said 40.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Huh?</p><p> Q3: I think people -- the one that we have at the museum, I think it has about 40 boxcars in it.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: In-Incidentally too, you have to be a little careful there too, because in some cases -- did you see that there's some -- some vehicles next to the boxcars?
