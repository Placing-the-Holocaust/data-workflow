I got -- I got backing by the exec, cause he had been a dean of men at Dartmouth and he said, by God, we'll start hiring them. You know that 50 percent now are -- are -- of the photo interpreters are women? Simply because we made -- we made -- we made room for them. We had -- we had enough intellect, I guess, that we -- we -- we wanted women to try. And not only women, not only -- not only photo interpreters, they became supervisors. But, you know, I told them, when you come in, damn it, I don't want you to cry. You -- y-you get -- you get -- you get --I --I gotta go to career board, I don't want to hear that stuff.

And for a lot of people, especially Auschwitz survivors, there really weren't a lot of photos of Auschwitz taken during the war, so it really was proof that -- in-incredible proof that people could point to, it was all over the news. It also started a debate among historians, which you know, and you and I have talked about, and you've written about it, about whether or not Auschwitz, the crematoriums and gas chambers at Auschwitz could have been bombed. And you and Ina have talked about the intelligence aspects of that, how these photos weren't discovered until the 70s when you discovered them, and how at the time, the interpretation couldn't have happened.</p><p>You know, they didn't have the intelligence or the tools to analyze the photos, to be able to pin out what was the crematorium, and what was the gas chambers and do those sorts of things.
