<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: We are on camera. Would you tell me your full name please?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My name is Avraham L...stands for Late Bomba.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Where were you born and when?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was born in a little place. It was Germany at that time. Boyden-Oberslazen, but when I was a little kid...I don't even remember anything. My father he comes from a...a city by the name of Czestochowa. And they moved to Czestochowa. I was brought up over there. I was raised over there, went to school, and I lived over there until the last days of the liquidation of the Jewish population in Czestochowa.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell me about your childhood in Czestochowa. What was it like living there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My childhood was not a rosy one. I come from poor parents. What do you mean, poor parents? In..in Poland, I would say about 70 percent, maybe more than 70 percent of the population were poor. Poor, I mean poor. Actually, they had no food on the table. And to get a job was very, very hard, especially for the Jewish people. Jewish people were not employed by the government, not by the legislature. Their trade was tailor, shoemaker, some of them a barber, hatmaker. Even in factory, in Jewish factory where the people they owned the factory, also Jews, they didn't want to employ Jewish people. Maybe there's some reason, maybe not. Some of them they didn't want to have the sin on their own conscious because he has to work on Saturday. So the best thing for them was not to employ them. So and actually, it was very, very hard...the upbringing. In my house, my father he married off my mother. He was martried. His wife nassed awav. He had a son and a daushter. I have never seen <span class="page-break" number="0"></span> Gotta have a real trade. What's the real trade? I had a cousin of mine, he had a barber shop.</p><p>In my town, that's considered as a good trade. Was nice dressed, mixed with nice people, all kind of people they came in, and he took me in to learn. Learning time was 3 years for nothing. Alright, I got a few pennies like you call it here for tips, other things you know.</p><p>_And this I brought into the house. That was after those two kids passed away. And there was a little boy that time. It was about 3 years old. And that's how we got together. We provided for the house. My mother was...I would say not in a bad condition, because food, clothes, even had electric which for that time, it was a big thing. We had a radio in the house. You know, we didn't spend the money like the kids today, throwing it away, because every penny we maked we brought to the house, needed. And that's how we grew up until my brother got married. I myself tried to go to school. I went into a school after the hours of work and I finished it. It's one of the finest schools. And besides that I was very active in an oreanization. I was active in the Zionist oreanization..uh...called the The Richt One. <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> come. Everything was separated. The German came into the town on a Friday morning, September, the Ist, the war started. Our town was almost on the border with the German, was 4, 5 kilometers which is about 3 miles from the border. In the morning, they were already in the city. So we lived...separated. My brother was living with his wife. He had a son about 4 years old, and I was living with my mother and my younger brother and my girlfriend was with her parents. Different place! To tell you the story how it was, you know, the first thing when the...when the German came in, it was not a ball. First thing, they came in on a Friday, I mentioned it. Friday, it was quiet. At the beginning of the war, everybody start running. We did to. We ran about 40 kilometers, walking. Me, my wife...not my wife, I mean my mother, my little brother, also my girlfriend was with me. And then we decided where will we camp? The Germans were there already. So we...where we going to hang around? Decided to go back. Went back...came back to the same apartment. Monday morning, like a magic thing happened. The Germans were all over the place. Everybody out of the house. And they start dragging the men, just the men, to public places, like school, synagogue, churches and open place on the market. We were a couple of days and but seeing that stuff, shooting, killing some people, a lot of people. Matter of fact a friend of mine which was together with me in Treblinka by the name of Rappaport, Moshe. His father was killed the first one. First _____ from Czestochowa. His name was Rappaport, Lazer Rappaport... And a lot of them. We...we were over there about 3 days. They took away couple of thousand people and the rest of them they sent back home.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can you describe what you saw?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: What...what was like? I'll tell you what...excuse me. I'll tell you what was like. You come into the house. Imagine yourself. You were in my shoes. Somebody comes in without anything, without any reason. Out from the house. Not allowed to take water, not allowed to take bread...bread, not allowed to take anything. And in the street. In the street with guns, they start running after you until..-until you got to the place. I myself...they took me into a church. The church was the...the holy...the name was the Holy Family CHurch. We had a big church. We had a very big church. And we went over there in that church. They weren't...the people they couldn't get so fast in in the back of the church. They got killed in the front going in through the door. And they killed a lot of people that way. We were there. There was no food. There was no water. There was no places, you know, for the humanbeing with __.</p><p>We were over there. a priest. I'm sonna mention him. His name was He was one of <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> working there for about 4 years. And was 20 years I bought that shop. Not the money that I had. I had no money, but there was another barber which he had a little bit of money. He came in with me as a partner, and we owned that shop from I would say 37, 38 until 1942 we were partners. A very wonderful man as a partner. Very wonderful man. And that's how we lived. Every one...every barber had a quota for taking care of the Jewish people...people they worked for the government. They worked for the Judenrat, so we had a quota about a week, 30, 35 people to shave them, to cut hair without money. We did it. So we were not obligated to go dig ditches or other thing for the German. And for us that was good thing. At least we were emploved.. And we had a card that we...uh...that we are not obligated. And that what was going on until May 41. May 41, they decided to make a ghetto. So that call in the language of our town, it calls the big ghetto. Why the big ghetto? Because was many streets included in the ghetto. Also the streets were more wealthy people lived, not just the neighborhood where the poor people lived, also where... And from that ghetto nobody could leave. Nobody could go in like Catholic people. Situation was going from bad to worst. It was impossible to get along. For instance, before 1939 a loaf of bread, in Poland was a loaf of bread 5 pounds. The price of it was 50 cents. During 1941, the price of it was already 15 slotas. In my trade where the price of getting a hair cut was 50 cents, getting a shave 25 cents, the price didn't go up. Instead to get from a customer one loaf of bread, we had to do more than 15 customers for the same thing. Well, naturally was the situation was very bad.</p><p>But we lived and some kind of hope it's gonna end. One day it's gonna end. Everybody knows that, this...that. We're gonna pray. It's gonna end. It didn't end. That was going on from May 41 until September the 22nd, 1942.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you married during this time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. I got married in 1940. I got married 1940 because we couldn't go from one place to the other. Our dating...the time...we were almost 7 years together, so we decided to get married and to live together. We got married. Wasn't a marriage... marriage like they make it now, but we married off. Two years after that, my wife she got pregnant and we had a son. Was born September the 31st, 1942. That is almost 20 days...not 20...little bit...only 20 days...little over 20 days when it started the liquidation of the Jewish people in Czestochowa. But between 41 May - September 42, they took out a lot of people. They send them...they put them places, especially young people. They sent them to work which most of them did not return and it was not always in that big ghetto. But we could live with communicate also with the outside people, with the...with the Polish people. Some of them, you know, not the German...they didn't look, they looked away they didn't see it, they could bring in some stuff.</p><p>But when the liquidation started on September the 22nd, it was exactly a day after Yom Kippur in 1942. At Yom Kippur 1942, we were at the prayer house and people came in from work because people they had to work even on Yom Kippur. They said at the station, the railroad station, there is a lot of cattle trains and there are Ukrainians around. We heard the word Ukrainians, we know something it's going to happen. So the prayer was interrupted.</p><p>We seen going here and there, looking what's going to be, where we're going to go. We know already that they're going to take us away. They're going to take us somewhere.</p><p>Middle of the night, around 12, | o'clock, all of a sudden, all the lights were on, which <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> normally since 1939 was not allowed to have any light in city or in apartment and here the lights...lit lamps were on bright, shining. Four o'clock in the morning, the Germans started to take out the Jewish people. They started first the poorest neighborhood where the poor people lived. That was on September, the 23rd, 1942. I was living with my wife, my mother, mv little brother. child of mine in that noor stretch called -- which was the noorest <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> take away the Ukrainians, and the light was still on for day and night. So we know something is going to happen to us again. We didn't have to wait too long because on the 25th, 4 days after the first transport, the same thing was going on again. September, the 25th, 1942. which on the Jewish calendar was --_ aoain thev took us out. Now this time we <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> little... maybe...maybe it was over there 40 families altogether, all waiting with them. Stayed looking out the window. More things came. From other parts of the country. They went in, after about 2 hours they came out. And all the trains empty. Another train also...over 60 trains with the town people, they came in. Went in, disappeared, 2 hours came back. And now was the time our train start rolling and we went in. Gate opened up, rolled in to the camp of Treblinka. 10 men over there. We got in over there. The trains didn't go in like, you know, the first goes in. The engineer takes a train, but backwards because the engineer and the people they're working in the locomotive of the train, they shouldn't know what's going on over there. They were not supposed to...to see what is going on. That's why the pushed in the end of the train. And we went in. Out! Started yelling, "Out." It opened up. I don't know how many dead ones was a...in the train because nobody counted we had in our train. We had on out...men on the right side at the open telling... woman at the left side at the barracks.</p><p>We didn't know what it is. And we didn't believe something what's going wrong. I know something is not usually that this is the last time we see each other. My wife, the kid and my mother went in to that left side. I my...mine little brother was at that time was 13 years old.</p><p>And some of the Germans, Ukrainian and also the Jewish from the red kommando. "Take off your clothes." Took off the clothes. Start taking off the clothes. All the people did. But myself...I don't know what it happened. A man...a Jewish man which he had a band, a red band, what called a red kommando went through...he recognized someone which was near me and he said, "What are you doing here?" "You see what I'm doing here." So he said to him, "We need a few people. Go to the side." "You need more?" "Yes, need more." They took out about 16, 17 people. I was between them. Now this man which he recognized, he was married to a cousin of mine. They took out his brother-in-laws, three of them; myself; my little brother they couldn't take out because was a kid, 13 years old. And a few more stayed on the side. We didn't see. People went in through the gate. Now we know what the gate was. It was the way to the gas chamber and we have never see them again. That was the first hour we came in. After that, we...the people, 18 or 16 people...more people came in from the...working people what they worked already before in the gas chamber, we had a order to clean up the place. Now clean up the place is not something you can take it clean. It was horrible. But in 5, 10 minutes this place had to look spotless. And it looked spotless.</p><p>Like there was never nobody on the place. So the next transport when it comes in, they shouldn't see what's going on.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You were cleaning up the place?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We were cleaning up in the outside. Tell you what mean cleaning up. Taking away all the clothes to those places where the clothes were. Now, not only the clothes, all the papers, all the money, all the...the... whatever somebody had with him. And they had a lot of things with them. Pots and pans they had with them. Other things they had with them. We cleaned that up. Still didn't know what's going on until this guy with the red bands, when we asked him what's happened to them? He said, "Be happy we're here because they're finished." At night when they took us into the barrack...the barrack was near, I was just about... would say 50 meters from the gate to the gas chamber. It was at the same place where the people undressed themselves. The men undressed themselves, there was a well....just take out <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> whatever... And over there we had the barrack we went to live in. Why I mention the well, because I tell you what the well was. People they knew already, not from the beginning like from Warsaw they transport...they started on the 22nd of July 1942, so people they know already what Treblinka is. That is not a working camp. That is not a concentration camp.</p><p>That is extermination camp. From there nobody goes out alive. The minute when they came in, we find over there...took out from over there from that well, over 50 people. They jumped in. Instead to go into the gas chamber, they just jumped into the well.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Jumped into the well. I'm sorry.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The well. Yes. They drowned themselves. Took them out and that water we used to drink.</p><p>Nobody got sick. Nothing happened. At night, couldn't sleep. Some of us which were...there were religious people and they found out that their parents or their wife or their children were killed which they didn't take out...people...where they're people which they have children. Mostly they took out people 25, 26, 28 years old. Some of them they were religious and they start saying the traditional Kiddish. That was the first night I was over there. In the morning, 5 o'clock the morning, the order. Out! Went out. Stayed in line to work. What was the work? The work in Treblinka like mostly was those clothes which were there were taking away from the people the night before, they day before they killed and there was piles up on the big places with clothes. They had to be divided. Like coat to coat, shoes to shoes, shirts, and also the quality of it. A cotton, other things, wool...that was the job. We called it sort</p><p> kommando. Maybe you heard that name. Maybe not. So we worked over there. I myself I was a barber. Then at the third day or so it came...it came another order. They need barbers.</p><p>It was mine town between the 16 people they took out, there was one more barber. But I had some with me friends vou do. You're sonna he barber. Thev took also from other <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> be...because there was a line waiting to come up the next group. And that's how we worked.</p><p>Inside it was very painful. Most painful was because some of the barbers they recognized their dear ones, like wives, mothers, even grandmothers. Can you imagine that you have to cut their hair and not to tell them a word because you were not allowed. If you say a word that they going to..uh..be gassed in 5 or 7 minutes later, there would be a panic over there and they would be killed too. After that, the transport was finished.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Excuse me. I'd not to leave the gas chambers for a minute. Can you tell me a little more?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>You've talked about a friend. <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> 0 Tape #2</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You started to tell me about your barber friends who worked with you in the gas chamber.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>Would you tell me about some of them and some of the families that they met there?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was just families like any other family. But the most thing it hurts when you know people.</p><p>When a transport came in, you don't know the people. Those are people, but when it comes in somebody you associate or you are related, that's an entirely different thing. It hurts a lot more. We have..[ have friend. We worked together. We were friend in the same town together. Was a barber, a very good barber too. And he was working gas chamber with me. It happened that there came in one time his sister, one time his wife, came in his sister-in-law same thing. He start hugging and this and that. To take a half a minute more with her than with any other one. But this thing has to be done. He couldn't help himself. It was very hard.</p><p>It was very, very horrible. But any other way it was, you get killed. Which it happened. Now let me...let me tell you a story. I had a very close a friend of mine. I worked with him together for years. His name was Dorfman Slamic. Very fine gentleman. Now two men from all the time where I was over there, they didn't want to stay with us together and work together. They run into the gas chamber by themselves. He was a barber, and the other one was a neighbor of mine. He did the same thing. That's two and the history...when the history of mvself being in Treblinka _T didn't have the euts to do. I wish I could. I did not. <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> 1 and not to have a drop of milk, even a drop of water for them...what could those people do?</p><p>How could they fight? And with what? First thing, you went...somebody was lucky. He went across the gate. Got killed on the other side because he got paid from the Germans. He got paid. For each Jew he got paid a liter of vodka. That was to them and he got paid with salt.</p><p>He got paid with sugar. And even not for that time he was willing to do because to get rid of a Jew. And that is not happen to 1, a thousand, or ten thousand. It happened to lot of them.</p><p>The people they didn't go like sheep to the slaughter house. They were already willing to go the last way even to the gas chamber because their will was not decided by them. It was decided by hunger, other thing what they went through. Sicknesses, all kind. And now I want to tell you...I want to tell you about the thing...the gas chamber. Always, they ask me already about this thing. The gas chamber. How it looked? Very simple. Was all concrete. Was no windows. There was nothing in it. Beside on top of you, there was wires and it looked like, you know, the water going to come out from it. Had two doors. Steel doors. From one side and from the other side. The people went into the gas chamber from the one side. Like myself, I was in it doing the job as a barber. When it was full the gas chamber, the size of it was...1 would say 18 by 18 or 18 by 17. I didn't measure that time. Just looked like I would say I look here the room around, I wouldn't say exactly how big it is. And they pushed in as many as they could. It was not allowed to have the people standing up with their hands down because there is not enough room, but when the people raised their hand like that there was more room to each other. And on top of that they throw in kids, 2, 3, 4 years old kids on top of them. And we came out the whole thing it took I would say between 5 and 7 minutes. The door opened up, not from the side they went in but the side on the other side and from the other side the...the group...people working in Treblinka No. 2 which their job was only about dead people. They took out the corpses. Some of them dead and some of them still alive.</p><p>They dragged them to the ditches, and over there they covered them. They digged ditches and they covered them. That was the beginning of Treblinka, the time when I was there.</p><p>Later, they changed the situation over there by killing people the same way, but not take them to the ditches but to take them to be burned, to pile them on top of the other top, they burned. It was for those people... brought you the picture. Three of them, they worked only by dead people. I myself which I worked in Treblinka No. 1, was little bit easier. Why was it easier? Because we...the people working in Treblinka No. 1...1, we took in the transports living people. All living people. And from living people, we got something. We went through a pocket. We find a piece...a piece of bread. We find sometime a bottle of water which was a really...some of them they brought in other thing to eat, but over there those people they worked in Treblinka No. 2, they had no chance. All they got is naked people going in and dead people taking out from the gas chamber.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How long did you work as a barber in the gas chamber?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In the gas chamber we were working as a barber over there between 2...little more than 2 weeks. Not for 3 weeks. And then they decided that the barbers will not go in anymore to the gas chamber to cut off the hair of the woman over there, but in the undressing barracks, they divided a part...let's say like you take here, divide a part and on this side they put the same thing. Benches around and we cut the hair off, not in the gas chamber anymore. That was the <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> 2 last time...the 3...the 2 or 3 weeks we worked over there, we worked. Nobody else worked more from Barrack No. | because they did not allow it. It was a gate between Treblinka | and Treblinka 2 to the gas chamber, also with barbed wires and it was some kind like trees, other thing through the wire it shouldn't be visible.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Abe, I need to ask you, if you can, before you...before we leave and...and go to this other job because now we don't know enough. Can you tell us...during those 2 weeks you were in the gas chamber working and I know it's hard, but can you tell us about some of the other people working in the gas chamber with you. Your friends first. What...what who were they and what did they do?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They were common people like myself....growing up together. They were people I know.</p><p>They're the people I know. Like there were people from Warsaw, people from other places I never knew. We just met over there. Same like I say about those people. Some of them I don't know. And like...uh... you know, ___ I mentioned to you. I never...I never knew him. I saw him in Treblinka. So the people I knew...what kind of people they were? I'd say mostly were people...hard working people. One of them specially was a man...he was a fireman.</p><p>Matter of fact, he was related to Danny Kaye because Danny Kaye come from our place, his parents. And his name was also Daniel Kamiski which was the name of...uh...Danny Kaye.</p><p>He wasn't a barber. I took him in. He was a nice man. He was next to me standing. And they were looking for a barber and I said, "Danny, how about you." Fine. What's happening?</p><p>They go in. Because over there, he did that job. He wasn't in the eyes of the German which another thing I have to tell you. People working in Treblinka, there wasn't a job that you work, you gonna work tomorrow. Every day they changed the people they worked there. If somebody worked in Treblinka a week, he was an old worker. He was very old because he worked there, he survived a week. Mostly they did...they changed. Every day they killed 2, 3 hundred, 4 hundred people of the people they worked in Treblinka and from the transport arriving, like myself they took out, they took out other people. So they were working over there the same way. And those people that I know they worked with me as a barber. The same thev did. The same thine as I did. Thev had over there sometime their sisters <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> 3 because they have to take those things in. Now there was a question also or some did ask me, "Why did they have to cut the women's hair?" Was simple, simple answer to that. Because they needed it. What they did from that was to make saddles for the horses. Now if you cut off hair from a humanbeing, those hair it just like cutting off the feathers of a goose. If you cut the feather from a goose, when the goose is alive, that will never die. Whatever you do, you push it down, it goes up...stays up. And with human hair the same way. When you cut hair from a dead person, this hair just like the person. It's dead. But if you cut the hair from a live person, if you put in the saddle, the saddle will not push down because that was...that's why they cut their hair off. Just to be send back to German to the practice over there when they...where they make the saddles with it. Now the...while working over there...did all kind of work. At the time...let me explain the...the start of the...of the day. In the morning, 5 o'clock we had a order to get out. Get out. Went to the kitchen. Not just going forth like soldier 5 in a row to receive coffee. A little bit of black water and slice of bread. Daytime nothing. After the work, we received some kind of soup. And it was people working in the kitchen...excuse me the expression, the toilets and all the places. The hardest job and I think even harder working in the gas chamber cutting women's hair was when the transport came in and you had to take out people from the wagons. Crippled people, small children, which they lost their parents between like let's say they took one...the mother into one wagon, the children into another wagon they were not together so they were separated. But we have to take is...to take those people, the old, crippled people and the small...little small children is to the lazarette. Maybe you heard what...about the lazarette. Now lazarette usually means a hospital. Now over there wasn't a hospital. Was a big, very big ditch. And it was also with trees around. You couldn't see what was going on inside. In front of it was a man in a white thing with a red cross. It's just like going into a hospital, but going into that ditch...over there was Ukraine or German...shot in the head and into the ditch. And that was the hardest job to do. To take people, specially to have children... children a few months old...to take them in, throw them into the ditch where the...over there the fire was burning day and night at that ditch. All the thing what we find papers...all kind of thing, we threw in that ditch and that was going on as long as I was there. The fire was never off. All the time it was on. And on top of that, people and people are killed. Somebody...let's say...anytime when we couldn't go in to the latrine...to the toilet, we went to the side to do his, right away they killed. That happened to a close friend of mine. His brother's a barber. He's alive. A guy by the name of Sliska. He just stood on the side to do his...took him killed, into the ditch. And that happened all the time. Every time and all the time. Now it happened that one...one time it happened. A transport came from Ketrzyn. Ketrzyn is a little town next to Warsaw. Came a transport over there and a woman came out from that transport. Why I mention it? I'll tell you the story what it happened. That the one story which very, very seldom. She came out. In front of her was two men...two was moving with the red finger on. One of them...tall fellow about six two or six three, blond hair. Real German, but he was a Jew. And another one...his name was Solic Matter of fact, he was a barber. Well, he did a good job. What you mean a good job?</p><p>For the Germans I would say.</p></p></dialogue>

He took the people away quick into the...out from the trains.</p><p>But he didn't know they are Jewish people. He came out from the train with a razor and she cut the throat of both of them. Specially the tall fellow. I never knew his name. Was very, very handsome. He was more...looking like Germans than all the Germans together. And naturally, on the spot they killed her. Not with guns, with their shoes with anything they had, they killed her. And they took those two men into a hospital. I don't know where, but out from Treblinka. And they tried to arrest them whatever they want. This tall man they couldn't help. He died. They brought them back to Treblinka. The other one...he got killed, also broucht back. When J left Treblinka -- But the first man... that's the onlv flineral in <span class="page-break" number="11"></span> 5 "Abe, take the tablets," to me. I took the tablet. The following morning I never knew what that mean the sickness until three years ago now I got sick in Israel, also on the kidney. Now another practice. I worked in...I worked in a barrack where people were hiding. I did it myself too before I escaped from Treblinka. What was...the barrack was full of clothes...bundles maked out of clothes. So what we did we put the bundles in the barrack one on top of the other until to the roof. People they tried to escape. What they did they went in...in the day time during the work in the barracks and they remained over there. And they hid themselves between the clothes. Both it happened by accident when the clothes moved, could never go out and got choked there. At one time we took out from a barrack the size I would say maybe about 40, 60...40, 50 meters, over 30 people. Dead ones! I did the same thing when I escaped. But before that, I worked over there and I tried to help some people any way I could. At one time he came in, he was a kapo. His name was in Jewish Ben Yamin Yakoski. Have you heard that name? You did. He had a brother over there. Very, nice, religious individual boy. He was from a town of Yen Jeif, which is not far from Kielce. He came in he said. "Abe. I trust vou. Tonicht. mv neonle.. mv brother thev <span class="page-break" number="11"></span> 6 that wasn't a hard job to get. The money wasn't a hard job to get the money but to get the money was our iob. If thev find on vou one slota or one dollar. vou get killed. So about <span class="page-break" number="11"></span> 7 6 o'clock in the morning, we were at the same place. Almost a kilometer away. And we heard the Ukrainian talking, so we were in Ukrainian place surrounded. Finally, I looked through the stars and I went a different way. Went _different way, went to the River of Bug.</p><p>Stayed there until about...in the morning about 8:00, 8:30 in the morning. Met a woman not far away. She said, "What are you doing here? The Germans are all over." "Let us in for just for over a day." Nothing doing. So we stayed there...stayed there a whole day like in a wilderness around us. Then the following morning, we saw a man with his wagon and horse.</p><p>One of us went over...was a little village or something. He said it's not far away, about 6 kilometers which is not far. "Can you take us?" He said, "I'm going with my horse and wagon. If you want to go...after I don't know...I'll think about you. You go." So he went from over there and we came in. It was not a village, even smaller. Maybe was about 15, 20 families living there. And that time was...uh...the hard job started. We were liberated from that...but we were not liberated from the...from the war...from the Germans. And it start another painful, painful time. Being outside, the head man from that little village came over to us. He said, "I know who you are. I know from where you come because we only 6 kilometers from the place. We can smell. You know...when the corpse are burning, we could smell it. When the wind goes out our way. What do you want to do?" We said, "We want to go...we want to take the train to go to...back to Czestochowa. "And that's a rough time. I don't know how you're going to do it." "Okay, show us where it is the nearest station." He said, "First stay over here. Stay over night. Early in the morning, we'll see what we can do." Was a really nice man. He brought over some milk and something to eat. We left. He said, "Don't go with the way. I take you around the forest. Usually it is about 17, 18 kilometers from that place, Treblinka, to that village where he took us by the name of San Draniki. I remember every name of it. He took us over there, said goodbye. We was in the...we was also in the...in the...one night we stayed in the forest. Second night we decided to go into the village. A woman opened up the door. This friend of mine went over. "What do you want?" "We want just for the day, give us a place." So she goes in to her husband, "Go up to the stable." They had a stable. Nothing was in the stable. They were poor people. So I went in.</p><p>We stayed over there. Cold. Ice. Cold. It wasn't a stable like...stable you know, just a part was open. Wide open. WE were freezing over there. We were over there for about a week.</p><p>At night, came up and they told us to go into his house. His house was one room divided with something like this...some kind of paper . We stayed in the back. In the front there was a....his sister from Warsaw. She was a nice, young girl. And all the boys they came around, and they had a good time and we couldn't breath. We were afraid to breath. To sneeze. forset about it. And that was _ This one fellow bv the name of Berkewitz. <span class="page-break" number="12"></span> 8 them." "Come." Now this a...some kind of little story. I wrote that in a book. It is in a book.</p><p>When we came over to that one, it was magnificent. There was a man and a woman...what can I tell you. Diamonds. Didn't take money. Just for the food what we ate. And she maked the best food you can mention. We didn't sleep in the stable. We slept in the house. In a bed.</p><p>And for us we didn't see..first thing we didn't see anyone. I myself for 4 months I didn't see a woman with clothes. All I did is my job in the gas chambers. All these people were all naked without any clothing. First time I see a woman it was strange to me to see a woman. And she was so nice. Thev had a son about 9 vears. daughter 7 vears old. His name was 7 <span class="page-break" number="13"></span> 9 Tape #3</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Abe, the tape is started. We left as you were about to board a train for Czestochowa.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can you tell us about that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Before I boarded that train, I got into a family. I mentioned it before by the name of Suppel ____. We stayed there about 8, 10 days. Very, very nice people. And he had a...uh...brother- in-law. He and his brother-in-law was taking us to the railroad to pick up the train. Before we left (coughing) excuse me...their house...his wife start crying and she said, "Somebody from you survive, please write me a letter." And that was the end we saw them. We went through the forest. They went first. They didn't want to go together with us naturally. Before coming to the railroad station, from the forest under a tree...it came out a few Germans from the SS.</p><p>And how...where do you have your passports. We find out that time that the German they took away all the passports from the public to change for a different kind of passport. And we knew that. So we told them, oh, yes. Yes. It's true. "Where are you going?" "Oh, we're going to take the train." Start looking around. I was shaking. I was afraid. That's a true.</p><p>Because I didn't want to come in to their hand alive again. So my mind was to escape and let them kill me, but this cousin of mine start, you know, pushing me like coming out from a trance...my, myself...where I am. Who I am. And I didn't say a word. They let us go. Coming to the railroad station those two people, Mr. Suppel and his brother...was his brother-in-law went in to buy tickets, but the cashier at the railroad station saw us. He said, "What you want to get tickets for them. There are three of them. You are two. No, you cannot get any tickets." Why? You gotta pay money. And they came out and we told them to give them as much as as they asked for. He did give them money and we had a ticket. But luckily enough those people there didn't leave us. They went with us to Warsaw which is about 60 kilometers from there. We traveled. Even they were not allowed to travel at night, but they went with us. We arrived at Warsaw about 8 o'clock, and the train we supposed to take about quarter til 12 at night. They went over to buy for us tickets, and the cashier said, "You must be crazy. You know the law. We can't sell tickets only 25 kilometers from this place. And when you travel over there, then you buy other tickets for another 25 kilometers." And I was standing nearby and I took out a bunch of money and I put in the front of the window. "Oh," he said. "Oh. ves. Yes. IT have..uh_ all the naners from the... from the (which means <span class="page-break" number="14"></span> 0 kind of thing, but it is a wagon driven by horses, a special passenger. It took us to this place over there where he lived. Over there, we went in. Also in the hiding, it happened a friend of mine...very close of mine and ______ he recognized me. We grew up I was in the same house.</p><p>He didn't mention a word to me. He never saw me in his life like...and I never saw him. But we know it...we know we saw each other. We stayed the whole day hidden. At night through the forest, we went close to the ghetto. We came over to the ghetto. We wanted to go in and the ghetto was surrounded by Polish police, Ukraine, other kind. Was very seldom, in fact was never was somebody wants to get smuggled into the ghetto which normally people wanted to get out of the ghetto. So I went into the policeman, Polish policeman, "We want to go in." "You want to go in? You must be crazy. What for you want to go in?" We took out...I don't remember how much money. We give it. He looked away. We sneaked in...in the ghetto. Was a small ghetto. Beginning of January 1943. People in the ghetto. What can I describe to you. Very, very poor. Without clothes, without food, without anything. We got in over there. I met a friend of mine. Very close friend. We grew up together. Up til today we are the closest. He is the first one. "Abe, what are you doing here? You were sent away." "Yeo Twas sent awav. I am here."" Met a cousin of mine "Where are vou coming <span class="page-break" number="15"></span> 1 barbers worked with us. He said, "I don't know anything." He said, "Don't tell me. You know." He said, "I don't know." So he said to him, "You know something. If they could...uh...run away, if they could escape from Treblinka I don't want to bother with them. I don't know anything." And myself was a barber. I went into the barber shop of the ghetto.</p><p>Had a barber shop working over there about, I would say about 10, 12 barbers. They took me in. And I worked and I lived with them together. We ate together. Two women. One was the wife of the Balsome which he was the head man, like big leader, and the other was the wife of a partner of mine from before the war. They did the cooking, everything. At that time I had money. Naturally, I supported them with everything I could. And they had anything they wanted. We did also in that small ghetto organized like a little restaurant where people, you know, cooking, buying this that. What we did....I had a brother-in-law, and this other gentleman by the name of Eisner, he had a brother-in-law also. And they were running around almost naked without anything. What we did...we took out money and we said, "Here is aroom. You buy all kind of food you can get. So who's gonna buy? Alright. You just do with it whatever you can. Was three of us. Jacob Eisner, and this friend of mine. He just passed away not so long ago, Rappaport, Moshe Rappaport, and myself. We went down in the street. People coming from work, hungry, dirty, beaten up. We handed them money. Go up over there at the first floor. There is a restaurant. And you get food. We supplied the food and we sent them over the customers that the people shouldn't go in like without anything, and I tell you this is the honest truth. We did it as long as we could. And we're working over there. We organized also in that small ghetto some kind of resistance against...a few of us.</p><p>One was also from Treblinka by the name of Eislevich. He came from a town not far away from_Rabonska. And then it was also in January. They tried to liquidate a number of people, like to take out from five thousand, about thousand of them in to be killed. I was also on that place. That was on the market place. They took out all the Jewish people from that marketplace. They divided them in groups accordingly the place where they worked...40, 50 in a group, and took out groups and they sent them away. This friend of ours from Treblinka, Eislevich...he had a gun. I don't know how he got it. He took out the gun and he start to kill one of the Germans...the Gestapo man by the name of Ron. That was the German's name, Ron. But he didn't kill him. He didn't even want to kill him. He took apart...apart from the clothes. Because of that they took out 27 people. From the people they actually...I don't know they wanted to stay or not, but they took out a group of people...27 of them, and they killed them. Shot them in front of our eyes. And this Eislevich with their boots, with their sticks they killed him. And this friend of mine, who was also close with that Eislevich like myself. He had his knife and I had a stick and I said, "What are you going to do? Don't do it.</p><p>There will be more killing." He let it go. And I still sounds the...the voice from one of my friends bv the name of when he got killed. before he sot killed. He said to his <span class="page-break" number="16"></span> 2 the ghetto in Czestochowa. They want to know who the leader is. They took out a man, a friend of mine...very close friend of mine by the name of Poltashavichs. He was such a nice fellow, such a quiet man. They took him out to an open place and all the Jewish people around that place had to stay to look how he's beaten up almost to the end, just to say who is the leader. But he didn't say it. They killed him, and he didn't mention a word. Now, that was the last day in the ghetto. A day after, they start liquidating the small ghetto which at that time was between 4 and 5 thousand Jewish people working in four different factories in Czestochowa. One of them was by the name of Hassack _. The other one was Hosa Hassack, Bata, and there was one Slavanka where people worked. The biggest amount of neonle they worked on which was almost about 3 thousand of them. And I was <span class="page-break" number="16"></span> 3 with the people they were hidden in it. They took us to the labor camp...to the...in Czestochowa _ Over there. we worked there from the end of June 1943 until the <span class="page-break" number="16"></span> 4 just want you to come over there." I don't know. I had no feeling for it. I had no heart to do it. In my heart, even we grew up together I didn't trust him. Don't ask me why. I don't know why. And I didn't go. Now listen carefully to it. He did a lot of for some of his friends, Jewish people. He sent in food. He sent in clothes to the concentration camp where we were and he helped them a lot. After the liberation I found out a story, an unbelievable story. One of his girlfriend, which was a friend of mine. In fact she is now...she's living now. I just saw her not so long ago. He did a lot for her and for her sister and some of the family. He had a girlfriend, a Christian girlfriend. You know after going around a time with her, it happened she got pregnant. A Christian girl got pregnant. Why I'm telling you this story is she...this girl, she was with a sister. They had two sisters, Jewish sisters hidden in their house. He knew about it, but he wouldn't believe it. When he ordered her to get rid of the pregnancy and he didn't want to marry her, he went to the Gestapo and to the other...and he told them that those two sisters had hidden two girls in their bunker. They took them out and they killed them, and the two sisters...they took away. They send them to Ravensbruck. This girl got rid of the pregnancy and she was working in the Ravensbruck for a time. She was liberated. She got back to Czestochowa, and he was in the city already a big man. Everybody knew him. Nice, fine man. Nobody knew about...knows about his story. When she got back, she went to the...Polish police at that time, and she told them the story. And they called them in. "Is that this?" He said, "Yes, it's true." They jailed him, and he got 15 years in jail. After living in jail or a year, a little more than a year, he committed suicide. That's the man I didn't trust him. I didn't go to him. And something...something is luck. We had all kind of people.</p><p>We had in the ghetto even Jewish people...I don't have to tell you, if you are in this kind...they working...they were working against the Jewish people. ___ I'm sorry to say that this true. And that happened. It happened in our...in our town. We had a few men. I don't have to mention the names. If you want I could mention it. Yes? I don't think so which is very...because we are Jewish people, we shouldn't tell stories like that. But for the, you know, documentary and for the history, everything has to be open. One of them was a Rosenberg. He was a policeman. The other one was by the name of Slemmer. There were two brothers. One of them was involved. The other wasn't involved. Was a barber. Nice man.</p><p>But because he was with his brother all the time, take him also. One of them was a baker. He was head man before the war from the bakers, even he could write and read. Well, he got rich. His really name...they call him Kollibike. That's how they called him. And there were two more boys. I don't want to mention the names because their two brothers are alive, and I'm close with them. They were working against. What that mean against? They organized a group from those...one of them, the Kollibike, and that policeman, Roseberg, he worked with the German together. Announced it for the Germans, whatever was going on, who is organizing an escape, who is organizing an uprising. We find that out. And in our ghetto, we have a group of people...we took not all at one time...one everyone...a wife to a house...it was not far from my house. Over there we had lawyers, real lawyers. We had also a prosecutor.</p><p>We had judges, real judges before the war. It was a trial. They tried him for treason against the Jewish people, and we decided death penalty. And death penalty was done on the spot.</p><p>On the spot and in a bottle, wrote down the whole story, buried the bottle. And we did that with him and the other one. The other group of four people, they didn't do that. They didn't work together with the Germans, but what they did is they organized themselves a little <span class="page-break" number="17"></span> 5 group and they went in the name of the partisans to the people...Jewish people which they knew they had money, hidden money. We offered the partisan. We don't want money and this and that and in the meantime, they grabbed the money and spent the money, all kind of thine. And neonle and thev didn't like it.
