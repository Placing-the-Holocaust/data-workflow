I d--I don't remember the -- that -- the author, whatever, but anyway, we -- we were playing, the kids were playing hide and seek or something, and I -- I was with them. They started to go -- go on the loft. Well, going back to the problem what Mother was doing, making bundles of these twigs to feed the goat, it was po -- essential that you don't shake the -- the bundles, because the leaves would fall off, and the goats wouldn't get any food. So you had -- Mother make me be -- listen very carefully, and not a-allow, or t-talk to the kids, not to go and play on -- in the loft. Well, one time the kids made comments about this and that. Finally, <span class="page-break" number="60"></span> Interview with Mira Zimmerman "4 January 23, 2015</p><p> one said, oh, to the ghost, that they -- that they heard noises, whatever, like finally one of them says -- says, oh, if we ta -- say a prayer, it will all right.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So we started saying a prayer, but the boy -- I don't know which prayer it was, but anyway, they started saying a prayer, and I was saying the same ti -- prayer, but I -- I was thinking so hard, how am I going to stop all those kids going up there. Finally, I decided not -- not to say a prayer.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No ... not to say a prayer.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. This is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Danuta Soletski(ph) Urbikas, on January 23", 2015. And Danuta, I want you to tell us a little bit about how you are related to Mira, and how you have come to know about her story. So.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So, Mira and I have the same mother. My mother met my father in that whole turmoil during World War II, after he was released from the prisoner of war camp, and she and Mira were released from -- well, they escaped actually, from the labor camp. And it was in Tatishchevo, near Saratov, where was the first Polish army camp that was being gathered from all the soldiers that had remained, that hadn't been murdered in the Soviet Union. So they met there briefly, and they actually met again later on in Jelibod(ph), which was in Uzbekistan, or I don't know, it's on the border, near Tashkins(ph). Tashkins(ph) was another area where the Polish army had gone, and this is maybe 1500 miles or more away from Tatishchevo, or near Saratov.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. So I would like to -- for us to trace. | mean, some of the things that I asked Mira, she didn't remember where she wa -- you know, what the towns were, and so on. And tell me, how is it that you know all of these places?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, my mother talked about these experiences the whole time I was growing up. And they were rather in disjointed sequence. So when I had my first child, she <span class="page-break" number="63"></span> ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion Interview with Mira Zimmerman *" January 23, 2015 agreed to put it all in order, with the help of my father. And so we embarked on this project to get it in chronological order, and get the geography right, and the history. And I started writing a book about it. And I did lot of research, and you know, interviewed my parents, mostly my father, and also other historians who were aware of -- of this migration, this whole journey of these people that had been deported.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay, so I'd like to start from -- from the beginning at least, but we'll run through it, okay?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, Mira was born in Grodno, and that was in what part of Poland?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That at the time was eastern Poland. Today it is Belarus, right on the border really, with Lithuania and -- and not too far from where the current border of Poland is.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. And from Grodno, do you know what deportation they were taken on?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>Was it the February one?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The February 10" one, yes, in 1940.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. And where were they taken to?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They were taken first to a camp at -- across the Urals, which would have been technically Siberia. And I'm trying to remember the -- one was Mikelinska(ph), do you remember that name? And the other one, I am drawing a blank. <span class="page-break" number="64"></span> Interview with Mira Zimmerman "8 January 23, 2015</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But they were first there for maybe a few months, and this was in winter. And then they were taken back to another camp near Perm, which is of Molotov. And that was where they really were for the duration of the time in the -- in the labor camp.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So Perm was a pretty tough place.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The -- some of the stories that Mira shared with us today, are they ones that you are familiar with, that you had heard about before?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yes, I grew up with these stories, you know, but -- you know, these were things that were discussed, especially at -- during holiday times, or whenever our Polish friends would come over, because many of them had very similar stories, and they would start to talk about all these things. Or just Sunday dinners, you know, this was something that was so large a part of their lives. Especially my mother. You know, my father talked about it, but my mother was very -- you know, she -- she wo -- she went through so much, you know?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, if I can repeat a little bit, just to make sure that I'm clear about, she had to work as a lumberjack?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Right. She was fairly tall for a Polish person, maybe not as tall as I am, but she was, you know, generally speaking, the -- the Soviets took people who were <span class="page-break" number="65"></span> ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion Interview with Mira Zimmerman degdeg January 23, 2015 working in the country to do the harder jobs, because they were honed better. And the people who were in the cities were doing lighter work. And as Mira was saying, there was no one else f-- to work for them. It was just my mother. And so they came and assessed that she was strong enough, or whatever, to work in the forest, and she would have to go and chop off huge branches of trees that they felled, and -- and yes, there was one occasion when she -- I don't know, you know, she was so tired by then, and -- and malnourished, and just, you know, devastated by the whole experience, because for her it was a constant worry about saving Mira, that she didn't end up in one of those Soviet orphanages. And -- and so this tree was falling on her, and she just kind of stood there, and you know, they -- and watched this tree coming towards her, and at the last second she jumped into like a pile of rubble, and the -- the branches from this rubble actually cut the --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Broke the --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- broke the fall. So she -- she was in there, and they thought -- the Soviets, the brigadier, the supervisor of the -- of the work team thought she was trying to kill herself, you know. And so they got mad at her for -- for, you know, doing that.</p><p>And so eventually, actually turned out to be a good thing, because she ended up getting ga new job working -- fixing -- changing the oil on tractors, and also filling -- there was one steam tractor that she had to fill water. And she got paid more for that. But, you know, in the co -- in the course of all of that, you know, she di-- she <span class="page-break" number="66"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Mira Zimmerman " January 23, 2015 almost did end up in jail, because she was very patriotic and she would taunt the Soviets, especially the -- the locals, which were typically Ukrainians, or Byelorussian's that were the supervisors in these barracks. And she would sing Polish patriotic songs, and you know, just really -- she kind of did things that didn't help her, you know, and that's another thing that happened. So when she went to court, you know, for this minor incident, they were -- they were just -- you know, it was kind of vengeance from that particular barracks supervisor that didn't like her.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. I wanted to get a sense of how this -- how this developed, the context of such a bizarre thing, to be taken to court for, you know, having hay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Actually, there were two court incidences. One was the hay, and then there was another one where she was late for work, cause she had gotten -- like gone back to get a jacket, or something, because it was starting to rain. And that one was actually a much more serious one. But the first time I think they docked her for, I think a third of her pay, which was just astronomical because she wasn't getting paid very much anyway. It was enough to maybe buy a loaf and a half of bread a day. And so, you know, to lose that money, it was really, really difficult.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. And did you ever know, or did she ever -- was she ever told why she was deported?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Because she was a landowner. <span class="page-break" number="67"></span> ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion Interview with Mira Zimmerman " January 23, 2015</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: That's what I thought, that's what I thought.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And -- and also, I think they may have also known that her -- they were still married, even though they were separated, her husband was a -- a soldier, you know, he was sergeant in the army.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay, okay. All right, so when it comes to 1941, and there's the agreement between the Polish government in exile, and the Soviet Union to release people who had been citizens of Poland who had been deported, they learned about it from a former prisoner, rather than officials.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right, they -- the Soviets were not quick to let go of these free laborers, so it was somebody that had been let go earlier, and came back and told them about this, and so my mother had tried to get official permission to leave the camp, but they weren't -- they really did not want to give it to her, so essentially, they escaped.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So tell me, this incident what -- that Mira was talking about, where she would be a Red Cross nurse, and Mira would be left in an orphanage, was this --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, that's much later, actually.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: That's much later. Yeah, at-- when -- when my mother and sister were escaped from the labor camp, they made their way down the Volga. And this is that <span class="page-break" number="68"></span> Interview with Mira Zimmerman " January 23, 2015</p><p> incident with the little girl falling and being killed in the steamboat. And they made it to -- oh, now I'm drawing a blank. I think Kra-Krasnovodsk, you think?</p><p>A2: Kra-Krasnovodsk.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Krasnovodsk. And then they went from there, down the Caspian Sea to Pahlevi, right? Or no, actually, I'm skipping something. There was a lo -- there was -- all these people were coming off of these collective farms, or there -- you know, some of them were sent to collective farms, and more in labor camps. And there was a huge mass of people, and they na -- they didn't know where to put them. So in the southern Soviet Union, they were traveling by train back and forth, trying to find a place to -- to go. Finally they ended up getting out after that.</p><p>And in that turmoil, that's when they met my father again, okay?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So, because getting out of the Soviet Union already, things were much better by then. There was a official, the British were helping to establish these resettlement camps, and one was in Teheran, and that's where my mother and Mira were there. I'm not sure it was for as long as she says it was, but it was many months. And my mother studied nursing at that point, in English. And so, she did become a Red Cross nurse. And after that, they ended up in India, and there were there as -- as Mira said, you know, for several years, with my mother <span class="page-break" number="69"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Mira Zimmerman " January 23, 2015 being a nurse in the hospital for the orphanage, and Mira went to a convent school that was set up there, again, with British and Polish cooperation.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Now, let me go back to the Soviet Union a little bit. I want to get a sense more of the geography. So from what I understand from you're telling me, is that the camp they ended up staying in was bet -- was in Perm, the region of Perm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, the labor camp, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The labor camp. From there they escaped, and made their way to a river, where they were in a steamboat, and then went down to Krasnovodsk, is that wh-where you were saying?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They went to Tatishchevo.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tatishchevo.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Near as --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And what is Tatishchevo?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It's a city or town near Saratov.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In Russia, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And it was in Tatishchevo that they met your father --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- for the first time?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And what was his story, in brief? How did he end up there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, he was a reserve officer when the war broke out, so he was called in, and he was almost immediately captured actually, in Lithuania. And then from there he was sent --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Let me stop right there. Was he in eastern Poland?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And so how did he end up in Lithuania?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They were trying to protect the Augusta(ph) Forest canals, and -- from the Germans, and they were -- o-or no, maybe it was -- I'm not sure now. I think it was --no, it must have been the Russians that were there. And they got -- they got caught and -- and sent to an internment camp in Lithuania. And from there they were sent -- he was sent to the camp in Kozelsk.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Kozelsk.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Or -- or Kozelsk, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, there was -- hi-- at the camp where he was at, there was evidence that these officers were being sent somewhere, but they didn't know where. And he was taken, actually, to -- they were going to build an airstrip or something up further north, in the tundra, and -- at Grazovietz they were stopped, because at that point Germany had in -- attacked Poland -- I mean, Russia, and so they were camped there for a while. And then, of course, the Polish government agreed, you know, th-that -- there was the agreement with the Soviets to form this Polish army.</p><p>A2: Armestu(ph).</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: It was ca -- yeah, was --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah, an amnesty.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- the amnesty. And so then, from there, I-- somehow he -- you know, made his way towards Tatishchevo, or Saratov.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And how is it that he met Mira the first time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, the story that I heard was that she was warming herself at this stove, and my father came over, and he tried to give you some money, some rubles.</p><p>A2: Well, no, he's th -- I was holding up a box, a-- a--a matchbox of some sort.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Okay. <span class="page-break" number="72"></span> Interview with Mira Zimmerman " January 23, 2015</p><p> A2: Well anyway, in that matchbox, Mother gave me pa -- a pile of rubles, or something like that, and sh-she told me to keep it with me, in case I got lost, or -- or d-don't have anything to -- to -- that I would be able to buy some food.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see. Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> A2: And he -- he put some more of his money into the box, and gave it to me. And I refused to take it, Mother wouldn't let me take it.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: So instead of the rubles, he put some candy in there, remember?</p><p> A2: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Okay, so he put some candy in this little box, and -- and then you came back another time, trying to meet up with him to get more candy, I think, or something.</p><p>A2: Oh, I think the -- he -- he earned some soldiers [indecipherable] bought kids some sugar, and some honey.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. The soldiers always shared their rations with the civilians, especially the children. And then my father, of course, because, you know, he had daughters that were the same age. I'm sure he missed them terribly. And so Mira reminded him, you know, of them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see. And did he talk about this -- these stories as well, and this incident?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, he did, yeah, he did.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay, so when he met Mira the first time, and so on.</p></p></dialogue>

Well, as it's -- as she said, they we-were marching in formation for some kind of maneuver, and she saw him and started running up to him, and you know, he broke rank and came over, and met my mother.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Our mother.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. And then, after the meeting at Tatishchevo, you Mira, and your mom, went further south, is this it? Or you were on those trains that were going back and forth?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah, that was further south, and it was on those trains where they were trying to find a place for all these refugees coming out of the camps. And that was really, actually worse than the camps, because they were under bare skies, and it was cold. By then it was, you know, November, December of "41, and there was very little food, and my mother was -- our mother was trying to find, you know, food, and there were various incidences that were just very horrifying. It was actually much worse than the camp. But eventually they made it to another -- you know, to -- to aresettlement camp. Actually, my father sent money -- she -- they say -- I don't know how they managed to stay in mail contact, but our mother asked him for s -- help, because she really -- they were so destitute, she -- they had -- they -- their luggage was stolen, this is the -- <span class="page-break" number="74"></span> Interview with Mira Zimmerman % January 23, 2015</p><p> A2: Sh-She wrote a letter to the gi -- center office of the -- of the forming units.</p><p>She owned some scrap of torn paper, she managed to send that, and it got to your father.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And he sent an incredibly large amount of money, which I'm sure he collected from the other soldiers, of like 367 --</p><p> A2: Twenty -- 300 some --</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And it's -- 367's the number I remember. Rubles. And it arrived, it got to my mother and her. This is when she -- they were both sick.</p><p> A2: Any money se -- being sent by mail, it was a miracle we got that.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, it was -- it was quite a miracle that that money got -- and that really saved them, because they -- at that point my mother had a burlap bag for a dress, and there was no food whatsoever, and they were in some pigsty. I mean, it was just really very hard.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So it sounds like it was almost the first kindness that she had received --</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: So they made it over to -- oh, now I'm losing my train of thought here.</p><p> A2: Kovachi(ph)?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no, no, that's India.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, they -- eventually, neither one of them was going back to communist Poland, especially since one of the jobs that my father had, he was a second lieutenant, an adjutant, and hi-- one his jobs was to weed out communists from the army, and he's sent quite a few back. And his friends that ended up in England, his soldier friends, his officer friends that did go back to Poland, disappeared. So the -- the thinking was, if -- if you don't go back to communist Poland -- and of <span class="page-break" number="76"></span> Interview with Mira Zimmerman .deg January 23, 2015</p><p> course my mother and sister knew all about communism, and they weren't going back, so they -- you know, they went to England, and so did my father, after he fought in Italy, in Monte Cassino.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: He fought in Monte Cassino?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He did. And there was a -- again a -- a reli -- a resettlement camp for soldiers in Herford, and my sister and mother ended up in Coventry, and that's not too far away. And my mother decided to try to find some of the people she had met, and he being one of them, and I ge -- it was the soldiers" daily newspaper, something like that, she put an ad in there, and he answered it. And he -- at that point he -- he was in the hospital because he had a accident, and she went to visit him, and the rest is history, and here I am.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And let us know his name again?</p></p></dialogue>
