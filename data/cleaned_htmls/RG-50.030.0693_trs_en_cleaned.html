And so the company evacuated somewhere in the country, not too far, you know, one of the smaller towns outside. So I commuted there for a while, and then I stopped, and I got another job back in -- in east end. I worked there s -- it was a scientific instrument company, machine shop type of work. And well, as I said, a lot of air raids. We -- we watched -- i-in London they had -- they had a lot of balloons up, you know, to make it more difficult to get -- for the planes to get lower, difficult to have a straight run.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, maybe they interfered with the -- with their flight plans or -- or something like that. And then we se -- we saw dogfights also, you know, the -- the British planes  <span class="page-break" number="63"></span> Interview with Norman Miller deg7 April 15, 2013</p><p> attacking the German planes, and you s -- sometimes you saw them sh -- sh -- being shot down, or y -- or you -- at times you didn't know where the -- this was the English arm -- a German plane was shot down. So, there was a program where they had what they called Anderson shelters in the backyards of the building -- of -- of the houses; in the garden, they d-- they dug a hole in the ground. Then it had corrugated iron, and then some more soil on top. That's where we used to sleep at during the nights.</p></p></dialogue>

So, I lived in this place, Clapton(ph) -- you know, I used to play the che -- cello, and I want to something musical, so I bought a clarinet in a pawn shop, and -- but I had to give it up very soon, because we slept in a dormitory, you know, a whole bunch, and as soon as -- that's the only place I could practice, and you know, as soon as you try to do that, someone wants to sleep, and -- I also had a -- a --a bad experience.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What happened?</p></p></dialogue>

So I went to the director of the -- that -- the place, and he went straight to one particular person, and he had it. So, he must have had some previous record. So after a while --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did that mean you lost your savings?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, he -- he -- he had -- he had -- he had my book, you know.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="65"></span> Interview with Norman Miller degdeg April 15, 2013</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can I interrupt? At this point I want to ask, a lot of refugee kids, particularly who had been on Kindertransport, who came from Germany or Austria, sometimes were classified as enemy aliens --</p></p></dialogue>

Taylor jumped on the running board of the car, and forced the driver, who was wearing Luftwaffe uniform, to pull up. There were four men in the car, and one who spoke English said he had papers for Field Marshall Montgomery to sign. Taylor then asked a German policeman if the papers were in order and the German replied, yes. Still not satisfied, Taylor took the occupants of the car to Fusilier Miller, the interpreter and Miller immediately had them taken before the c.o. Taylor returned to his post on the bridge and a few minutes later one of the men he had arrested was marched onto the bridge again, and his photograph was taken with the c.o. and adjutant. This man was the notorious Seyss-Inquart. So thanks to the vigilance of one of our battalion's men, another war criminal was in the bag. Terrific. Let's put that in there.
