<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Her uncles did?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Also no, because they were far away from the town. Her, only had one uncle, his name was Kila Schmidt, he was an elderly man and he was a very, very intelligent man with a grey beard.</p><p>He was taken from time to time. Only when the Poles showed the Germans that there are Jews living there. Because mostly they caught the Jews when it was a very concentration where the Jews were living. So he was brought to work and they humiliated him because he was an elderly man. And I remember one time they put on him like a bottle on his back and he had to take water and carry it in the bottle. One time they took a wagon and they harnessed him to the wagon instead of the horse and he had to pull the wagon and there were a few German soldiers were sitting on the wagon and they used to hit him that he should go faster. He was an old man.</p><p>So I remember a few times when the uncle was humiliated.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And her uncle, did he live in town?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No he lived in the same house, the same place. Because they had two houses which belonged to this flourmill and the lumber yard. So they lived there and they were not thrown out yet in this time. And this house she lived with them and then when I came back I started to see her quite often, practically every day. And if she needed something I took care of it. And she lived there with the family "till June 1941, was established a ghetto in our town, so she was taken with the family to that ghetto. They got two rooms in a house in the ghetto and she lived with the two uncles, the aunts with their children in the ghetto.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You were in the ghetto too?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was in the ghetto too, so when in the ghetto, there was a different system. The Germans didn't go out and grab people, Jews from the houses in the streets to go to work, it was already organized. There was a Judenrat and the Judenrat had a list of all able-bodied Jews and they divided and they sent out cards what day each Jew had to work. This way not the same Jews should be called every day. So when it came to Rozia's time so she was notified and she went to work like other Jews went to work, cleaning houses by Germans, cleaning the streets, throwing away snow in the winter. She did all kinds of work the same way.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Let me just check this.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: O,K. Then we lived like this in the ghetto and then later I was taken away from the ghetto.</p><p>This was in January "42 which was already bad because every time the situation got worse so I had a mastoid, a middle ear infection, and they had to smuggle me out from the ghetto so she had to go with me with my younger sister to the hospital. But the day we had to go by sled in the very deep winter high snow, so she had trouble with her tonsils, she had high temperature, so she didn't go. But when I was in the hospital and I was operated, about two weeks later she came to this town to the big town, somehow she got a pass because you couldn't travel by train, you couldn't go out from the ghetto. We were in the ghetto. So she got a pass and she came to</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You got sick with an ear infection and you were sent to Tarnov. I wasn't sent. I was with an ear infection over four weeks. Instead to take care, we didn't have nobody to take care and it got worse and worse until the whole pus went already to the brain and then we saw that there is no way. I was practically dead. So with a sled they took me out of the ghetto to ,toa bigger town and we came to and we came to , to a doctor, there was a <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection already so far, the gates were closed and April 28, the Gestapo came in, they shot my father, they shot this time 22 Jews, and they had a list of 22 Jews and my father was between them and then later everything went down, every day was worse, there were killings and killings and killings. Until June the 20" we were chased out from our ghetto, from Kollupzowa, to a larger ghetto, to and in vee <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection saw we had nothing left. After a few months, and the end of November, we escaped into the woods and this is how I survived. Otherwise we would be taken to Belzec the same thing as all the people, because they accumulated in Rzeszow about hundred thousand Jews from all towns who surround Rzeszow. Because what they want to do is they want to have the Jews in one place where there is a railroad station. Now they told the Jews that they can take along with them anything they want. So this is what they wanted, the Jews should bring over everything and later when they took them away to Belzec all their stuff was left in the town in the ghetto and the Germans had it in one place.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In Rzeszow?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In Rzeszow and they later took it to their warehouses and the things that they needed they took away and the rest they gave to Poles. The other thing I wanted to mention about Rozia, when we Saw it starting to be bad, this was before I went to the hospital. You see I had a younger sister, my younger sister, and she was very pretty, she was very intelligent. She spoke a few languages. She spoke English, she spoke German, she spoke Hebrew, Polish.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was this Rachel?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Rachel. And Rachel was only three years older than I was so we tried to arrange, Rachel should escape because there was a man, a Polish family who were thrown out from their houses, from their town in Pozna. Pozna was a town that it was next to the German Reich. This was from western border in Poland and they came to our town and they opened a little store in our town in the beginning of the war, and became very friendly. And they had a son a little older than I was, about five years older, and we became very friendly. So he begged my mother and Rachel, they would move away from our town to a different town and they would make believe that her son is a husband of Rachel, that Rachel is a daughter-in-law, in this way she would be able to survive with them. When they told us this, we thought it's a very good idea and then I came to Rozia and she looked Jewish whatsoever, she looked so typical Aryan. She had blue-greenish eyes and she had gold hair and she didn't look at all Jewish. So I told her, let's make arrangements because Rachel is going to run away with this family and you will go with them and we will make up somehow papers that you are a sister. We'll make false papers, it means that she's married to this Pole and you will go away with them. We talked and talked and she somehow was afraid. She said, I cannot take a chance. I am afraid. I do not have guts to do it.</p><p>She said, my sister Rachel could do it because you are so capable, she admired Rachel, and you can do it. So Rachel didn't want to go because she didn't want to leave the family. And Rozia was afraid, she was afraid. Maybe if she wouldn't be afraid maybe Rachel would somehow leave the family and go. Well, once we told them this, my sister Rachel had another chance to be saved. When the ghetto was established, they brought into our town Arbeits Amt. Arbeits Amt means a German labor office to register all the working people and the head of it was a German, and they needed somebody to be his secretary who spoke fluently German and could write German. My sister spoke beautiful German. So the Judenrat assigned my sister to be his secretary, and she worked with him. They became very friendly. He liked her very much. She was a very nice person, and when the Jews were chased out of our ghetto to Rzeszow, naturally this Arbeits Ant didn't exist any more. So in Rzeszow, in the ghetto, somehow on the street he met my sister, he was very happy, he said, you know what I am transferred from Rzeszow and I am now the head of the Arbeits Amt in Rzeszow and I need a secretary. Why don't you become again my secretary and I will give you a permit to stay here and you will not be taken away. So she said she would remain if he will give a pass to my other sisters and to my mother. My</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection father was already shot. He said well I can only save you not the other ones. So she didn't want. So sometimes the closeness of the family, the attachment to the family sometimes it was a curse for the Jews. Because a lot f Jews could be saved, they could save themselves to run away, or do something, but they wouldn't do it because they didn't want to leave their families, their fathers, their mothers, their sisters and brothers. So this time she didn't want to go away if he wouldn't give the permit to them to be left. So we're talking about, we went away a little from Rozia, but this is how she perished.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did you find out about Rozia's family in Russia?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well when I went to Russia, when I escaped to Russia, I knew that they are there. So we went to Lemberg, Lvov. In Lemberg everybody from each town knew about somebody else who was there. So we got acquainted.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And later, after the war?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: After the war they were in Siberia and during the war before Germany attacked Russia they used to send cards to Rozia from Siberia. So we answered them a letters. Then after the liberation they were liberated, somehow they sent a card to Rozia to Kollupzowa and they wanted to find out what happened to them, if they are in this time in because they were released from the . And they wrote a letter, so I got the address. I wasn't in Kollupzowa, <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection closer to Rozia. Also he used to tell stories. He was a philosopher. So sometimes he caught me with my friends, he used to tell is stories about philosophy. Nobody wanted to listen. I always was standing there listening to him because again the same stories. But special about Rozia, yes, also this may be interesting. After when I came back and I was not anymore Hassidic and I started to see Rozia, we joined the Hanoar Hotzioni, this is a youth, Israeli Zionist organization.</p><p>And I was very happy that we joined, because she joined at this time together and then later my sister Rachel, was the head of this group in our town and then later when I wasn't anymore Hassidic, I took over and I became the head of this organization. And we got together and we sang songs, we started Hebrew and we went out on outings and then already this was one of my happiest days because in this group, Rozia also belonged to the same organization until the war broke out. So that's all that I can tell you about is the times that we belonged to the organization.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How long did she belong to the youth movement?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: To the youth movement she belonged from, I would say, about two years, a year and a half, two years. I would say deg38 and half "39. And then the war started. Then in 1939 I wanted to go to Palestine, but I couldn't so I made contact to go to Palestine illegal. You paid in 500 zlotys and they took you to Romania and from Romania, illegal on a ship to Palestine. So I remember with a friend of mine I paid in the 500 zlotys to go, he didn't have the money so I remember his mother sold two candlesticks and some pearls for him to have the money. We sent in the money and we waited any day to go. We got letters and then we didn't go because the war broke out.</p><p>And during all this time we made arrangements that if I would go to Palestine the first thing I would see to make arrangements for Rozia to come over.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: She wanted to go?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: She wanted to go, yes. Well this was everything quietly. I didn't tell it to my family, she didn't tell it to her family. But between us we made plans to go and to settle in Palestine. Also, in the beginning of the war there was a German company had the ad in the paper that if somebody wants to go to America and if they have family, we can register and we would be able to go to America. And this was during the war. You had to send in so much money to be registered but you had to have blood relations. Yes, I had a brother, so I remember my sister Rachel, registered and I registered with Rozia and I registered that we were married, because we said in case this will come and it will be actual ready, so we would be married and we will go. So we sent in some money and later we didn't hear anything about it. So my sister, Rachel, had a Chusen (?), so he came to America a week before the war broke out and he came and she didn't come. She could come before but she waited for him. Listen, you only need half a page, but I don't know what you would pick out.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I think that's fine and ["ll call you if I have questions.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: All right, if you have it, or you can send me a copy.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Sure.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You can send me a copy by normal mail. You can send it and I will correct it or something and then later I will correct it and I'll send it back.</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, I just want to ask one or two more things. Maybe you can describe to me where Rozia lived, maybe the house she lived in.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: O.K. They lived, mostly Jews lived in the town. Mostly Jews lived around the market place and the market place all houses were Jewish. Only four houses in the market place, which was very big, were no Jewish and all the Jews had the businesses and the rest of the Jews were not rich, were very poor lived around the synagogue. They were small crooked houses, old houses falling down. Rozia lived I would say about half a mile or maybe a kilometer, no about a mile out of town on the road to go to Rzeszow. And they lived there and they had two houses. Three families had two houses. There was a brother and two sisters. Her parents. Her mother had a sister and a brother and they were all in the business. In the business before the war and they lived in those houses. They were nice houses. It's not comparison like we have in America because there was no running water and there was no indoor plumbing. But the houses were nice with beautiful gardens with flowers. Now one of the sisters of her mother, her name was Mrs. Smith, she was very particular in her garden. She always worked, with beautiful flowers and every time there was a concourse, it was how you say, to judge which flowers, a contest, her flowers were the nicest. She didn't have children so she had the flowers. So they lived there, like I said. The only thing they had more than we in the town, we didn't have electricity, they had electricity. The reason why is because they had electricity from the mills because they had there the generators, so they had electricity for themselves. So for us it was something important because when we come we saw electricity. They had very beautiful homes, very nicely furnished. But for our town it was nice. But it was lacking water and indoor plumbing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was the mill fairly successful?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was successful, but later it fell down because in the beginning of the "30s it was a fire, there was a big fire in the mill and they somehow could never recuperate, they could never build themselves up as it was before the fire. So it was not so big, it was a small flourmill and a small lumber mill, it was not big. It wasn't that they manufactured to send out for export like other mills, it was mostly for domestic use. Peasants needed to have flour brought over some grain but it was not successful after the fire, it was not successful. But it was a very prominent family.</p><p>They were a little more modern than the majority people in our town. The majority people were very orthodox and they were already a little more progressive, like you could see like Rozia's sister and brother already went to gymnasia, my sisters didn't go because my father would never allow us to go on a Saturday. Rozia didn't go anymore to the gymnasia but her brothers went. The reason Rozia didn't go to the gymnasia because this was after the fire and probably this was quite expensive because it was a private gymnasia, private high school, and probably it was too expensive for them to send Rozia to the gymnasia. So instead of the gymnasia, so after she finished the she went to a seamstress to learn how to sew. <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection see I know all those stories, I don't know what else I can tell you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I think that's good.. So they were sewing like dresses?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, mostly they were sewing to order. If somebody wanted to have elegant nice dress, but they didn't sew dresses to sell or something, this was only to people from the town would come.</p><p>Not the average person because average person went to somebody who was cheaper, but somebody who wanted to have a very elegant dress, a very elegant suit, women, so they came to her. Because her being already having already a workshop in Vienna, she was a little more sophisticated. And then Rozia after the war and before the war she was very capable. She did all her dresses herself. She was very good at it and then later when her sister left for Russia, so she left all her clothing with her because they wouldn't take away, so later she fixed them over to fit for Rozia. And then later when she needed to eat, so she started to sell little by little what her sister left in the house.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So in the ghetto she had things from her family to sell?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: She had things from her family to sell, yes. But she was by herself, so she ate with her uncle.</p><p>With her uncle who didn't have no children and how they lived, they lived together. I know I used to travel a lot and I used to go out in the ghetto, I took off always my armband, because I didn't look Jewish. So I used to go out and I used to bring in a lot of food to the ghetto. So every time they needed something, so I brought it for them. This is how we went along. If the Germans wouldn't have a total destruction, a lot of people could survive. You see Rozia had the big chance because she looked so much gentile and she spoke so good Polish. Because her language actually was Polish. They didn't speak home Yiddish like the majority. The majority Jews did. Like for instance, in my home we spoke Yiddish, but nevertheless my sister spoke Polish. I spoke a good Polish because we spoke Polish in the business, in the store with the non-Polish population and my father was practically the only Jew with the long grey beard who spoke beautiful Polish. But the majority people in our town didn't speak good Polish. But Rozia's family spoke only Polish.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did Rozia speak Yiddish?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Very bad. She spoke always, I remember, when she came to us and sometimes she spoke to my father, so my father laughed and she always, well you speak Yiddish like a shiksa. She spoke very bad. She spoke German. Everybody by us in our section spoke German because our section was Galicia and this belonged to Austria until the end of the First World War. So everybody spoke Polish, I mean German. But Yiddish, she didn't speak. She understood, but..</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So when you two spoke it was in Polish?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was in Polish, yes. And I remember even when she came to our house so my sisters, my mother spoke to her in Polish. And late when she came to our house when we were in the ghetto and there were certain times that I brought over things that you couldn't get in the ghetto, salami, a piece of cheese. All I remember my brother in America sent through turkey, a package with chocolate, with salami with other goodies that you couldn't get in the ghetto, and I would divide it for all the children. When she made little pieces, she always included Rozia. She said it was for her, she got also a part. I remember it was Rozia's birthday and I wanted to give her a present and I there was nothing to sell in the time of the war and my sister had a beautiful</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

It was with initials R.S. so she gave it to me I should give it to Rozia. My sister was Rachel Saleschutz and Rozia was Rozia Shiskin, and she said give it to Rozia. Then later she said to me, well maybe I shouldn't give it to you because this gift didn't work out good for her, but nevertheless she gave it to me and I gave it to Rozia. You see, we were very close and I was the youngest in the family and if I wanted something it was all right with the family. See her family was different from my family. My family was more Hassidic, ultra, ultra orthodox and their family was modern. So this was a little bad, but later it didn't make no difference. It so happens that her brother, now in America, he's very religious. He goes every day to shul. I don't go. I go once a year. You know, it changed those things. You don't always have the same thing.</p></p></dialogue>
