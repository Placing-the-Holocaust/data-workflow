I lived, for the first year, somewhere on the ci-- in the city.</p><p>And when I was a year, or a year and a half, we moved to the part close to Palac Branitsky, is Palace of Branitsky.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And where's that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I-In there, on part, they were divided, so there was a fence between the one park and the other.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They didn't have anything farther than that. So my mother was specialized in teaching the teachers, and because of that, she was teaching e-even in high school, the 10" and 11" -- well, 13 grade. At that time the teacher, after 12 of the 13 grade.</p><p>Otherwise, she has only the right to teach up to the ninth -- sixth grade, sorry. The school was divided six grades, four grades and two top, and then you have the high school.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So your mother was a teacher. Was your father also a teacher?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In 1920.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because he -- in 1920, he was 22. So most likely he was in the army. They never talk about that. The only thing my mother convince him to leave the army. And because he was in the army before, he was the army reserve. So from time to time he had to go and learn a bit more for a week or two. Otherwise, he was a clerk. A -- most likely he was an accountant. I didn't know much about it.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Mm-hm. The buildings were built -- when I visit after the war, the walls were most likely close to a meter wide. So it was always warm, but of course for the restroom we would have to go -- share it with two other families and go downstairs somewhere. There was no hot water, and things like that, because the building at that time was already 150 years old.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Before the war. They were going to put it into underground. What they did afterwards, I don't know. I visited Bialystok only once from this country, and it was completely different. Before the war, it was 104,000 people. And apparently half of the population was Jewish. I thought it only about a third. Part of the poorest part was Jewish, and they were all -- also little shacks where they were selling every -- food and everything, so we would go there. And I'm sure that it was completely burned while eur -- when the Jewish people were fighting.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Vocational school.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Pedagogical, okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, and those teachers had to learn on us. And since in the country there were big classes -- usually, I think, in Poland were, in cities it will be 30 in class. But in ours it was 40, and once I was in a connected school, connected class, third and fourth grade together, 60 kids all together, so the teacher would learn how to do it.</p><p>Only one year like that. So, there were big classes. And out of our 40, there were  <span class="page-break" number="17"></span> Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014</p><p> three children who had the option -- there was Catholic religion I think twice a week for an hour -- they could stay, or they could go out. That was not discrimination, they a -- all -- all the children were very, very glad to leave and do whatever they want.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Not have to be -- yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, that was definitely not discrimination, they could stay and learn. Our -- for instance, we start with the prayer. They would not have to pray with us, only they have to stand up on the very beginning and the very end of the school. But they would have to pass religion to pass to the next grade. So --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Their own religion?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Their own religion. So the rabbi has to say that they passed the religion for the, say second grade, before they will go to the third. But what they learn, that was his only. He did not have to say what he consider good for the second grade.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you're saying this was true for the Orthodox children as well?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. And were there many Orthodox children?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In my class, only one.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And that brings me to another question. You mentioned that you thought that the Jewish population of Bialystok was maybe 30 percent, but after -- truly afterwards  <span class="page-break" number="18"></span> Interview with Barbara Syska " October 22, 2014</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't know. But there was a joke after the Russians came in, that people used to say when they were in White Russia or Ukraine -- we call it White Russia --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You're talking Belarus?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I can't pronounce it properly. They used to say that we're local, we're local. And they say afterwards that Polish people wanted -- for 20 years wanted to make them Polish and they didn't, but the Russians came and did it in two weeks.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, there is something to that, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I remember from learning about the region around Wilno, the people would say the same thing. Who are you? And they wouldn't say I am Polish or I'm Lithuanian or I'm Russian.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I'm local.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, because it was under Russia, Poland doesn't exist for 150 years, and they felt Polish, so --</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Kind of Polish.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And don't -- don't treat people the same ways. So -- so, they were local.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: They were local. So let's talk a little bit more about religion, a little bit. Was your family religious?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My parents were not. They treat -- well, I think that the -- the problem was that they believed in regulation of birth, and that's against the ga -- Catholic church.</p><p>[indecipherable]</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, so they believed in birth control.</p></p></dialogue>

I believe that was the reason, but I don't know. But they kept us, we were going to -- to church every Sunday, and -- and well, th-they try not to talk about that, but because of they believe in bir-birth control, they didn't try to go to church and pretend that they are good Catholics.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see. But you were -- you, nevertheless, would ha -- take religion classes in school, and did you go through the various stages of, you know, having a First Communion and a Confirmation, and things like that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, yes. There is only one thing. My mother told me that once a woman came to her and said, I don't want my child to be in a religion class. And my mother said, what -- well, I'm an athe -- atheist. So all through those years my mother was [indecipherable] something. There was one atheist.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And of course her child, who would not go to religion class because that was -- only she could not provide a certificate of any religion that he passed. So he was not learning.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really? Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: But one in years.

And he lived with us, he came to United States, he lived with us for a week or two. And right now, if he's alive, he's still teaching in an-- Ann Arbor. But that came, that one year everything was -- was bad, it was supposed to be bad because of Jewish people. And I think something was bad, people can't take very easily. So most likely right now there is the real anti- Semitism in part of Poland, not to everybody.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: But it was definitely -- I -- I want to give you what was before the war.

That -- those were extremists, but hardly ever. And so that was not showing what the population was. But we have, don't buy in Jewish store. Last few years we e -- if we could avoid. And the reason was economic, because before Poland received independence into ninet -- 18 -- Jewish people were taking part of commerce. Because for a nobleman it was not nice, so if he brings some food, somebody had to bring into the city. And that was what Jewish people were doing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Then [indecipherable] Jewish population was very |-large. Out of 30 millions -- no, 33 million people we had before the war, three million were Jewish. Because when in the western Europe in, I don't know, 15" 16" century, when there were a fight and they didn't wan -- like Jewish people, Jewish people came, and apparently just past the e-e-eastern border of Poland there was a biggest population o-of Jewish people, because we accepted them. So that was only when Poland get the independence, and we started to modern life, somebody had to have the -- the shopkeepers could not be only Jewish people. And because of that, Jewish people were fighting the new stores. Of course, that was economic fight. The whole part of was -- some Jewish people were giving money to this storekeeper who was next to the new Polish store -- not Polish, Christian store. Jewish people were Polish people.</p><p>But they were giving him money, so Jewish store had everything cheaper.

But --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I want to -- I-- I want to go to -- I understand what you are explaining, but I would like to -- I would like to focus on, did this play out in your life at all?

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, for 12 -- 12 years, there were two or three. The first one was the one which worked with my mother, providing lunches to people.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I live in place where there's a lot of Jewish people. But, for instance, I knew tha --and I always wonder wha -- from me to the closest synagogue is more that 1,000 paces. And I learned that Jewish people cannot walk farther than 10,000 paces. So how can stretch it? They don't drive, of course. They go -- walk to synagogue. But I knew about that. I knew about matzah.</p></p></dialogue>

So, we knew a little bit of the Jewish culture. And of course, my parents were very much against us. That was just before the war, there were some people who were against Jews very strongly, and my parents were saying that it's -- it was completely silly. When we had to, during the war, under the Russian occupation, we had to go to Warsaw, to German -- Germany [indecipherable]. So, my mother went to a friend who was a doctor, and she gave my mother a sign that my mother has a weak -- weak heart, and have to stay at home for three weeks. That was in case we would not be able to pass through Warsaw, and she would have to come back, so she will be able to get her job again. Of course, that was something what she -- it was be punished by whatever, maybe sending to Siberia. But she gave it to my mother.

I think it was volunteer everywhere, that m-maybe there was pressure on women, but definitely not pressure on the -- physical pressure. No, not physical pressure, psychological pressure.

So that was something what to occupy me, when we didn't had any pers -- anything, we learn history. I started to learn -- I-I started to learn English before that, but we had one book. It was [indecipherable] something like that, it -- a some book on lowest level, about some murder or something like that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Like a detective novel or something?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: M-Most likely detective novel. But the three girls who we-were learning from somebody who knew that, were on much better progress, so I was learning what is here, there, at, and things like that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So they were learning English from the detective novel?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes, because we had that detective novel. And it's still -- in Sandbostel we used to walk up and down the corridor there. There we were in such a crowd that when we were sleeping on the floor, if we want to turn around, everybody would have to turn around. But there was a corridor on which we could not walk during the night, but during the day. And I and two other girls who were learning English -- English was not popular in before the war, only French and German. Russian, we had to learn later, but wasn't popular. But anyway, so we were talking the whole Polish sentence with one word English which we knew, not to forget. But then in Oberlangen it was already something like that.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And in my camp, I learned later that bo-both went to Israel. We knew they were Jewish, we can hear a Jewish accent. It's a some sort of accent, I don't know whether I would be able to recognize right now. Jewish people had that accent, and the best educated had the best Polish, no accent at all. You hear the much better pronunciation that others. But the just ordinary people had some sort of accent which we could recognize. They definitely had, and the older one looked like Jewish girl. So -- with the f-face. Nobody ever mentioned that they were Jewish, of course, because we never knew whether they -- even as prisoner of war, whether they would not be taken out. And I was talking to that little one. I think that she was about 10. Apparently, she joined the insurrection, and was a messenger, as I was.</p><p>And she said her biggest trouble was that when she was sent with messages to people [indecipherable] somewhere in there, and she should not ask people where to go if she mistake it.

She would never know who is that person. So, what she did before, for that year, I don't know. Maybe she was singing in the streetcars, or so on. There were some songs against Germans, which the -- the streetcars were so crowded, and nobody would s -- would [indecipherable] anything. What they did before, I did not ask. And apparently -- I don't think that she would be alone with her sister. I don't know whether it was her sister, they used the same name, last name. But they were so different. One was -- my little hero was blonde, and the other one was dark. Everybody liked the little one, we didn't like very much the other one. They completely different.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. In the early days I have had some other people say there were streetcars that would go through, and so they could take the streetcar in. But that was in the early days of the ghetto.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: There was small ghetto and big ghetto.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't remember next to Zelazna where I was walking, whether that was big or little one, right. And in between there was a street, so you could see it, and people could go from one ghetto to another over that. And that was -- now, one of them, the one which was farther away from me, started to fight a few days earlier, I don't remember. And then I was walking -- we were shocked [indecipherable] we knew that they cannot survive, nothing will -- there was a Polish underground and Jewish underground, there were some connection, but we didn't have a lot of ammunition or anything, even for -- for our-ourselves, so we didn't have later. So we couldn't help, we just had to look helplessly. And we were sorry, looking at -- at people who were dying there. But on the very beginning, on that -- that other ghetto, other part was fighting and this one not. When I was going through Zelazna street, and over that big wall, I could see a woman -- it was April, it was warm enough, she was looking through the window down there. They were not fighting. And she was  <span class="page-break" number="98"></span> </p><p> 102 Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 maybe even smiling. She was definitely not -- not horrified, not frightened. She was talking to somebody with -- it couldn't -- you couldn't say joy, I-- I don't have the word for that. But I was horrified. How could she be so calm, when she is going to die pretty soon? Where her people are dying? It took me a few years to understand that she was proud. She knew what's waiting for her, and Is -- I still can see her how it was, and she took it nicely. She was glad that -- that they fighting and not -- not allowing to be martyred by -- by themselves. It -- it give me a -- an impression, because we were horrified.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That image has stayed with you.</p></p></dialogue>

There was streetcar, and he said, don't go by streetcar today, not this one, because Germans put -- hung some people and so high, so you could see it from streetcar, and there were dead people there.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Which prison was it? There's a Pawiak prison, I remember.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, no, Pawiak, he was somewhere else.

<dialogue class=""><p>That is that --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: On the very beginning, we didn't. I knew quite a lot because of my father pretty high position in -- in the army. So, for instance, when Russians were coming and are close to Wilno, people were saying we're Armia Kryova. At first they were treated nicely, but then they were prison there, something. So, before the insurrection, we knew already what was really expecting us, that unless we'll be strong enough to get Warsaw before the Russians would come in, but they stop, and they didn't want the allies to -- to come in London, whatever, once more they --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="100"></span> 104</p><p> Interview with Barbara Syska</p><p> October 22, 2014</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- they did whatever they --</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Maybe later we knew. On the very beginning, nobody knows. When ghetto was starting, some couple which were Christian and Russian -- and Jewish, they could choose the -- at least the wife could stay outside.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- because nobody expected that. They expected that people will be separated, but not that. Later they knew and most likely we know. But for quite a time Jewish people didn't know that when there is a transport, the transport is to be killed.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So did you know the na -- did the -- did the terms Auschwitz mean something in 1942 and 1943? Did the term Treblinka mean something?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because we -- we knew that German want to kill all the Jewish people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So you did know that. You did know that there was -- there was --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: But not on the very beginning.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: On the very beginning we didn't.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you ever, or did your father ever see any Jews being taken from the ghetto to the train station for such a transport?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So during the war I was not involved with any Jewish peop -- person trying to get away, or anything like that.

If you say the name I will tell you that, yes. But -- so we know that there is a underground there, but we knew that everybody is helpless. The -- our insurrection was prepared for three days only, because we didn't have the ammunition for everything.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Oh, so when you were telling me about three days, it -- and it ended up being 63 days --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's what you were explaining. Got it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. Some was taken from Germans, some was -- but very little from the -- being thrown by allies, but not Russians. The Russians, on the very end, helped and they s -- threw some bread, I had some bread.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh really? Some bread?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. Completely dry.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We were hungry, but it was the ammunition which we needed. And they did not let the allies planes land on their side. And because of that there was a lot of people lost because of that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So, were -- were --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Russians stopped, because they wanted us to be killed.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: The --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And had the -- and were the insurrections, the people from the uprising, were they expecting the Russians to come over the -- and help out?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Definitely, because they were our allies. We were not in good -- in terms with -- with them, because of Katyn, and that time only Katyn, not -- not the other camps.</p><p>So it was broken without us, but I think [indecipherable] went to see Stalin just before that, and Stalin didn't say anything. And no di -- they were definitely wanted us to -- to be killed off.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So tell me a little bit -- I'd like to get a sense of how -- by the time the news about Katyn was revealed, when the Germans found the site of the massacre of the 4,000 Polish soldiers -- Polish military men, were you already in Warsaw?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was in Warsaw, I don't remember when it was.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember learning about Katyn in -- while you were in Warsaw?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="104"></span>  108 Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Straightaway, because we knew. The Germans allowed the Polish Red Cross, because they wanted everybody to know what Russians did.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: So, there was all the news we knew, and since people were killed in -- with their all uniform, there were some papers and things like that, so --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So they had identification with them.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Identification. We had not di-- doubts that it was the Russians who did it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And were you working at the Red Cross when this news came in, or was this before that time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think it was later, could have been later. I don't remember when it was.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. And you mentioned to me earlier when we were not taping, that your father recognized some names. Can you tell me about that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: First of all, the -- he was the first one to sign that he wants to come back to his family. And --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: That's when he's still in Lithuania.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In Lithuania.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And then the first transport went out, and he was not on that, so he went back to, most likely the camp -- Polish people in the camp, who signed him, and he said,  <span class="page-break" number="105"></span>  109 Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 why not I should be? And then in the third one, I'm sure that he knew the names, because there was a ter -- transport from there. I think that Katyn was not only from his camp, but from the others as well.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Course.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't know. I don't know what the name of his camp was, but definitely he was in the second transport, not the first one.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay, and so when -- when you learned about Katyn --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: We knew what it was.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yes --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Only then we learned, because we -- before that we didn't know.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did he recognize some of the names of the people?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, he did.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see. So when he -- when the identification list was made, he recognized that some of these people had been in this camp with him?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, because he would not know that the -- there was a thir -- third transport.</p><p>They could be from everywhere, but he recognized it -- he knew that third one went there as well.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see, I see. So there was no -- no doubt in your minds that this was not just German propaganda, this was actually true.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And recognize. And there were letters and [indecipherable]. Yes, we knew.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So let's go back to Oberlangen, where you are, you know, you're -- you're there with about 2,000 other women, prisoners of war, and it's now like the winter of 1945, the war is coming to an end. Did people in the camp n -- have that feeling that it's not going to be a lot -- long now before it's all over?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, we believe that. And it was funny incidents, there were people in Polish army under British command, and they stopped not close to our camp, and Germans ask, why do you stop here for the night? Why your women are there? Because Germans knew. And so they went. I think we were rescued about five or six o'clock in the afternoon, because they did not know that there was camps.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you were liberated by Polish forces?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Polish forces, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, that must have been something.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And that was before the end of the war, about a month, I think about a month. It was April.</p></p></dialogue>

The Anders" Army was mainly from Siberia, but also quite a lot of people came who were taken to German army, and they would go through the -- to Polish -- Polish people who were under the occupied person, and they were forcibly joined the German army. So a lot of people came like that, to them. But, since the war was over, they was not taking any new people. But -- and at that time we could not go to England. My brother was trying and didn't before he -- he died. And so we're -- we were in Italy.

So there were some from the Polish insurrection, some were through ho -- went through Siberia. One of my friend was a tall, well-built woman -- girl, at that time.

It was the school and what -- how to do it. And under the -- under our school, there were food magazines. And so we had lot of rats. And in Italy you have, in Polish it's [indecipherable] it's a sort of -- something like a-- a -- over your bed when you sleep, so --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: A mosquito net.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Mo-Mosquito net. And she put her leg out, and the rat bit her once.

He wanted to study mathematics. And his professor in Polish university told him, you are too old for that. He finish, he got the doctorate in mathematics.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And we talked about this a little bit earlier, but tell me, have -- do your children know your story, your history, your experiences?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I know that my daughter once said something was so -- so out of reason. So apparently we didn't talk enough about it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see. I see. Do any of the grandchildren express interest or curiosity about these things?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Sometimes I talk, but I think they don't think it's very important. I don't know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. What would you want younger generations to understand about what your generation went through, what your parents" generation went through?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Somehow I'm dissatisfied with people who right now go out and there's no -- not enough work in Poland, so when they can go anywhere in Europe to -- to work, they do. I-- they don't really think of coming back. They don't think really that they should belong to Poland and not to be outside this. And it seems to me they're -- they're a completely different generation. I lived in free Poland, which was under 150 years when we were not free. And right now some people are -- in Poland are  <span class="page-break" number="120"></span>  124 Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 mixed up, and they don't recognize that they were not free under the Soviet occupation. There is a lot of progress in the country, as I -- I think I mentioned to you that my brother wanted to go on the bicycle to -- from Bialystok to Warsaw.</p><p>And that half of main road was paved and some half wasn't. Right now, even in the village where my mother lived there, everything is paved. There is electricity. Right now there are a lot of trees, say cherry trees, which are si-- small. So it's easy to pick. So you have to --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: They've been -- they've been raised that way, yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- start -- raised like not -- not only it's a different kind of cherries, not the big one. So that had to be change, you don't change it from year to year, you have to do it. And there, in that village where my mother was teaching, there was about 2,000 people, and one -- one with higher education only. So education was allowed, but also some people were pushed, and they should not have the -- that higher education. But definitely everybody has the -- much more opportunity. So, the villages went up, and because of that, some people from there don't feel that we were not free for so many years. We -- us being outside, we knew what was happening. They accepted what it was, and it wasn't a free Poland. So --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And so you'd want people to have a -- have a greater understanding of what freedom means.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="121"></span> </p><p> 125 Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes. And maybe it's coming. Some people say that schools are not as -- as good as it used to be. I know from my mo-mother that after we got independence in [indecipherable] the schools were -- they were supposed to be like the schools in Switzerland. That was the example for us. But my mother wa-was going with some inspector, wh-who -- who he was I don't know, about once a year for three days, to different schools in the country, where the teacher would have to pass an exam to be</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: A teacher, yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: --a teacher there. So some people were not very well educated, and the schools went -- the level of schools went up and apparently they say that right now is going down. I don't know why.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It happ -- you know, the -- it still is countries in development, after -- after such changes, it takes a while for -- for systems to work, and to improve.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes. There -- right now there are changes there -- in Poland, children start at seven, they start at six or something. And they -- I don't understand what, but --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I wanted to ask -- yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- something is not -- not very good.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I wanted to ask this question in a different way. What would you want young people, and younger generations from other countries: from the United States, from  <span class="page-break" number="122"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> 126 Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 Canada, from the U.K., from Germany, and even from Russia, and from countries outside of the European experience, what would you want the children of these countries to understand what you and your family, and the people in Bialystok, and the people in Warsaw went through? What do you think you'd like them to be able to get about that?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't think they would learn by themselves if the -- if something will happen.</p><p>But what I am not -- people -- other people are always dissatisfied, I don't like what's right now common in the world that the countries are not religious countries.</p><p>Poland was definitely Catholic country, but there was tolerance to everybody. And as I said, th-the kids who were going out of religious classes, they enjoyed that. And they could stay and learn.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not pray, but learn.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And it seems to me that only religion, when you believe -- we believe in the same God, only different, and of course, I -- I believe it is better than [indecipherable].</p><p>But is the same God. And people need to -- to believe in God, whatever it is. If they don't know, they even form belief that in several gods, or whatever, I don't know what Buddhists believe, and so on. But there is a tolerance, and it was tolerance in  <span class="page-break" number="123"></span> </p><p> 127 Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 Poland. But here, right now, I -- 1 --is my -- my own saying, that et -- atheists are not tolerant. They cannot tolerate cross somewhere on the street and somewhere.</p><p>Maybe they feel guilty that they don't believe in God, but I don't see tolerance in this country, and everywhere. And Poland right now is -- is separate of state and -- and -- and I think it's going the same direction, lack of tolerance. And I'm very dissatisfied with that, so I don't know whether people can change it again, back to religious tolerance. Well, we have Muslims in Poland, some gathering, they -- they have the -- right now they moved from east to west and so on, so it's more difficult, but those people were -- Poland was always fighting Turks and -- and Tartars, they were Muslims. So those people were taken prisoners, or were -- they were always -- they started as our enemies, fighting us. And right now we consider them just any other people. We don't have problem with -- with Muslims right now in Poland.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But we are tolerant to any religious, and it seems to me that if-- well, with Muslims it's difficult because not all of them are -- are fighting.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But it seems to me I would like young people to believe that religion is the base of the social work.</p></p></dialogue>
