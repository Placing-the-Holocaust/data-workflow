So that was only when Poland get the independence, and we started to modern life, somebody had to have the -- the shopkeepers could not be only Jewish people.

It's a some sort of accent, I don't know whether I would be able to recognize right now. Jewish people had that accent, and the best educated had the best Polish, no accent at all. You hear the much better pronunciation that others. But the just ordinary people had some sort of accent which we could recognize. They definitely had, and the older one looked like Jewish girl. So -- with the f-face. Nobody ever mentioned that they were Jewish, of course, because we never knew whether they -- even as prisoner of war, whether they would not be taken out. And I was talking to that little one. I think that she was about 10. Apparently, she joined the insurrection, and was a messenger, as I was.</p><p>And she said her biggest trouble was that when she was sent with messages to people [indecipherable] somewhere in there, and she should not ask people where to go if she mistake it.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. In the early days I have had some other people say there were streetcars that would go through, and so they could take the streetcar in. But that was in the early days of the ghetto.</p></p></dialogue>

And that was -- now, one of them, the one which was farther away from me, started to fight a few days earlier, I don't remember. And then I was walking -- we were shocked [indecipherable] we knew that they cannot survive, nothing will -- there was a Polish underground and Jewish underground, there were some connection, but we didn't have a lot of ammunition or anything, even for -- for our-ourselves, so we didn't have later. So we couldn't help, we just had to look helplessly. And we were sorry, looking at -- at people who were dying there. But on the very beginning, on that -- that other ghetto, other part was fighting and this one not. When I was going through Zelazna street, and over that big wall, I could see a woman -- it was April, it was warm enough, she was looking through the window down there. They were not fighting.

How could she be so calm, when she is going to die pretty soon? Where her people are dying? It took me a few years to understand that she was proud. She knew what's waiting for her, and Is -- I still can see her how it was, and she took it nicely. She was glad that -- that they fighting and not -- not allowing to be martyred by -- by themselves.

There was streetcar, and he said, don't go by streetcar today, not this one, because Germans put -- hung some people and so high, so you could see it from streetcar, and there were dead people there.

<dialogue class=""><p>That is that --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: On the very beginning, we didn't. I knew quite a lot because of my father pretty high position in -- in the army. So, for instance, when Russians were coming and are close to Wilno, people were saying we're Armia Kryova. At first they were treated nicely, but then they were prison there, something. So, before the insurrection, we knew already what was really expecting us, that unless we'll be strong enough to get Warsaw before the Russians would come in, but they stop, and they didn't want the allies to -- to come in London, whatever, once more they --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah.</p><p>This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Maybe later we knew. On the very beginning, nobody knows. When ghetto was starting, some couple which were Christian and Russian -- and Jewish, they could choose the -- at least the wife could stay outside. They usually would choose to go to ghetto together --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- because nobody expected that. They expected that people will be separated, but not that. Later they knew and most likely we know. But for quite a time Jewish people didn't know that when there is a transport, the transport is to be killed.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So did you know the na -- did the -- did the terms Auschwitz mean something in 1942 and 1943? Did the term Treblinka mean something?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Course.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, we believe that. And it was funny incidents, there were people in Polish army under British command, and they stopped not close to our camp, and Germans ask, why do you stop here for the night? Why your women are there? Because Germans knew. And so they went.

<dialogue class=""><p> 126 Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 Canada, from the U.K., from Germany, and even from Russia, and from countries outside of the European experience, what would you want the children of these countries to understand what you and your family, and the people in Bialystok, and the people in Warsaw went through? What do you think you'd like them to be able to get about that?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't think they would learn by themselves if the -- if something will happen.</p><p>But what I am not -- people -- other people are always dissatisfied, I don't like what's right now common in the world that the countries are not religious countries.</p><p>Poland was definitely Catholic country, but there was tolerance to everybody.

But here, right now, I -- 1 --is my -- my own saying, that et -- atheists are not tolerant. They cannot tolerate cross somewhere on the street and somewhere.</p><p>Maybe they feel guilty that they don't believe in God, but I don't see tolerance in this country, and everywhere. And Poland right now is -- is separate of state and -- and -- and I think it's going the same direction, lack of tolerance. And I'm very dissatisfied with that, so I don't know whether people can change it again, back to religious tolerance. Well, we have Muslims in Poland, some gathering, they -- they have the -- right now they moved from east to west and so on, so it's more difficult, but those people were -- Poland was always fighting Turks and -- and Tartars, they were Muslims. So those people were taken prisoners, or were -- they were always -- they started as our enemies, fighting us. And right now we consider them just any other people. We don't have problem with -- with Muslims right now in Poland.</p></p></dialogue>
