Who cared, red stars, green stars, as long as it wasn't the swastika, right? They attached themselves, and believe me, there was something for us to see, some of the Germans, wounded, no arms, no legs. They used to attach themselves with trucks, tanks, follow the column. Remember, you're talking about thousands of people marching. Not too far, that wasn't near Gleiwitz. That was in a different place. Yeah, we stay over in Gleiwitz in the train depot. Then they put us on a train -- open train to Dachau.</p></p></dialogue>

Anyway, an SS men starts searching and he winds -- winds us -- rounds us all up, brings us back to the train and we get back on the train. Why he didn't kill us, I don't know. Okay. We go to Dachau. We arrive in Dachau. No point in going into details. Open cars, freezing. God almighty.</p><p>January. February, probably. You can imagine in Germany. Okay. We wind up -- I come into Dachau.
