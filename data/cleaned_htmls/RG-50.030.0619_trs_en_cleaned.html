There were still lots of women and lots of children. There must have been about 1,500 people. That was the last transport from Nowy Dwor. Men get over to the right.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: A trip wire, okay, with just a little trip wire, a ditch, electrified by a wired fence, sentry box. So not that they needed an excuse. Anybody wanted to commit suicide, very easy. You put your foot over that trip wire, which means you're trying to escape. The guy would shoot you from the sentry box. Many of them, that's what the German transport did, about two months later, when they found out what was going on there.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And my job, and I really -- believe me, if I ever prayed always one more day, let me, I've got to -- but I'll tell you something. You know, somebody just asked is me, to what do I attribute my survival at one of my speeches. It took me a long time to figure it out, but I knew the first day when I got undressed in front of the sauna before we went in for the shower, I was standing in front of an SS man who was about 6'6. My eyes fixed in to his belt buckle. You can imagine how tall he was. To me it looked that tall, right? This is in front of the sauna. I'll never forget this as long as I live, and I look in, and what does it say on the belt buckle -- you won't believe this -- I don't know if you ever heard that, Gott mit uns. Okay. God is with us.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Is with us, yes.</p></p></dialogue>

I swear I looked in there, and for a second I had to hold myself back from laughing. I says you son of a bitch -- I didn't say that. I said not the God I learned about. I'm going to do everything in my life to outlive you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yep, yep.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Lalready saw what was going on there, and from that moment on, you will not believe, I said to myself, 750 Grand Concourse, Bronx, New York; 723 Gates Avenue, Brooklyn, New York. Right. I didn't have any pencil. I didn't have anything. I used to be the fancy writer in the house -- in my house. So every time we had -- my mother had two sisters here in the States. One of them who came in the first world war, elder sister, who lived on the concourse in New York, and the other one who left about six months before the war broke out. Her younger sister came to her. She took her down before the war. Her name was Helen Borenstein (ph). That played quite a trick on me because I screwed up the addresses. Wait till you hear this one.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Absolutely.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I did. And you know, I used -- somebody asked me why do I come in with it now. I had -- I told that story before but I delivered a speech about three months ago, four months ago over here at -- where my granddaughter lives. The teachers wanted me to come and tell them about World War II. Okay. I came in and one of the kids -- you want to hear? This is incredible. All assembly of the high school, one of the kids gets up -- and I'm pretty good at geography. So I walked over. I wanted -- I like to show them, how did so many Jews get there, to Poland, and I'm a history buff. So I know the history of the Jewish people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>

It's incredible, and I'll tell you, that's better than any history book, and I show them exactly where Auschwitz was, where Warsaw was, where I lived, right, and I tell them after I finish -- I wasn't even finished. One of the kids gets up, I ask -- I love to ask, "Any questions?" One kid, sitting there, gets up and says, "Sir, if there was something what made you really survive all this?" I says, well, it's not easy to give you an answer, I says, but I prefaced it by telling, "Look, this is a public school. I'm not going to tell you, but I had a very good religious background." I said, "By religious I don't mean Orthodox, but I</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="45"></span> ontectnetbnancedjusetneey for ther biormatierabouttfisontecion</p><p> Interview with David Wisnia 49 know -- I know my history," I says. And all I learned is something that made me -- the first moment I got in there I told them this story of being -- of looking into this SS man's middle, right, and seeing Gott mit uns. Listen to this, the kid gets up and says, "You know my grandfather" -- this could have been -- I tell you, I couldn't have planned it any better. "My grandfather came here from the Ukraine and he had one of those, and it says Gott mit uns" -- listen to this -- "one of those belt buckles. We erased the swastika and the SS, but Gott mit uns is still on there." I almost flipped out.</p></p></dialogue>

Wisnia goes to sleep there, and I wake up. It got so quiet. It must have been about 10 after 1:00 and there's nobody in there. I look out the window of the sauna and I can see (?indecipherable?) the general, with his desk, in the middle of the road of Birkenau. The whole camp is standing at attention so to speak. They're looking for Wisnia. You can imagine.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They stopped gassing -- I remember the uprising, because the sauna was right next door to the crematorium.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So the windup was that after they finished that, they actually stopped the gassings.</p></p></dialogue>

Who cared, red stars, green stars, as long as it wasn't the swastika, right? They attached themselves, and believe me, there was something for us to see, some of the Germans, wounded, no arms, no legs. They used to attach themselves with trucks, tanks, follow the column. Remember, you're talking about thousands of people marching. Not too far, that wasn't near Gleiwitz. That was in a different place. Yeah, we stay over in Gleiwitz in the train depot. Then they put us on a train -- open train to Dachau.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Okay. From the open train, I escaped with about 12 other guys. We made our way, I don't even know where, but we saw there was chaos. There was a, what do you call it, a strafing or bombing. We didn't know who, by whom. Anyway, an SS men starts searching and he winds -- winds us -- rounds us all up, brings us back to the train and we get back on the train. Why he didn't kill us, I don't know. Okay. We go to Dachau. We arrive in Dachau. No point in going into details. Open cars, freezing. God almighty.</p><p>January. February, probably. You can imagine in Germany. Okay. We wind up -- I come into Dachau. If you ever saw when I came into Auschwitz, no comparison. This was ten times worse.</p></p></dialogue>

I don't know how long we were in Dachau.</p><p>But in Dachau itself, I saw -- this was worse than Auschwitz, for me it was worse. I couldn't.

We need to work -- they were -- they wanted to work on the underground hangars for the airplanes. It is now -- must be February. Okay.</p><p>Everybody's strong enough. I'm strong enough.

So one of these, we made an attempt, a whole group, to run away, but they rounded us up. On the next time, I figured I ain't going with a group, I'm going by myself. Okay. No point in going into the details. I had a shovel over there on the side. It was one of the guys that was guarding us. I smacked him right in the head.
