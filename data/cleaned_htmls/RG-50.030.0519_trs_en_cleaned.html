And it's hard to make a living there, in Israel right now. And my uncle wrote the letter to come over here. I didn't know what he is doing. He brought me into his house, you know, the big f -- big house, took me in and my wife, and at that time I came, I had my son with me. We stayed with them. It didn't work out too good, because he, my uncle, is -- his niece was a single girl. When they brought me in over here, they always had in the mind I'm going to come in, marry that girl. When I brought my wife, wasn't so -- they weren't too happy. So when I find out what it is, 1 decided to move to go someplace else.</p><p>So a friend of mine was from my own town, and he knew that I'm not getting along, but no fights, just I know that it's not a good feeling there. So he said, move into my house. He has a  <span class="page-break" number="36"></span> </p><p> one bedroom house, and I moved in in the living room, we had a bed on the floor and we stayed together for a little bit. Then I got in -- I met a guy that is looking for a job, so I find out the guy has a [indecipherable], and his wife was my older sister's best girlfriend in Koretz. So when he finds I'm over here, so he can start talk to me, what do you want to do in America? I says, I will do anything, I just want a job. So he took me out one day, he drove around with me.

And then we pass by a lumber yard that says a -- a few Jewish people working over there, I -- I couldn't speak nothing in English, you know. He said, maybe you want to work over here, I says good. So, next morning I went to work over there. And I worked there for a few months, and before [indecipherable] he came into me one day, he says, everybody likes you over here. I want you to be the buyer to buy the lumber. I said, buy the lumber for what? I don't know how to talk. How do you gonna buy it? He said, well, I'll hire, I got a girl over here, a Polish girl, and she" ll work with you together. You do the buying. I says, you're making fun of me. He said no.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, not enough English, nothing. So, we worked there for awhile, and came back Christmastime, and I couldn't go, I couldn't drive, I didn't have no license or nothing. So a guy used to pick me up all the time, take me back to work. And this was about 20 miles. But the guy was nice to doing it, because [indecipherable] the boss in there. But by about two years I was</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="37"></span> </p><p> working over there, and everybody find out with me I'm a good worker. And they don't pay me too much. As [indecipherable] pay me 50 dollars a week, seven days a week, and I didn't care, I make maybe [indecipherable] somebody else [indecipherable] 75 dollars a week. So I go back to him, I tell, Harry, I says 75 dollars. He says, Do-Don't worry about, I'll give you 75. And then I want -- had -- need a car, so I got -- I got [indecipherable] license, I bought an old car, and I have to pay for the car, it's 800 dollars. I haven't got no money. So they say, we're gonna loan you the money, and we'll take off 20 dollars a week for your salaries. Okay. So it goes by a week, two, three, they're not taking out the money. So I go back to him, I says, wait a minute, I can't afford it, you didn't take out the money. [indecipherable] the money, you're supposed to take it from the -- my salary. Said, no, no, no, you cannot do it. He says, you have to pay right now for the four weeks. Well, okay, I have to, I have to, take it all, the whole thing, you know.

And [indecipherable] open up the lumber yard [indecipherable] the two partners. They fight -- fighting between them and he come to me and says to me, you know what? We closing up the place. I want you to go into business. You take over the place. I says, I'm gonna take over the place? I ain't got no money. Then he says, well, we'll work it out somehow. So, he went, he brought me another guy, he says, that guy's gonna go in partners with you. So another guy comes in the partners and start talking to me. He say, we're gonna go into business, does he have any money. I says no, do you have any money? He says no. So what are we going? Says well, the people what you deal with them with buying, go into Mr. Martin, tell him that you want to go into business. So I go and tell the guys they're gonna go in business. He says okay -- I-I -- I was buying for them. He says, show me your statement. I said, what's a statement? I didn't know nothing [indecipherable]. So I stayed with</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="38"></span> </p><p> them for awhile, then I stay with a partner, and going to the -- to the banker that didn't know me from somebody -- from the other people. I said the same thing, I want to go into business, but I need money. Said the same thing, give me a statement. So, I don't know what you're talking about. Make the story short, the guy gave me 3,000 dollars credit, [indecipherable] give me 3,000 dollars credit. And we got [indecipherable] in the business, had good customers, the [indecipherable] was a big builder and he paid me every week. So I got in business and that's -- I'm still in the same business.</p></p></dialogue>
