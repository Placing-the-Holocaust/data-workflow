So I took the exams and they sent me off to lo-- Loyola University, which closed in five weeks, and I went off in -- into the infantry.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was the appeal of the air force? Did you want to be a pilot, or an engineer?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- do you understand why they shut the program down, and sent every --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes, yes, the war was progressing, and they really needed troops in Europe [indecipherable] Pacific too. But it -- th-the -- mainly Europe. And the -- the -- the need for engineers were not overwhelming enough to -- to keep the -- keep the kids in school.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Where did you go to basic training?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Went through ki-- Camp Roberts, California.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I-- well, when I went [indecipherable] Camp Roberts for basic, I was supposed to go into the -- th-the AFCP six weeks basic training. But on the way to California my records got separated from me, and never arrived. So they put me in the infantry basic, 17 weeks. Which is the best thing that could have happened to me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Why?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Because wa -- when I got into combat in the infantry, I needed that.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="7"></span>  u Interview with William Hunley February 21, 2014</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The -- the extra -- extra training, basic training was very valuable to me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did you find training? Was it difficult, physically, or mentally, or what have you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: It was all difficult, but not -- not impossible, I to -- I mean, basic training [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yep.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. No problem with that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And was there any -- was there a particular military field that you wanted to go into?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I was -- I was assigned to the infantry, so that was it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. It's my understanding though, that beyond infantry, you were specifically selected as a scout sniper.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, ri-- 1-- my -- when I got in -- well, I went through the basic training, and made the mistake of being first on the rifle range. And when our [indecipherable] boarding the ship going to Europe, somebody walked up and handed me, and said here, here's your sniper rifle. And I became -- I became a scout -- scout sniper.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So there was no -- was there any specialized training specifically for sniper training?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, oh yeah, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So you were very familiar, even before basic training, you were familiar with small arms, and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh well, tha -- that time I got into a problem, because growing up on a farm, and on a river, I had guns from the time I was about six, seven years old. And one of my favorite sports in the fall was to go down to the cove, and shoot the heads off of water -- water moccasins when they -- they'd come up in the mating season, you know. And I got so that I could hit them pretty good. So when I -- when I got in the army, I was too good on the rifle range, and I--I pretty well set -- set the course.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: After basic training, where did you go?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I-- I went to the [indecipherable] reservation in California, and we were on watch for the Japanese. They really were afraid the Japanese were going to attack the west coast. They had a submarine come in, | think on either Oregon or Washington, and fire some shells ashore, and they thought that it was maybe the oncoming of another Pearl Harbor attack on the west coast. So my division was  <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion - Interview with William Hunley February 21, 2014 scattered along the coast range California. We sat there for about, I don't know, six months or so, to be there in case anything happened. Then they decided that my division was going to go to Europe, so they shipped me to -- to South Carolina for more training at Camp Buckner, and then shipped me through New England to -- to-- to France and to Germany.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When did you arrive in Europe?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Ah, let's see. January 1945.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And what wi -- did you -- you were transported by -- by troop ship?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, mm-hm. There was a--a German troop ship, she -- her -- her German name was the German equivalent of [indecipherable] and she was called Alexander B. Hamilton, in the US Navy. And she took us over.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was the crossing like?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was in January, and it was cold, and it was rough. Two weeks. And I--I did fine til 1 went down to my -- to my -- to the bunkroom. My bunk was on G deck, the lowest one down, right against the fore big bulkhead.

And when si -- to go to -- to eat, you had to go up [indecipherable] the ladder to the main deck and stand -- get in a line, and the -- the feeding was continuous. The line went around all day long, and you'd go wa -- go up, got in the line, went over to eat, and if you felt you might be hungry again during the day, you went around twice. Then back down to -- down to the bunkroom. Well, I went down to the bunkroom, that's on my first [indecipherable] and going down that ladder, all the way up and down, that really fixed it. And when I got down there, the whole bunkroom was about that deep, with the re-results of the other pe -- other people's had eaten lunch. Man, that was awful. So immediately I got assigned latrine duty, of course, which was cleaning up the whole place. That -- that made it a very miserable trip.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you make any friends on the way over, or did you have any special friends before landing in Europe?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, the -- the people that were my friends were the people I went to school with. We all got -- went and got [indecipherable] over the same -- in -- in at the same time. So the people I went over with were people I had gone -- gone to school with, and they -- they stayed with me, long as I was in the -- the division. And of course, when we came back, we were get -- we were -- came back from -- from the war, we were all still in the reserves, and we all got called up on the same orders to go to -- to Korea. And I was working for the navy then, and the navy didn't want me to go. I was -- I was there working on ship design. So they fought the -- the orders all the way up the line and got -- got me released from the orders, and I stayed and worked for the navy. The rest of my buddies went to Korea, none of them came back.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, the first impres -- impression was that it needed to warm up a little bit. It was January, so th-the -- the fresh goop had melted, and when you stepped into the goop you were up to your knee, and the next time you went almost to your hip. And when you pulled your leg up, it weighed a ton. Bad. I had -- I had read about that, and I talked to family and friends who had been in World War I, and I knew it -- what it was going to be like. That was really a [indecipherable].</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And now, when you arrived at LaHavre, your unit did not immediately go into combat --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- there was some -- what happened in betw -- what happened with those tr --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, we went -- we did a lot of training and maneuvers and camping and all that kind of stuff in France, and then we finally shipped up to -- to Germany, up through Belgium, across Luxembourg, and into Germany at Trier.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.

I just finished reading the book called [indecipherable] Patton. And one section in it they discuss the -- the -- the - Ohrdruf, and Eisenhower and Patton came to s -- to see the place, and they said it was so bad, that it upset Patton so bad that he went off to the side and -- and lost his lunch.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well -- well, I was -- it was weakening, because we were gradually wiping out the ones that were in there. And I got into some pretty -- pretty fierce set-ons myself.</p><p>At one time -- one point, we were leaving a unit of the 76" division, and my platoon moved up to relieve one of that platoons, and I walked alongside the platoon sergeant, and he stood up. And of course, Patton required that we wear our insignia  <span class="page-break" number="31"></span> ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion as</p><p> Interview with William Hunley</p><p> February 21, 2014</p><p> on our helmet right there, in gold. Nice and fi -- nice and flashy. So he stood up, and when he stood up, bing, right through his insignia. And the next shot was for me, but somehow he missed. I don't know how, because he had a fine rifle, and a fine telescope. But he missed. And I got down behind a spruce tree about that big. And he shot a group just where Id be, though the -- his first tree, about this wide, he had about like that. And he wa -- he sees -- he saw some part of me, I guess that -- that he thought, or at least he thought he did, and he was shooting at, and he -- and he had put right in there. He was shooting one of their -- I ca -- I can't remember the designation [indecipherable] 10 shot semi-automatic -- automatic rifles, that they designed and built to counter the M-1 rifle.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, we're actually across the -- actually across the Rhine, they definitely [indecipherable] slowing -- slowing down. And the troops there who were -- who we were battling, were becoming less and less efficient.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Some of them were very poor shots. That's the reason I'm still here.

But that was [indecipherable] where we ran into SS troops, and people were very topnotch soldiers. And at the end, when we were -- when we wound up at -- at Langenbach, we were getting ready for another push on the fifth of -- fifth of March, I think, we -- fifth of April -- fifth of May, we were having another push into sh -- into  <span class="page-break" number="37"></span> ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion 4 Interview with William Hunley February 21, 2014 Czechoslovakia, and there was a whole -- I don't know how the arrangement is of SS troops, and the other t-topnotch troops that had been digging in and getting ready. And we were p-p-pushing off against them. But that would have been -- that would have been a horrible battle. But just the -- the -- we lined -- we lined up th-the -- the -- the infantry lined up in battle formation, the trucks started their engines, the tanks started their engines.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Very odd. And ye-ye -- course th -- y-you didn't -- ye -- we had no idea whether -- whether we could trust them or not, you know?

But by 1950, they were -- they were at a point where they were starting to assemble a ship design team again for the future. And I went in on ja -- speculation just to see if there was anything that I could get to do. And they hired me as a -- a part-time draftsman.

Practically all the traffic in until -- until I was born, practically all the traffic into Matthews County was by boat, so there wasn't much traffic in and out. And the language tended to be preserved. The men who worked on ships, they went all over and they -- gradually the men's language changed. The women's language stayed pretty much Elizabethan. When I was kid they still used something very close to Elizabethan English. I had a lot of that -- a lot of [indecipherable]. And this -- thi-this -- so I still had a lot of that. So when I went to college, lot of the kids couldn't understand what I said. And Carol showed up, they said hey, you speak the language.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh well, I--I did quite a bit of de -- the design work for the navy under contract.</p><p>And I designed a few [indecipherable] vessels, some smaller vessels, 40 -- 40 -- 45 foot work boats and fishing boats, things like that. And I designed the -- the [indecipherable] for the alexan -- Alexandria Seaport Foundation.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: After I retired, I-- I joined the Alexandria Seaport Foundation, and in "92 I became chairman of the Seaport Foundation. And at that time we had the old schooner, Alexandria, 125 foot [indecipherable] schooner. And I started a boatbuilding school to ha-have something for the kids at Alexandria and Washington -- whole Washington area to do. And we -- we -- it really took off, I was amazed at that. You know, wh-when I went to set it up, I talked to the city council, and they weren't very interested. I went and talked to the school board, ah, you're wasting your time, they said, your kids don't want to do anything like that,  <span class="page-break" number="53"></span> ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion = Interview with William Hunley February 21, 2014 they want to play in the streets and all. But I--I persisted and I got the school started in 1992, and I started off with a -- a group of 15 little kids that were 12 - 14 years old, and had a group of neighborhood supporters that would support them.</p><p>And they all came in and we split them up into groups of five kids, with at least one adult with each group, so that they had some good supervision. I started them building little wooden boats. And I -- we found that boy, when -- when a lot of -- most of those kids -- most of them when they came, they were -- boats didn't mean anything at all to them. And doing anything with their hands didn't mean to them.</p><p>They didn't di -- they'd never done anything. But when they came in to us, about a week of working on a little boat that was going to be theirs when they finished, as long as they could actually do something, man, the effect was amazing. So that's gone on since "92 and it just kept on growing, it's national now. A-As our system that we developed has been spread all over the country, and now a hundred, 185 organizations in the country that use our system, teaching kids to build little wooden boats. The little wooden boat is -- is the key to it. They come in, and they get started with hammer and -- and chisels and saws, things they had never touched before, and they learn to use those things, and they start building a little boat that they can see, I can do something that's going to last and will be good for me --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Sure.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="54"></span>  58</p><p> Interview with William Hunley</p><p> February 21, 2014</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And that -- it really gets them. Works very good. Then, a-after we got that going good, we started adding classroom exercises to help them with their schoolwork, and now we teach mathematics and physics and hi-history, and a couple of other courses occasionally, for the kids that are in high school and have trouble with a -- with the high school. They don't do well in -- in math, a lot of the -- a lot of the boys particularly don't do well in math because they're sitting there working on mathematical problems that don't relate to anything. They can't see any -- any sense in it at all because it doesn't -- doesn't relate to the things they do. But when they come in, we start teaching them to use mathematics to lay out the boats and [indecipherable] and all that kind of stuff, and they see the use for it, it makes a big difference.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, yeah, professionalism, and in the way that indu -- individ-individuals reacted with each other, the ones who had enlisted tended to be more interactive and worked together better than the ones that were drafted.

They didn't want me to go, because I was working on a ship design business, and so they managed to the -- get the orders -- pre -- get me off the orders. And that amazed me too, because th-they have to track it up unit by unit.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When did you decide to leave Alexandria and live where you are now?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I-- well, I always said, living in Alexandria, we became interested in this old little village of Waterford up in Loudoun County. You know Waterford?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They have a very won -- they had a wonderful -- well, they still have a wonderful annual event where they have the old homes tour and colonial craft exhibits. I was very interested in -- in the colonial crafts. I trava -- I'm a gunsmith and make furniture, and all that kind of stuff. So I used to go to Waterford and go -- go there for the fair every year, and got to working with some of the craftsman up there on  <span class="page-break" number="59"></span> ontactrefiranneGaushariarg a hither atrmedortabeattfiexaliaton a Interview with William Hunley February 21, 2014 different things. So I -- we got -- both of us got so interested in it that we watched for a--a lot that we could buy, we were looking for a house, really. But we -- none of the houses came up for sale that we could -- could ha -- could handle. So a lot came up for sale, so we bought the lot, 1968, and then we started drawing back -- I started making designs for houses. And, of course, in Waterford they had all -- had all kinds of restrictions on what you could build because they wanted to keep the tenor of the village. So I designed what I thought was a real [indecipherable] house, and I took it to the [indecipherable] took it to the -- the architect who was the [indecipherable] on what you could build. Showed it to him, he said, oh, that's a nice little house Bill, but that -- that's -- that would look beautiful in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, but that's not for Waterford. So I went back, and I designed a brick house. Oh, he said, man, Williamsburg. Beautiful Williamsburg house. Not for Waterford. So about that time, my wife was reading [indecipherable] the "Washington Post," and at the bottom end of the classified ads was, log house for sale. They were tearing down a log house because they built -- had new houses all around it, they -- they couldn't do anything except tear -- tear down and move it. So we went over -- she said, let's go over and take a look at it.</p><p>Well, that was the first week in May, 1970. And I said, oh, I'm too busy, I can't take -- make it. So next week she tried again. The house was still for sale. Third  <span class="page-break" number="60"></span> ontactrefiranneGaushariarg a hither atrmedortabeattfiexaliaton "a Interview with William Hunley February 21, 2014 week, still for sale, tried again. The fourth week, Sunday -- Sunday afternoon, it was raining cats and dogs, the kids were grumpy as all get out. Said okay, let's take the kids over, we'll go look at it. So we went over and there's this log house. By that time they'd taken the roof off, and it was raining for all week, and water dripping on everything. We opened the back door, and the inside of the house had been lone -- had been lined with [indecipherable] board, you know, this fabulous tan, soft fiber, insulating board? And when we opened the back door there was enough [indecipherable] that the whole ceiling collapsed, and two tons of water and all frazzly wood came down. But it opened up everything so I could see all the logs.</p><p>And it was in good shape. Only two logs needed some -- some moderate repairs. So right there we bought the log house, and we [indecipherable] hire a guy to haul the logs over to our lot to Waterford so we could rebuild it. And he started loading up the logs, he says, hey, you know, my father's got a log house three miles over there, that he hasn't used for 10 years, he'd probably sell that to you, if you wanted it. So [indecipherable] that was very reasonable, so I bought that and they moved both of them over, and we combined the two of them to make one house in Waterford.</p><p>And we finished it [indecipherable] lived in it to the point where we lived in it about 1975. And we had -- still had floors missing, and no doors or windows installed, things like that, but we moved in in time for the kids to go to school in the  <span class="page-break" number="61"></span> ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion 6s Interview with William Hunley February 21, 2014 fall, and then I built it up from the inside. So that's how -- that's how we got into that.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I'm sorry.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But she enjoyed the house as long as she was there. She liked it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was planning on building a boat, I had -- had -- had a design along the way for a 36 footer.

We ought to -- we ought to go look at that. I put her off for a month, just -- when I went to look at it, she finally got me. So I never -- never built my boat.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
