<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, I'm Arwen Donahue and we're here at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum and it's November 17, 1995. I'm here with Mr. Nicholas Winton. And Mr. Winton if you would state for me your date of birth and place of birth?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was born on the 19th of May 1909 in London.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And will you say something for me about your family background, what your father did, and your mother, and what you remember?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My father was a banker, Mother was born in Nuremberg and was the first girl in Germany to take the Ivy tour which is the matriculation when that exam became open for girls. And she came to London after her marriage when she was very young. She was still 17.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was the atmosphere in your home like in your early years?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was very... it was marvelous. We were in a home which Father's parents had owned previously. It was an enormous 20 room house with a billiard table in I remember, and yes we were happy there. It was in the north of London in Hampstead and Father moved from banking after the war to importing glass from Czechoslovakia. He joined a firm which imported glass. Yes, it was very as far as I can remember, a congenial atmosphere.</p><p>Nearly 85 years ago now, so I don't know how much one genuinely remembers from one's childhood.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, you traveled to Germany when you were fairly young, did you not?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, we traveled to Germany on holiday because Mother's relatives were still in Nuremberg. Mother's mother was still in Nuremberg and brothers and sisters were still over there. And of course when Hitler arrived on the scene, so the family that had been still in Germany started to come over to England and of course Mother and Father were able to help them not only to come over but to...to look after them. They all stayed with us to start with before making their separate ways in the world.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How would you describe.... were you aware of Hitler from the beginning of his rise to power, and did you know anything about him?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think we did, because when Hitler came to power in 1933 I was 24 and I... from my youth I think I've always been very politically conscious and always very left wing and I joined all kinds of things which would have been protesting against things like Hitler represented. Yes, I think we were very aware of it from early on, especially having gone through the first world war also where you had that... not anti-semitic feeling, but</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Later on, one had not only the anti-semitic but the anti-German feeling together.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When you were... before you become a London stock broker, correct me if I'm wrong, you had traveled to Germany to study banking?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. Well, Father, as I said, had been a banker, and he thought that my career should be in banking, and that a little travel would do me good, and I was in a bank in France for a year and then six months with a bank in Hamburg and then six months for the bank in Berlin, and I would have gone on to do banking over here in the States were it not for the big crash occurring in "29, and so Father thought it was about time I came home, instead of him spending money on me, and some of my own.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you interested in banking?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, I think I was interested in banking and finance, yes. I dare say I would have accomodated myself to any other profession I'd be put in, but banking seemed to suit me quite well, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What are your recollections from those months that you spent in Germany, political recollections? Did you witness persecution?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: When I was in Germany which would have been in 1930, I have no political recollections at all really. I mean I did banking, I made a lot of friends. I was good at fencing and I was both in Hamburg and in Berlin in the local fencing club, and met a lot of friends there-- and in fact I even fenced for Germany. At that time in 1930, there was a big match against Denmark, actually. I was on their team and I also owned a boat on the Wansee and spent the weekends boating. So at that time there was no -- I mean I wasn't interested in politics as such at that time and it was of course prior to... it was three years before Hitler even came on the scenes. So, no I wasn't in any way politically interested at that period.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When would you say that your political awareness was focused?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I mean in England I was always politically aware of politics, but local politics, British politics. And it was really only slowly, after 1933, when the implications of what was happening in Germany were known, that I became kind of interested in that.</p><p>Because, as I say, I was always very interested in politics, and my friends were always very interested in politics, and we were all pretty well left-wing and we used to have meetings and discuss things so that really directly Hitler became a factor in European life.</p><p>Yes, we were very interested in that, very. We became more so as he became more aggressive and took over more of Europe.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can you describe your friendship with Martin Blake?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, Martin Blake had always been a friend of mine. He was a master at Westminster School in London, and he and I shared lots of interests, but chiefly political interests. We also liked winter sports, and he took a party of children to winter sports every year in Switzerland, and I accompanied him which had the advantage of, for very little trouble or expense of energy, we got a free holiday. And, we were very close. We were always together and nearly always with other people who were discussing politics in some way or other reasonably left wing politics because there was a lot going on at that time as Hitler became more and more influential in Europe.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember any of your discussions?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, not in detail really no. They were anti- Hitler, though. I can't remember the details. The politics in England at that time were so complicated. You had the people who were very frightened about the rise in Hitler, and yet one of the biggest left-wing movements was the Peace Pledge Union which in a way was contrary to what was going on in Europe. So, it was a very curious period, which was highlighted later on, of course, by the way Chamberlain and other people dealt with the rise of Hitler. They were also very schizophrenic about it. They didn't really know how... how to handle it. They still thought that... that this idea of peace could be maintained and... Very difficult to discuss the feeling in England at that time, because there were of course a lot of people like there were in every country, because of the rise, just because of the rise of left wing influence who were becoming more and more right wing. So, there were crowds of people in England who at that time were very right-wing, as epitomized by Oswald Mosely and his people, whom I actually knew quite well at that time. He was in our fencing club, Sir Oswald Mosely. He seemed quite inoffensive when he was fencing but he commanded quite a political clout later on.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you have particular ideas after the rise of Hitler of what should be done, what you wanted to do or that you felt you should do something in response?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I think in a democracy the individual always feels rather powerless, you know.</p><p>You could feel it and talk about it and discuss it but except voting for a government there was nothing one could really do about it. My political awareness of Hitler really was only crystallized when I got to Prague and really saw for myself. One could see individually what was happening from time to time but there was little one could do about it. I mean, one is very powerless really, the individual in a democracy. And yes, we discussed it and we discussed the dangers of it, at the same time as this peace pledge movement was going on, so it was very curious situation at that time. But there were lots of people in England who weren't that much frightened by Hitler at the time, you know, who felt that the danger wasn't Hitler at all. The danger was Russia. And a great many people at that time I don't think ever thought that we would really be in conflict with Germany, because they thought that the politicians would be adept enough to see that the Germans fought Russia and not us.</p><p> In the event, of course, they fought both, but not in the order we expected.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, Martin Blake, at this time, was working with refugees, was he not?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no, Martin Blake really had nothing to do with refugees at all. Martin Blake knew a lot of people politically as well as of course his work for the school and he was very friendly with one lady Doreen Wariner who was the representative for the British Committee for Czechoslovakia and was given the job of going out to Prague and heading a movement to try and save those who had arrived in Czechoslovakia and were politically endangered since the Germans... when the Germans... if the Germans arrived. That was of course after the... Hitler marched in Sudetenland. And he rung me up one day just before he was setting off for Prague and said, "Look, I've cancelled my trip to winter sports so yours is cancelled too. I'm in a rush-- I can't tell you what's going on but meet me in Prague and I'll tell you," and that's how I got to Prague. I really didn't know what I was in for when I left.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When was that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: When was that? That was Christmas "38, "39. I don't know the actual dates anymore.</p><p>That was Christmas "38, "39. And I went out and met him, Blake, one evening, I knocked him up at the hotel Sroubek and he told me what was happening.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What did he tell you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well he told me that there was all these people who had come into Czechoslovakia mostly after the Germans marched into Sudetenland, and that they were the Jews, they were the writers, they were those who were on Hitler's blacklist, and I think there were five separate groups, all of whom were endangered, and the job of Doreen Wariner and the British Committee was to try and rescue them and get them out to England. And at that time, of course, they were... a lot of the people were living with friends or relatives whom they knew in Czechoslovakia but a lot of them were already in camps. And I went "round the camps to see what was going on, together with actually two ladies who were given into my custody to look after whilst I did these tours, and one was Eleanor Rathbone, the member of parliament, and the other was the Reverend Rosalind Lee, who was the head of the Unitarian church. And we toured "round these camps in the dead of winter and snow. It was all rather cold and pathetic to see what was going on. And I suppose that's when my final... when more of my ideas about really what was going on in the continent were formed.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were these camps all located near Prague?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The ones we saw were located near Prague. I remember we went by car but whether we hired a taxi or whether we were moved around I really can't remember but they were, yes, in the vicinity of Prague. They were Nissenhunt (ph) camps, and very over-crowded, and very nasty places for continuous living.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember what you saw there, anything in particular stand out?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: What, at the camps?</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I can't remember except that on my way out to Prague I met a gentleman called Mr.</p><p>Hails who said he was out there to do business. He was in the motorbike business... I think he was going to buy motorbikes, and I said that he couldn't really know what as going on in Europe if he thought he could buy motorbikes at this particular time in Czechoslovakia, and he said, "Well what are you doing?" and I said, "I really don't know at the moment, but this will be my address, and if you've got time come and visit me." And he visited me the second day I was there and I took him "round the camps. And in talking to him actually I found out that he was the Mr. Hails who instigated the Atlantic Blue Ribbon for the big boats, so he must have been in that kind of business. And going round the camps, he suddenly disappeared, and I went back to look for him. He was on one of the beds crying his eyes out. He was not knowing what he was going to be in for; he hadn't really expected that I would take him into that kind of situation.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, would you say that most people weren't aware that these camps existed?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I shouldn't think in England that anybody was aware of it all. I don't really know. I should think a lot of people in Prague must have known about it, yes, but whether it was known in England I don't know. I mean, we were... obviously everybody knew that the Germans marched into Sudetenland. Everybody in England said, you know, "This is Hitler's last ambition, and he's not going to do any more." When I was over there and found out that in marching into Sudetenland not only meant that they were marching into that part of Czechoslovakia which was chiefly inhabited by Germans, but all their defenses were in that line too, so from that moment on Czechoslovakia was pretty defenseless in any case. And of course Prague was full of Germans already. We were followed "round the whole time by the Germans. So one could see what was going on. I wrote home and said, "Look, this is happening," they either didn't want to or didn't believe that what we were actually seeing there meant what we were perfectly certain that it meant: that the Germans were on their way.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Where were you staying?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I stayed at the Hotel Sroubek which we stayed at when we were over in Prague four or five years ago, when we were... I got the Freedom of Prague and met Havel and had lunch with Dubcek. It was all very exciting. We stayed at the same hotel that I had been at in 1939, right in central Prague.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And was Martin Blake staying with you there as well?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, he didn't. I think he was already dead --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No, at the time. In "38.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He was in the Sroubek, yes.</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, will you describe to me how you became aware that you were going to be working on this issue of refugees in Prague and how you came to that decision?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, as I said I went round the camps and I was told of the people whom the British Committee were trying to get out. And every day I met up with Doreen Warriner to discuss what was going on and we usually met at one of the big hotels, the Alcron, and discussed what was going on. Usually there were one or two men sitting not far away, and she had to say to me in German, "Until that gentleman disappears we better discuss the weather." You could be as rude as you'd like to the Germans as English people at that time, because we certainly didn't, and I mean, they certainly, I don't think, at that time ever thought they were going to be at war with England. And we of course hoped they wouldn't. And in conversation she said, "There are all these children, you know, who should be got out, but the British Committee just can't do anything about it at all. They're far too overworked with the business of trying to get out the political refugees, the writers and all those people endangered," and said to me, "Look, if anything can be done, perhaps you'd like to try and do it," and that's really how it started.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you aware at that point that England had made the decision to let in a certain number of children?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I hadn't got a clue. I found a gentleman who came out from England, Trevor Chadwick, who said that if it was possible to bring children out, he'd given up his job as teaching in Swannage (ph), he'd run the office in Prague. And I said, "Well, I've not got a clue whether you can bring children into England, but stay there, and I'll go back to England and find out if anything can be done." And so, I mean, when I left Prague nobody had any idea that anything would really transpire. In the end it didn't prove very difficult. The Home Office said, "Under certain conditions," which they laid down, "you can bring in as many children as you like." So, the Home Office made no difficulties at all. Getting children into other countries was more difficult. We got a few children into Sweden whilst I was still in Prague, but later on I don't know if that movement continued.</p><p>But we didn't bring out children to anywhere else except into England. We tried to get children into America but that wasn't possible at that time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did you try to do that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well I have letters with a lot of the important people in America at that time and they all gave excuses -- no it's not fair to say excuses -- they gave reasons why they couldn't allow children to be brought into America at that time, which makes pretty sad reading when you read these letters at the present day. But still, that was... I mean bringing over 600 children was something I suppose, but many more could have been brought over had we... had we had more time as well, of course. I don't think a lot of people realized the urgency which we felt was there. Having been in Prague, one could almost feel that it was any time the Germans could march in. Back in London, of course, that urgency wasn't there at all.</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you were in Prague for three weeks?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was in Prague about a fortnight. That was as long as my holiday allowed, and even then I was getting letters: Why did I want to spend time in Czechoslovakia when I should come back and make money for my firm on the stock exchange? There was no-- certainly not in the city-- there was no real feeling of either urgency or things should be done, you know. It was rather the, generally the Chamberlain attitude, you know: putting oneself out for a little country far away with which we had no genuine obligations. The major factor of Hitler versus Europe wasn't really in people's minds at that time, despite what Hitler had done up to then. And I think there were lots of people who would have obviously far preferred to maneuver Hitler to fight against Russia first than for us to take up the cudgels. After all, there had been plenty of time for England and France and the West to take up against Hitler, but before then there was plenty of occasions, as he had been nibbling away at various parts of Europe, that we could say, "Enough, and no further." I mean, by the time we took a stand on the Polish issue most of Europe had been already absorbed, or a lot of it anyway. So, I suppose historians will be writing about that for a long time: whether or not it could have been done differently. I don't think that people, certainly in England, realized the danger. They always thought they could negotiate with Hitler, that in a way he was a smaller menace than what was happening elsewhere in the world.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was the date... do you remember the first... How did you get the first transport out of Czechoslovakia?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I was only then, when I came back to England I was working on the stock exchange, which luckily was a job which finished at 3:30 in the afternoon so I could go back and carry on trying to... to make arrangements for bringing children over. And as I say, the British Committee for Refugees from Czechoslovakia didn't give me... weren't able to give me either office space or any help whatsoever. And I just had note paper printed with their name on it, and put under, "Children's Section," worked from my private home up in Hampstead. And the Reverend Rosalind Lee whom I mentioned, sent me the first 100 pounds to pay for correspondence and everything and we got newspapers like Picture Post to write articles saying that we were looking for guarantors and that we were looking for homes where these children would be looked after until the end of war.</p><p>And this started to trickle in, and, as we got people who would take children, so we sent them lists of children and even photos of children, and got them to choose children, and we then sent these out to Trevor Chadwick in Prague, who then arranged for the transport and the getting the children together, whilst we arranged for the people who were receiving the children to arrive at Liverpool Street Station to receive them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can we go back to Prague for just a little while and will you tell me about how you started the operation going, you came to the realization that the children needed help and then what did you do?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When you were in Prague, the end of 1938 and the beginning of 1939 what did you do after you realized that the children needed help in escaping Europe?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Once I told Doreen Warriner that if it were possible to do it I would try and do it and knowing that when I came back to England I would have to go back to work, the thing was to arrange the set up in Prague which could go into operation should I be successful when I got back to London. The person who was in charge -- I put in charge then was Trevor Chadwick but there was a Mr. Barozetti who was secretary to Doreen Warriner and he kind of ran the office in which Trevor Chadwick had space. The first job of course was as I said there were five committees in Prague at that time, was to get one central list. I mean you can't work from five lists and try to pick out who are the most important people or the most urgent cases. They were very diffident of course to give up their lists and having such a very short time in Prague I had to use kind of black mail tactics bringing up eventually I think it was the communist committee saying that I had one list on which I would work and the others could join if they wanted to, otherwise none of the lists would be considered. So within a couple of days we got a joint list and we discussed at that time how the office in Prague would have to work if I could be successful in London. So, it was all a bit hairy fairy and nebulous and it may happen and it may not.</p><p> But there was an awful lot to be done in Prague if it did come off. They'd have to get all these children together. They'd have to get exit permits from the -- well, when I left Prague of course it wasn't the German authority because the Germans only arrived in March, but the time we really got going the Germans were in charge because they arrived in March 1939 and then of course they had to get exit permits from the Germans for these children to leave. They then had to arrive with to get a train and then they had to arrange for escorts to go with the train. They then had to find out from <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> handicapped children, lame children, or blind children. For children and animals, the two most easiest things to get sympathy and raise money.</p><p> So, it went slowly but it did work. We never got obviously as many guarantors as we wanted but we didn't have an awful lot of time to work on them and when we got the guarantee for a reasonable number of people we'd do the paper work and send it out to Prague and Prague then had all the job of arranging the trains and the escorts and the money and dealing with all the parents and getting the children onto the train. It was quite an operation in Prague.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When you're compiling lists of the children, did all five committees end up cooperating?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, as I say, we told each individual committee eventually that we can't work with five lists, and before I left Prague they had agreed to coordinate and make one list and I think there was already one list before I left. So, the people in Prague did work on that one list.</p><p>Obviously it wasn't only people who were on that list who came out. I mean there were people very likely who weren't on the list who heard of this operation going on and wanted to send their children away. I mean, how can you tell which are really the most urgent. I mean I suppose any Jewish child at that time was the most urgent politically of course, it was more difficult to decide and that one had to rely on the committees to do.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you present when the decisions were being made and were you involved in the decision making process?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was only concerned with the decision making process in the end product of where the children were going. I mean I was in England so I couldn't in any way influence who came. That was decided in Prague by Trevor Chadwick and with the aid of other people who were working there. I suppose the records which I've got here that 92 percent of the children were Jewish so that 8 percent were either on Hitler's blacklist or were communists or were writers or were children of that type who were in danger, and I think we've hardly made any of them who ever saw their parents or relatives again. Very few, very, very few.</p><p> So, I suppose that in itself shows -- I mean whatever Jew that was brought out was the right Jew wasn't it. They were all in danger.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: While you were in Prague, did you interview any parents, children?</p></p></dialogue>

But there's very little I can remember about that now, but yes, certainly people the whole time were trying to influence you and leaving crates of pilsner beer behind. Well, you can imagine they tried to use what influence they could. I don't think we really, to be quite honest, took any notice of it. You couldn't. You have to be very tough in charitable work. Feel soft hearted in charitable work it becomes impossible. You really got to treat it as a business and we had these lists and we went by them.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you feel that you were living two lives?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It's only difficult to ask me how I felt 50 odd years ago, but no I don't think so. I mean I just left one office and went home and did the other work. It didn't seem strange to me at the time. I had the police corp on me. I remember asking why I had that enormous correspondence with Czechoslovakia from a private house, but I think I was far too busy to entertain those kinds of thoughts at that time. It was two different lives. I mean people mostly on the stock exchange or a lot of people on the stock exchange I didn't talk to about what I was doing. I mean nearly all of them or most of them had completely different political views and opinions to mine so there was really no point in discussing it. They couldn't help in any way. At least some of them whom I was more friendly with very likely gave me some money for the running of the office, but I can't really remember those details any more.</p><p> You see this story didn't exist for 50 years at all until suddenly the whole thing became public. That's why all these children are meeting themselves for the first time and some of them are making new friends. Some of them meeting people they didn't know existed and some of them even finding relatives.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So people just if they knew considered it perhaps a quirk or some particular interest but didn't inquire into it very extensively?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, there was no common denominator where they could. 150 children coming over and disbursed all over the place in England. Nearly all of them not finding their parents any more. Some of them kept in touch with each other but there was no organization or anything which in any way brought them together until five or six years ago when the story about the children broke.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't think when I left the city at 3:30 most of the people knew what I was doing in the evenings. I don't think so. There was certainly nobody I knew in the city who in any way helped me with what I was doing with regard to the children, nobody at all. It was two existences, separate, self contained.</p></p></dialogue>

You needed a lot of effort and work and initiative and dealing with authority and all that, that was general knowledge. It wasn't any particular knowledge. It wasn't like the workings of the stock exchange where you had to know how it worked and what the commissions were and what you had to do and when you had to do it and for whom you had to do it and what the price was and remember the price when you were doing something else. It was nothing like that in dealing with children. No, it was quite different.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Will you describe your relationship with the Jewish community in Britain as they knew that you were doing this work?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Thad no connection with the Jewish community in England because I was brought up as a Christian. I was baptized and I was brought up as a Christian. My parents were Jewish but completely non-religious and I think that we were treated as rather a curiosity. We didn't fit into either community. I mean the Jewish people thought we kind of opted out and at that time the Christian community must have thought -- I don't know I'm putting ideas into their minds now, it's rather a curious Christian with a German-Jewish name.</p><p>So, we really didn't fit into anybody and I suppose it was this kind of schizophrenia which made up a lot of my character at that time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was the Jewish community aware that you were working to rescue mostly Jewish children from Czechoslovakia?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I suppose they were but I was very much -- it was very much me and one or two people who were doing this. I wasn't assisted -- I mean the British committee for Refugees from Czechoslovakia I know a great number of those were yes, run by the Jewish people but I was quite separate to them, although I used their name until right to the end of the period in I think it was July, August when they said yes, you've been so successful now you better come and join us and they gave me a room at Bloomsbury House. But until then I got no money from them and no assistance from them. In the various committees throughout the countries for whom most of the guarantees for the children came, I would imagine a lot of those were run by Jewish people, yes. But I was only in touch with them by correspondence so I never really met them in that way.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were there any repercussions?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: There was nothing they could do about it. The only repercussions were as I say after we had been doing that if you like illegally for nearly five months they then said this organization calling themselves the British Committee for Refugees from Czechoslovakia Children's Section is somebody who calls himself Nicky Winton calling himself honorary secretary we declare that they're now part of our organization and we became then a kind of accepted part of the group. Before it had been accepted in that way, in a kind of legal way, it had been accepted by everybody who knew no better. People out in the country getting a letter from the British Committee Children's Section had no reason to believe that it wasn't the British Committee as such. So, it worked quite good.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When you say we did you have any help writing these letters?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Thad a lady, a girl, who came to help me who had been working for the Christian council and she came every evening and she did all the typing, who in fact later on married Martin Blake. I don't think we had anybody else. We were really just the two of us. It was really a question of keeping the flow of correspondence going and getting the information in from Prague, getting pictures of the children so that when somebody would take a child we could send them photos and ask them to pick a child, it's unfortunate commercial way of doing it. Perhaps that's where my stock exchange upbringing came in, but it speeded things up at the time and we felt that speed was of the essence.</p><p> End of Tape 1</p><p> Tape 2</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I had just asked Mr. Winton if he would like to say anything else about his relationship with members of the Jewish community in Britain and what their response was to this work you were doing?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Although most of the children we brought out were Jewish I was only looking for families who looked after children. I wasn't concerned at all whether these children went to Jewish or non-Jewish families and this was largely due to the fact that I think that those people had been out in Prague and those people knew what I was doing, Martin Blake and Doreen Wariner and all that were very conscious of the urgency which one could see out there. There was no question when we were looking for a family to look after the children that a Jew should go to a Jew or a non-Jew should go -- it seemed to us at that time perhaps because I'm non-religious myself I don't know but it seemed to me completely secondary. The chief thing was to save the children. This was a not a view shared by everybody because there was one organization in England which was called The Barbican Mission and they took quite a number of children. I don't really know how many. I mean not an extraordinary number but quite a few children, and they were in</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And I thought the most important thing was to save the children rather than save the religion. But I did have a deputy in my office once of rabbis who came in and really told me something for the first time something that <span class="page-break" number="12"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 4 now. She's 90. You see, a lot of them -- of the ones we know where the guarantor is still alive, they're very faithful in keeping in touch. Of course, one must admit that a lot of the children weren't happy where they were sent and there was an after care department in fact when the war started that Mother looked after which tried when children had problems to get the problems settled or get new guarantors for them. But I certainly don't assume and one cannot assume that every child we brought over went into a home and was well treated and was happy. A lot of them we know were. We certainly know some that were not, who were badly treated and used as servants.</p><p> But quite frankly at the time I didn't think of it and it really doesn't concern me very greatly now. I mean you're bound to have some who weren't happy and all one can say is that they are still alive whereas most of the other children aren't. One knows that the children were targeted as much as the grownups because the last transport was due to leave at the beginning of September. It would have been our biggest. 250 children, an enormous amount of work. Can you imagine getting 250 children from all over the place onto a station in Prague and then getting 250 guarantors to organize that they should all be at Liverpool Street Station at a certain time to receive the people whom they had taken. Then, of course, war broke out. The transport was cancelled and as far as we've heard from people who should not know a single one of those children survived.</p><p> So, as I say, I think when you do charity work as I said before, you've got to be pretty tough and if you were concerned more with the fact of are they going to be happy than have they got somebody who will feed and clothe them, you wouldn't bring over nearly as many. I mean the whole operation would really be different. We tried to and all the people who all these committees I talked to around the country they told us that they would not send us any person who would take a child unless they them so to a very great extent they were , but it doesn't mean to say that some don't <span class="page-break" number="13"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 5</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you meet any of the transports when they arrived?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: All of them, all of them. Yes, I was at Liverpool Street Station when every transport arrived which was near to organized chaos as you'll ever get. And that in the name went well. One always has stories of those that got left behind on the platform because there was nobody to pick them up, but they were all looked after eventually. And again, the only trauma that we ever had I'm afraid was with the orthodox Jews. One of the transports arrived on a Saturday and they wouldn't sign for the children and they wouldn't carry their baggage and you can imagine what we felt like. You know, when it was something that seemed to us so unimportant, immaterial, insignificant, but you couldn't let a child go until you had some kind of paperwork to say somebody had got them, and there they were taking the child and no we can't sign it's Saturday. So, I led Mother onto them then and she usually dealt with the situation.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't know but she got them to sign. I don't think she went as far as getting them to carry the baggage, but she certainly got them to sign, but then she was a very formidable lady.</p></p></dialogue>

Why were just those four and those odd hundred present. Were they the ones that had just heard about it. Were they the successful ones? You know, it's very difficult if anybody was really writing it up in serious history. After an enormous amount of research really to find out fundamental what had happened because all that is written and what is done are those people who have come forward if you like, perfectly voluntary, they needn't have done and one doesn't know why the other -- all right there were 100 out of 10,000 of the Germans there. Is it a geographical reason? Is it for some other reason?</p><p>Is it because they had the money because it's jolly expensive to spend three or four days to come to Ft. Lauderdale and pay in the hotel we were.</p><p> So, I would hesitate to draw any standard conclusions really as to the whys and wherefores. All one knows really is that yes, those that we brought out should have been brought out because if they weren't they wouldn't exist. That one knows as the absolute standard and definite fact.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, it's not terribly interesting. I had flown privately so I was a pilot in civil life. I mean I wasn't a pilot professionally but I did fly as a hobby. When I joined up though I couldn't become a pilot because of my eyesight so I became an instructor in what was called the Link, which was a machine teaching pilots night flying. Which was interesting because my knowledge of French I had a lot of French pilots who were expert in low level flying and didn't know where they were when they got into a cloud so the Link was supposed to show them what they did when they got into a cloud and as a thank you they took me low level flying which was pretty hazardous for them. They had two trees they didn't go over them, they went sideways through them. It was very exciting.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, when the war ended I joined the Committee for Refugees in London, thinking it would be having got so many people out from where they should have been it was best to join a place to try to get them back again, and I joined this inter-governmental committee in London which was taken over or became part of it's more accurate to say, the International Refugee Organization in Geneva. We became employed by the International Refugee Organization in Geneva which was one of the specialized agencies of the United Nations and my job there was really nothing to do with the repatriation of refugees. I worked with an American called dealing with the sorting out of all the German loot that had been found in the various caves and everything, false teeth and glasses and bags and fountain pens and everything you could imagine was all crated up and given to us to sort out. Enormous bags and sacks and quantities of watches and alarm clocks, jewelry and we had experts over from America to sort out the jewelry, to find out the real diamonds and the real emeralds and everything from the rubbish and all the jewelry just as one part of the operation was then sent to the in Frankfurt and I had to go there and supervise the sorting out of this again and eventual smelting it down by into gold ingots which I then took to London and sold and the money went to the Jewish Agency because this was just before the Jewish state was founded and it went to a Mr. Kaplan who was the treasurer of the Jewish agency and became the first chancellor of the of Israel. Everything else I took to America where it was auctioned off and again the money sent to Israel -- well the Jewish Agency.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You were based in Geneva?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, I was based in Geneva. I was very little there because I was always either in Frankfurt or taking the stuff across the Atlantic for sale. It's a very big story the story of the liquidation of all the German loot and it's really one of the stories which I don't think has ever been told. Before all this stuff was smelted I had a camera and I took photos of it in the vaults of the in Frankfurt with one bulb and about 20 minute exposures which came out very well and very good pictures of all the jewelry and false teeth and gold evening bags and anything you can imagine that was taken then.</p><p> I remember only one person who really came down into the bank to see what was going on and that was , at the time. I wrote all this up as a matter of fact and it's a big book and that I presented to the , and I've got a copy of everything that was written there, but of course, I haven't got the pictures any more.</p><p>That's an interesting story, very interesting. It tells more than a lot of articles written about the time. You see a picture of a crate of false teeth. You see a picture full of spectacles which we had to smelt down to get the gold out of. Really, it tells more of the story than all kinds of books can tell.</p><p> But as I say, when I went to the to give them the original of that <span class="page-break" number="17"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 9 about the finding and the liquidation of all the stuff that was taken from the Jews at that time.

Presumably they had found out the owners.</p><p>We didn't get things like fur coats and we didn't get anything by carpets. I don't know what they did with them, but I think to start with they tried to find the owners.</p><p> I don't really know, but we got the stuff which obviously needed an enormous amount of work done on it. It couldn't be handled in any other way and for which it was then absolutely impossible to find the owners. But it was a nasty feeling for weeks and weeks and weeks dealing with all of that.

I don't know.</p><p>It's a story which hasn't as I'm saying told since and I don't think there were many people who knew what was going on at that time. I don't think so. I don't know. I don't know.</p><p> I know that of the loot before it came to us there were things that were identifiable and where possible were returned. I've only heard that. I don't know who did it and how it was done. Up to that point it was an army operation. We got the stuff from the army and their brief of what we should do was limited and was regulated by the Paris Reparations Agreement and we had to work under the Paris Reparations Agreement which stated I think it was as most of this stuff belonged to the Jews 95 percent should go to the Jews and I think five percent went to the Christians. So, our job was to get 95 percent of it converted into a way that it could be used and the only way that we could do that was converting it into ingots or taking the good stuff all the good jewelry over to America where it was auctioned.</p></p></dialogue>

When the last transport didn't come and we were told at the time by the Germans that any of the children that we exposed in that way were going to be -- one knew then what was really going on. You can't have all those parents giving up their children without realizing that there was something going on could you? It was certainly evident. You wouldn't give up your child or three or four and stay behind in danger unless you were fairly certain that it was going to be pretty horrible for the child if he stayed there.
