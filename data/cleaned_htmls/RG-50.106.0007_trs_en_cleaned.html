<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember what the feeling of the other people was like and were they frightened? Did they have any idea what was happening?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Off the train there was people we know already. And they put my father and me in a -- in a stable. It was a barracks. The barracks, big old barracks. There were about 60 people at least in there in bunk -- bunk beds. It wasn't a nice side, but there was better than some of the other ones. Some of them were living in worse. They were living in little houses,  <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> </p><p> they were living in one or the other. So my father started working for the transport unloading box cars, and I was playing soccer then.</p></p></dialogue>

We didn't know where they go. They send us out of Theresienstadt. And we came on in September "44 and I think was Yom Kippur even that day, Yom Kippur arrived, maybe, I don't know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>Anyway, we were put on box cars and sent to Auschwitz.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: There was a large group of people?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The whole train. I don't know how many people there were on them, but it was a whole train were sent to Auschwitz.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How was your health at this point?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was young. I was healthy. I was strong. So was my father, too. But the thing when we got out there, you know, Auschwitz, he wore glasses. I didn't wear no glasses then, and had a beard from the train ride and he looked tired. And Mr. Mengele was standing there at the train, we had to go in lines, and Dr. Mengele, left and right. My father went to the right, I went to the left. And I said, "This is my father. I want to go with him." This man, he had a whip and he whipped me with my bag and I was running to the left. So from that date on, that was the end of my father. I never saw my father again. And I found out there was a fire, I think it was a fire, yeah, smokestacks. And I said, "What is it?" Somebody told me that's -- they burn the bricks, until I find out -- it was really messy and stinky, you know. So what it was, it was the crematorium.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you get any food during that time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We had still food on us. But the worst part was I was voluntary -- they was looking for people, I never got the tut (ph). I was only stamped like an animal. And I was voluntary to Buchenwald. I said to myself I wanted to get out of hell, because what was going on there, I can't even say all that. I said go away from here. I want to get out, just out of here.</p><p>So when a group of Viennese people, about 50, we got voluntary to Buchenwald. But we never came to Buchenwald, we came to Kaufering.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Well, now, wait a minute.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was it all men?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't remember. I think we were all men. No, no, we were mixed. From Auschwitz away we were all men.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="11"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And then you got to Auschwitz and you said you were separated from your father and that was the last time you saw him.

My hair was shaved and they took all the clothes away, everything I had they took away and gave me the striped uniforms. And then we were sent to one of those mogs (ph). And we were sitting, I don't know, a week. And they asked for volunteers for Buchenwald. So I said let's go to Buchenwald. And then when we left there, it was September 2, and we left and went over in cattle cars again.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. How many -- how many people went with you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: There were about 50. In half a thing, half a box car only, because the other half were the SS in there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: These were young people like you?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: They did not give you any food that week?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: When they carried the food through the block, people coming out, they kill them, they shoot them. But they were going under with the food container and robbed the food container. So the most of them was in the underground. Before they come to the block, they had no food. But when we left there, they gave us a piece of bread. One loaf of bread, actually, not a piece, a loaf of bread, a piece of sausage and a piece of cheese.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Each person?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Each person, right. Till I get to the box car I had no more bread, I had no more sausage, I had no more cheese.
