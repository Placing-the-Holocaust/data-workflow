And Mr. Mengele was standing there at the train, we had to go in lines, and Dr. Mengele, left and right. My father went to the right, I went to the left. And I said, "This is my father.

But when we left there, they gave us a piece of bread. One loaf of bread, actually, not a piece, a loaf of bread, a piece of sausage and a piece of cheese.</p></p></dialogue>
