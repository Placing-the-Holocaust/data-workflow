And I had two rabbis, because one rabbi was the Hebrew language, another was Jewish. And then we had in Slobodka a rabbinical seminary. The biggest rabbinical seminary in the world, because in that time, in 1914, -17, the only thing they knew is to learn the bible. The people was poor. There was nothing to eat.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q:What year was this?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A:It was in 1932. And then one day it was -- it was a lucky moment with the courts. I had to get a job already. Jay was born and I got married, I had to make a living. My father was poor. And I took a job as accountant and worked in a big concern (ph). And I worked there, and one of my buddies, my friends from college, he recognized me that I came to the government bank to pay a bill, I don't remember, for the company I work through, because the company asked me to make a deposit and I'm paying. That he was a Lithuanian. He worked with chief of police. But he also went to the college. He come to me and say, "Ipson, look. I got something." My name was Ipson. Iposon (ph) in Lithuanian. "I got something -- good news for you. Don't tell nobody, but I can give you a tip now." Lithuanian didn't have any mechanical business, like cars, trucks, machinery.</p><p>It was a poor farm country, like 87 percent of the Lithuanians was farmer. Then they didn't have nothing. And now already the countries like -- like now the Balkans, already they are Czechoslovakia started in their time, Bulgaria. Here no one with fighting with all that stuff. And Hitler's told this Czechoslovakian, told the League of Nations -- was in at that time. Like the United Nations, it was the League of Nations. He told the League of Nations that he wanted Czechoslovakia, said that Czechoslovakia was his. And that start already in that time beginning all the fights. But -- and I worked at the factory -- at the company as accountant. And another one came to me, also. He say that's what me a good job to be is the distributor of Belgian-made motorcycles.

They divided Europe in two halves: half Hitler and half Stalin. And they divided that between themselves, and we didn't have nothing but what we had in the bank. We lost everything. Stalin took away all the few pennies which we got it together. And I went on a trip to Belgium because of the fact that they asked me. They want I should could come there. They want to talk with me about a new contract. Because I am doing good and all that, I had to go to Berlin. And I came in Berlin. I have relatives. My mother had a aunt living in Berlin, and she was a beautiful girl. And the owner, her son, from the tobacco factory -- who was a <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> businesses, took away the bank accounts. Anything they had, they lost it. Then we stopped going. And then Hitler -- I mean Churchill used to -- on shortwave radio used to and tell Stalin, "Be careful, Stalin, you're going to lose your head." And then, "Your good friend Stalin is getting prepared to fight you." And this was Ribbentrop. Stalin sent his secretary of state Ribbentrop and -- no, the Hitler sent Ribbentrop and Stalin sent Molitof (ph). Molitof was for Stalin. They had been getting together one against the other keeping -- they didn't know what was going on until Churchill got into the act and started World War IL.</p></p></dialogue>

It was unbelievable, that we didn't even -- I had a big opportunity to go, but I was already married. I had a little child. Jay was four at that time, and I -- my hand was tied. I still say, oh, it still not so bad. It still only right now who is closed (ph) is the poor little Jews, and the poor little Jews used to come to Lithuanian to find a place of where to hide, where to live. And I was in that time a young lawyer. I still could take cases, but I -- but they used to come to me. They open up a office in Vilnius. Vilnius is the capital city of Poland right now, too.

But they had to get a visa, a visa from the Jewish Council. And they find out about me, and, you know, some of them had money to pay for my work and some of them didn't have any money even. There was -- or they moved -- or the council moved away to Latvia -- Riga was the capital for Latvia -- ran away there. I had to go over with them to help them there. It was -- it was rough. But I still had my home. I didn't have to worry about Hitler, nothing. Only the Polish Jew had the problem. That we knew through them that it's no good. They came from Russia or from all this stuff -- the old timers, little towns, come from all over, run into Lithuanian to become a place where to live.</p></p></dialogue>

He didn't have the right to give, but he give it the visa. Nobody knows he gave out -- about 5,000 visas he gave out. It was not legal. If it was legal to travel, it was legal to receive it. But his government didn't told him he should give visas, but at the same time his government also keep a closed eye, didn't see nothing what's coming at all.

And -- now I remember, the name of Silver come up a day before and took away the wrong -- the visa with -- the men had to get it, and he got it, the visa, and went to Japan.

Run into them, "What you going to do? Are you going by train? Are you going by boat? How are you going to run away?" People got confused. You wouldn't believe it. You know, "What's happening?" Hitler dropped two bombs. One bomb they dropped right over the railroad bridge. It's they wanted the bridge to be destroyed.</p><p>Another one they dropped right by Slobodka. There was a big field, that" what all the selection was, those who live and those who die. Then -- then people didn't know what to do. And I was working in that time in the transportation company. Worked with the transportation horse and buggies. Around 50 horse and buggies, I don't know, got together, and I was their secretary, organized the horse and buggy transportation committee, and we made a living from that. It's as long you were a tail (ph), you went in the system from Stalin, Stalin was happy.

And if you had a street, you would go.</p><p>You will go the long street, go from the bridge going on the way -- there was a way going you could go to Moscow. If you go to Moscow and you got a car and you can go fast, I can understand. But here, they are going with little children, pushing children's carts, pushing to Moscow. But from Moscow -- from Kovno to Moscow was 1175 miles, and they going with horse and buggy. And they'll never can reach there, because here was already flying the Germans airplanes dropping them over the walking people and killing people in the street. You could see here, boom, right lane already send people been killed going to Moscow. They couldn't go nowhere. You had to turn around and go back home. We had no choice.

I was the owner -- the, not the owner. The owner was Stalin.</p><p>And I went there and I took him. There was nobody. "Where is the manager?" The manager took also one and he run away. Then I took that horse and buggy, and I went on the way to Moscow, but went until 50 miles I had to turn around and go back. Then I go in back, Edna tells me -- my wife tells me, "I got to have milk for the girl." I went out to the farmer house and I talk with the farmer and his wife, see if they can sell me some milk. They sold me some milk. And they said, "Where are you going?" I say, "I am going to Kaunas." "Don't go," they tell me, "Don't go. They're killing Jews, and they going to kill you. You stay away from this road." The farmer -- I was lucky -- they told me. And I told to Edna, I say, "You know, Edna, we better go with the bad streets, second way road, not to go with the highway. The highway we'll go, we'll get running in with the people taking to the fortress where they're killing Jews. Isn't that the way -- we start going to the worser place. Not to go for the highway, but to go where the second -- second grade road. And that saved our life. And we came in Slobodka. I see my father</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Well, after the pograms and after the Lithuanians got happy and killed the Jews, they decide, the Germans, to get over, and the Germans start get bringing more to order, because they find out that way, the way the Lithuanians went, they'll never accomplish nothing, and it would be bad for the Jews and bad for the Lithuanians. They got -- they got to get it straight, and it's what they started to straighten them up. And then we decided to run out of ghetto. One night I got Jay ready and talked to Edna, talk to him a couple times. But he was a kid, five years. I got to get him in his mind that he should listen, because we were afraid to take and do something. And the only way we could take him out from the ghetto was to put him in -- in the small ghetto was a place where they run -- people been running out from the small ghetto to the big ghetto. And that's the way they survived, together they run out in the part of Lithuania in the fields, in the woods. Oh, but Hitler decided he got to kill every one, and Himmler gave the victory order to get the Jews locked up and get rid of them, to have the Ninth Fortress, and they got to kill them. The first thing they done is get a order that the Jews not allowed to walk the sidewalk. They got to use the gutter. They walk in the gutter. The Jews, the second decree -- Hitler was in Golub's book, I think, saying the same thing. The second degree was when the Jews got to wear the star of David on the front and in the back. Why on both sides when the one side would be enough? They say, no, when they see a Jew they got to kill him. That is a point where they set up the shotgun or the rifle to -- star of David, to kill him. And a Jew doesn't have the right to have a car. They took away the cars from them. A Jew don't have the right to have a secretary, to have an accountant to work for him. Nothing. And it was rough. But -- and the Jew -- and the main thing, they got to go to work at the airport. And we'll pick them up 7:00 o'clock in the mrning every day and take them to the airport to work. And it was also the airport there to work. It's Jordan, he was the one in that time. He was Miller, the head from the Gestapo, he was his assistant. And Avraham Tory worked also with the same Miller.</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q:Okay. I just wanted to clarify a few points you made earlier. You talked about trying to get out of Lithuania in the very beginning when the Germans came in and how you were able to get horses and buggies and all of this, even though it didn't work. Why is -- did everybody have that opportunity?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A:No. You see, when the war -- on a Sunday morning, the Germans were commencing to drop two bombs: the one on the way to the bridge and another one right close to the ghetto.</p><p>And they were what scared the living out of many people. This special bomb must be such a blast that everybody not run out -- fall out from bed and come running out outside.</p><p>And didn't know what to do, had the people like crazy. It maybe was thousand people in the street waiting for a solution. Somebody said "Help them." Even it got so confused is when the younger couples who was, where they only had to go to the railroad station.</p><p>The communists kept a train at the train station for almost a full day begging everybody to go in the train and go to Moscow. They want to -- they are willing to carry them to Moscow, and the train was staying there. And they wait and they didn't go and they didn't use their opportunity and they got killed. You see, other ones went with horse and buggy. Where they got the horse and buggy? They had a cooperative, a cooperative, to tell the Russian people. They had to tell what all the private horse and buggy people.</p><p>Like I got uncles, my three uncles, they were owners. The horse and buggy they want only to belong to the cooperative, because they were afraid for the Russians. They say who -- those who work, those who eat. And they were so scared that they don't go get any food, that they board a horse and buggy and joined up into the transportation cooperation that they should say that they got some work and they been doing work. And</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And how is me by being educated? And I got my two uncles, three uncles, right in the board of that cooperation. Through their influence, I been accepted on the job to be their bookkeeper. Then I went carrying their books, and I got calls, people been calling in. They want to bring -- they found each other, they want to bring up a safe on first floor, on the second floor, all that kind of work. They used to call mein. I used to give it all to the dispatchers, and they used to do the work. And then it's the way we've been working with the transportation. With me, if you had a place like a stable, a lot stable, which we kept about 30 horses with wagons, and people were running to that place there for a horse and the wagon. They go off with the horse and wagon. Was going to Moscow, going to save himself in Moscow. Going 1800 miles, go over in the horse and wagon. They didn't realize they what foolishness they were trying to do, but when a person is scared and the devil is after him and chasing him, they don't have no choice. They do a lot of things what is not real for a regular person. But they done it. The Germans were on top flying over the heads with the little planes. Lithuania only had two paper cups, I call it, two of them. They didn't have any more. It was a poor nation. That's all they had. They had eggs plenty, chickens, turkey.</p><p>That kind of items they have: food to eat. And that's what they struggle even right now, here right at the present time, with the and all what's going on. There the <span class="page-break" number="24"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 7 the Jewish nation. The Jews done so much good for them. And even right now they been going and asking in Israel for help, because they got to go to France, they got to go to England, they got to go the States, seeing that to recognize their independence, to recognize them as a nation. I one time came to the German Council in Richmond, and I was right at a meeting speaking to us, and I ask him a question. I say, "Would you tell me what's happened to Kennicksburg (ph)?" Kennicksburg is one of the largest cities in north Germany, and there was a population of around 5 million German, and the Lithuanians took in maybe 5 million Germans. It wouldn't be a Lithuania. And the problem is -- the United Nations all have problems how to get it straight again. It's headaches -- Europe is in problems.</p></p></dialogue>

He was the President Smetona's good friend. And anything -- when he had to write a letter or something or something to ask the President Smetona for help, he used to come to me and ask me I should write him in the Lithuania language a letter. Or when he used to send a letter to Roosevelt right in the States, he used to come also to me and ask me to help him to write in English, even when I didn't know the English language. He didn't took "No" for an answer. I say, "Your own sister-in-law works for Shell," Shell company, the gasoline. I say, "Why don't you go to your own sister-in-law? She can help you more in this case than I can." But he didn't want to. He want me. And I couldn't help him. To satisfy him I say maybe I'll -- maybe he's an ordinary person who got feelings. I'll go. What am I going to lose? More so than the death, it couldn't be. And I went. And I went to the side streets. I know to the university was right there. Then I used to go every night and knew the places where to go. I went, but I almost got my head cut off.</p></p></dialogue>

It matter was a good little corner where there is room in the living, can serve you a loaf of bread for a -- a two pair of stockings for a woman. Or earrings, with a golden earing. You see, when also the Germans come out with the decree, they want to have the Jewish people should give all their gold, jewelry, and diamonds, to turn it in into the central committee.

Then some of them -- one was my father-in-law. Took out a brick from the wall, and done such a beautiful job that you couldn't tell. He put in his gold _ watch, he putting in -- his wife had a chain, a golden chain around her neck that's plain solid gold.</p><p>He took that and put it all in the hole from the brick, and put it over with tape, taped it up, and you couldn't even tell. And it come up after we come after we got liberated, we went and got to find the gold pieces right in the wall where he put it in. And then it was -- well, this is one item. And then we went and then to go to work at the airport -- no, it was the second time, then the Germans decided they got to have the airport still done, with the company, it was a German company, been building the airport. And everybody had to go to work regardless. It took all the brigades and turn around and send all of them to the airport delivering gravel to help the airport done. And they done it in a hurry, in no time, but they work day and night. And one brigade I work at night, I cut my fingers off.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A:Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q:Did anyone help them or did they just sort of come over there and find places?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A:No. It was like one went to the other neighbor or a friend whom he knew or a friend who came in and swapped the houses, swapped rooms. It been swapping. "Here you take mine in the comers, and I'll take you what you outside out by the field." They been swapping between theirself, and nobody helped them and nobody bothered them. It was a big mistake and it was a big mess. Everybody was running, doing anything they can to help theirself or help the other one. It didn't work. Then they stop it. Started -- and they find out that they don't have enough space. They got to have a bigger, larger ghetto.</p><p>They had one large ghetto and they had one small ghetto. The small ghetto was 5,000 Jews, and the large ghetto was 27,000 Jews. And to go in the small one, they didn't have enough more room, since a lot of Jews were -- because Germany decided to send Jews from Austria, to send Jews from other countries, to Lithuania, to Kaunas, to the Ninth Fortress, that killed the Jews, and it was the selection. And they build a bridge from one ghetto to the other, from the small one to the big one. And in the big one they still have room to put in, but in the small ghetto they didn't have no more. And I -- what they done, they told everybody, all small and big, say, "Go out in the large field." It was where they were building the airport. It's where they have the -- what they call it? Rockstaten (ph), the work places. And they all been sent there. But there they got a select, and the name -- a German soldier by the name of Rauca -- Jay got his picture of a writeup with him.</p><p>He was the head of the selection. And he had the help of the Lithuanians. They helped to guard so the Jews shouldn't run. And they was directing the Selection A and B, big</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And then after everybody come around and stay there all morning. I will never forget. From 5:00 o'clock in the morning until 10:00 o'clock at night without food, without water, without nothing. Andit was little children, sick people, unbathed. It was a terrible picture, seeing the way they been mistreating. Mistreating -- the people wanted they should be shot, but they didn't -- surrounded them with machine guns around the all -- around the ghetto, and they kept them all day. And then Rauca come around with a little stick, like you would play music, play an orchestra, directing all what to do, and asked everybody's occupation, everybody's name. And then after a while, we seen a German on a motorcycle come running and told Rauca something. And Rauca gave the order, "Everybody home. We don't need it. Go home." Well, they were trying to, the Germans, to find out how much time and what kind of power it will take to control a situation like this, because they were afraid for the balance of the Jews. After all, about 40,000 or even 30,000 Jews, it's a lot of people. They cannot take and 40,000 and shoot them out. Somebody will get ahold of guns and somebody will get ahold of machine guns, and in worse cases like that it's not so shameful. Well, then they send everybody back. And what the religious Jews was say, they were saying, "Here is a God" -- I mean "the hand of God. God saved the Jews." And they all -- they all go and -- and we all Jews start praying, and God is the one. Jews, you listen, and all that. The orthodox, and they were so happy. "You see, we still have a God. God saved us." And I remember it like today they been saying. And they send us back home. And this was the small ghetto was liquidated, but they had a bridge made.</p><p>The bridge to bring in the Jews from the small ghetto to the large ghetto, all the same time from the large one to the small one, and started Selection Number""2. The big selection, which was October" 28th, 1941. That's when they had the big selection. And, again, comes the case, I am with all my family, with my family and with Edna's family, all together.

And it was not one, it was a bunch of police looking, because I was the dangerous one. Dangerous than the partisans, because partisans was living right there too in those woods, in the woods. It was thick woods and good____, and it what the partisans need. They live in there. And it's the way we moved up to the Paskavitzes. Edna knocks in the window, and "Who's there?" And Edna say -- mentioned her mother's name. "Don't know her." The old man comes up to the door, opens it a crack, and say, "Who you?" And she tells him she is Esther's -- Esther's daughter, and she want to talk with him. "Esther's daughter? Which Esther are you talking about?" Say "Esther from Slobodka, from Lithuania, that is my mother. And I am Hikki (ph)," they call it, yeah, "I am Hikki's daughter." "Oh, Hikki's daughter." They know who it is. They let us in home, she and her husband. Her son, second son died.</p><p>They had a daughter and a son. The son did not investigated what goes on in the village, because they knew each other. Every movement. Anything in a little village they knew.</p><p>Then he went out that night to report the mother and father what's happening in the village. And they come back the next day and reported that the Gestapo was looking for -- spent two hours checking, searching around the lake, although they had a round lake, and couldn't find them. Couldn't find nobody. And they dissolve it. They decided to move in another time. They didn't . Two days they come again.

For woods they were afraid, because they know with the underground is no place to play. They when they do a job, they do it. They blew up five train loads with soldiers right in this section.</p><p>It was a very worthwhile section for the underground, that even Moscow had been sending the partisans by plane in those sections. Well, and when we came to them, we could stay only three weeks and we had to move out again. Had it rough. That moving is terrible. Why we had to move? It was right before Christmas, and before Christmas all the families had got together for the holidays, and the people were laying there in a big bottom covered up in straw and hay, and we were afraid that the kids, that two small kids were came also, that they'll start getting noisy, and going up in the in daytime, they <span class="page-break" number="62"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 9 ammunition. And where they would find the ammunition? Right by the farmers. The farmers used to sell the ammunition. They used to come in, and -- the partisans, and to the farmers, and have the names and have everything they already knew also their investigation, through their investigation, what's happening. But Paskofski had two potato peats. And a potato -- you know what a potato peat? Ninety percent of the people don't know, never heard of it, they don't know what it is. But a potato peat, there we used to lay. I was one cuple days in the barn sleeping there. I wasn't safe. I couldn't sleep. I was scared all the time. Maybe somebody's coming in. And then I mostly staying right there. And then Paskofski also have a German shepherd, a dog, smart like a -- called him Vilgas (ph). I gave him a name Vilgas. Vilgas means wolf. And I been talking to him and eating together from one plate, bring him up and hand the bones, for the farmer had bones left over. Why, sometimes I went out with him to get soliciting help, soliciting food from the farmers. I used to go with Edna's uncle. He knew everybody. He knew where to go in and where to stay away from; which house there was a friend, and if there was an enemy right there; to know where to go, to watch their step and not to go. That's why we succeed, because Edna's uncle knew everything. Every step we do he say, "Don't worry. Come back." We used to come in the morning, he say, "You go and do your job." L say. "What's your job? He say, "Kill the lice." I hate for -- shower for months. <span class="page-break" number="63"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 0 crawling faster. But I was scared to death that it could collapse. I didn't have any support. I put in a few branches, but that's all. And I said the ground could -- the sand could fell and killed the kids. And then I would be in trouble; they would be all over us dead. It was rough. And Edna, when you say that Jay listen to me. He had to listen.</p><p>And I told them, every one of them, that I am the boss. That they should know not play around, not to run around, because our lives depend on it. Finally the kids, after they understood I was right, they already been controlling theirself. When somebody been talking a little louder, the other kids would say, "You shut up. You keep quiet." And at night we used to go out and get some bread. And then when in day, in daytime, well, the woman got to go out after all, say person cannot be all the time, we have empty stomach.</p><p>And then we had to a fix up for that, too. A big bucket with all that outside and cover it up with potatoes, rotten, rotten potatoes. I made it that way that the rotten potatoes was high, and I'd been pulling with a string to opens it up a little opening, and all the rotten potatoes fills up the hole that you couldn't see the entrance And people been coming.</p><p>First thing, the dog used to take care of a lot of things. Never did let nobody to come in close by. I've been training him so that I didn't give him the bones unless he go and fix it up, get himself a place -- I did a job. I had some fun. And it worked. I've been talking to him like to a person, and he believes me. And I'm staying one evening, and I used to go out to fix the peats. It was around 10:00 o'clock at time and all the farmers are asleep, and I shouldn't get in any troubles by staying and digging. I wasn't careful enough, and it collapse on me. The sand from the _ peats got together in one spot and got wrapped to here in sand. It was terrible. I couldn't move. The first time I understood what it means being covered up with sand that is unable to move away nothing. I was staying in one spot. I couldn't even move a hand. Nothing. I couldn't even breathe, getting harder and harder to breathe. Vilgas was right with me. And I told Vilgas, "I'm in troubles. Go and bring me Paskofski. Go and bring me Paskofski." And I showed him a bone, and it cooked. And he come to get for a bone. I took the bone. "You go and bring him and</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

I been talking to him like I talk to a person. Anytime after I have a lesson with a dog, the dog takes off. Where he goes, I don't know. I told him, I said, "Go to the old man," the owner, the farmer. I said, "Wake him up." But he didn't.</p><p>What's happened, the farmer had a son, Stasook (ph). His name's Stacese (ph). That's he used to go -- every weekend go in the farm places, the music with ghettos, and go in there to dance and carry on. And passing by every time, automatically he used to pass by the peat. See how the dog didn't bother him. He knew him very well. And the dog seen Stasook Stacese coming up, and he jumped right on him and start pushing him. His paw back, and should go front, and said go to the peat. And Stacese understood something in trouble. "Who's in trouble? Tell me," he asked the dog. And the dog grabbed him from his coat, the coat, the side, and pulled me up to the hole to the peats where I been laying, and he dug me out. And I could move. I was a feeling like I got from dead to alive. It was a terrific. And I got out. Then he say, "Well, they'll make a meal." "Okay. We make a meal. I'll pay for it." We got a pig, and we had to smoke some for Jay. He loved Jay, give him something to eat. And that's the way we got out for a while. Now, the war came to Vilnius, and Vilnius from the place where the army, the Russian army was around 75 miles. And a week later, I seen the oldier. The soldier going clear up without a , with holes, with all that. And Paskofski tell me. he say. "It's a Russian solder. <span class="page-break" number="65"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 2 and they don't know one from each other. But finally they come up, and he was one of the Jewish captain. And I told him who I am, how I come here, and what's is here, and who's Paskofki. And to be sure, he asked me a certain prayer, a Jewish prayer. I said, say, it's a song, it's -- the captain, Russian captain say, "I repeat it." I say, "All right. You okay. Now I know you're not the enemy. I am not afraid for you. You're not do me any harm." And he say, "Where are you going?" And I tell him I want to go -- the first thing to go to the ghetto to see maybe somebody from my family is alive.</p></p></dialogue>

And there is a lot of woods, and it's the only place we had to pick, because the Germans was afraid for the woods. The woods is a trap for them. They were scared to death. When they already were in the woods and you seen a German group, even a battalion, could be 500, you don't have to worry about it. They don't go fight. They scared. They look for another place for to run. And it's what happened also with them. And we were -- every time we heard -- we heard a shot, we were jumping for joy, because we seen here is Hitler getting beat and here we -- our time to be free is so close that you just touch it. And he already seen the Russians plane right over our head. You see that Paskofski had a lake, there's a lake on his land. And we went there to swim and to lay in the sun. It was foolish of us, too.

I had to make a plan, and hey let him out. And then I got Paskofski out. I say, "Don't go out. I'll take you back." And it's 50 miles almost. I took him back. And anyway, I got Paskofski. Now Stasook, his son, he's the one that start the troubles. He told the neighbors that is the refugees running and hiding in here. They been there and they messed it up and he get blamed. But they took him in the army.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q:Well, I was asking you if when you were in hiding before the liberation you had contact with any of the partisans in the area. Did you ever run across them?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A:Yeah, run across them, but it wasn't much. They -- they -- in that area, they used to come regular routine to get food.

They told him they go pay when you want to go pay, but you got to have food to eat and they got a lot of children, and it was a lot of groups, big groups. And then the farmer wasn't so anxious to give, and he told him a couple times, I say, "They don't want any monkey business. They want food. They're not -- they'll take it alone. When they'll take, they'll take everything that goes." And they settled and they gave them food to eat. And it wasn't such terrible. But they were ready to fight with what killed a lot of them. The -- not the Lithuanians -- not the Germans, but the Lithuanians. The Lithuanians say, "Woods doesn't mean nothing, because they live in the woods. The Germans didn't go.
