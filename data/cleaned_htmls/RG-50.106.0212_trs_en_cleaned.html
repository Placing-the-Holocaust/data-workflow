We're still researching and they were very well, how can I put it, friendly with all the families. Every family knew each other, not only the parents, but also the children and the grandparents. So it was a very nice knit Jewish community.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: This is what I want to tell you. I was in public school in the Bronx. One of 35 kids in a classroom. I'm a teacher so that I can tell you from the educational point of view it wasn't a kind of educational situation for a child that just came out of the Holocaust. I had a number on my hand. In those days in New York they never taught the Holocaust. It wasn't mandated like in the state of New Jersey. And the kids looked at the number. And they said Sarah what's that number on your hand. And I said well let me tell you I was in the Holocaust in Germany. And the Germans put this number on me. I wasn't Sarah Racimora. I was this number. That's how they referred to me. You talking crazy. There was no such thing as the Holocaust. New York never taught the Holocaust. This was 1954. Those kids were never educated, never heard the word Holo -- what's Holocaust. Well I didn't like to talk about it. And I went to my parents and <span class="page-break" number="22"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Sarah Ludwig 26 August 29, 2013 I said you know what, I have to have this number removed. Because I am just too inundated with questions that I cannot answer. So we went to Montefiore hospital. They got a surgeon and unfortunately the surgeon got sick and they brought someone else. Did a lousy job of this. This should have been just a thin strip. And that's why I have a scar here. I had it removed. I felt better because the kids stopped talking about it. I went to my education in New York, finished high school and then I met my husband.</p><p>How did I meet my husband? I went to Moodus, Connecticut. Did you ever hear of that place?</p><p>It was a place where young people were able to meet young Jewish young men. And I went with a friend of mine. I took courses at Hunter College. And then we went for a week to Moodus, Connecticut to meet some guys. We got there and we didn't meet anyone the whole week. And then I said, Sunday we were supposed to leave. We had a cab take us there. So I said to my friend, Brenda, I said you know I'm hungry. Let's go to the dining room. I feel like a salami sandwich. So we went down and I stood on line and this, there was a young man there. He says hi, how are you? What are you ordering? I said a salami sandwich. He says me too. He says I'm here with my friends. He came with four or five of his friends from New Jersey. They were ready to meet young people. He says why don't you come over to the table and sit with us, get your sandwich. So Brenda and I got a sandwich. We sat down with them. And we got to talking and he says, where are you from? You have an accent. I said well I'm from Israel. He says you from Israel. He said yes you have an accent. I said well can you understand me. I can still speak English. He made a derogatory comment about Israel and I was very angry. I'm a rebel. I picked up the bottle of wine and I was ready to with the bottle. My husband Billy, later on we got married, grabbed my hand and he says put that bottle down. He's not worth it. Well we sat there and spent the evening with his friends. We had a very nice evening. And then the next day we were leaving Moodus, Connecticut. Dana lodge. I don't think it exists anymore. And Billy says you know what I'Il take you home. Where do you live? I said I live in the Bronx right across the street from Yankee stadium. Oh, he says, I know that area, don't worry. I'll get you home safe. So Brenda took the cab home cause we paid for that and he took me home. And that's the history. After that it was a romance. We dated for a year or so. He says you know what I really want you to move to New Jersey. You can continue education. So I switched colleges and I went to Newark State, was a teaching college. Now it's Kean University and I finished my education there, got my degree from, certified in New Jersey, kindergarten through eighth grade.

There was a very nice woman living next to us in the apartment house and she said she was willing to take care of Debby while I went to work. My husband says no one is going to take over my daughter. You stay home. So I had to give up teaching. And I stayed home and I raised my daughter. Later on we saved enough money. We lived in the Village for quite a while.</p><p>We lived there I think ten years. And we bought a house in Livingston, New Jersey, a very affluent community, a Jewish community. And we're there now over 40 years. My daughter lives in Renalopin [ph]. She has two children, boys. They are now in college at University of Indiana. They both decided to go to the same college. Cody is a senior. Tyler is a freshman. She just took off to class. She's not even home. And my son became a spinal surgeon in Baltimore, has a very nice group of doctors. Does a lot of traveling throughout the world, educating other doctors in orthopedic surgery. He went to China, he went to Japan. He does a lot of traveling.</p><p>And he has two children, Katy the little princess. Katy is now 11. Ethan is 13. And they both go to private schools because the Baltimore school system is not that great so they're both in two different schools. They're not in the same school. Katy goes to an all-girls school where my daughter in law graduated from. And Ethan is in a school from, very big school from kindergarten through high school. And the whole school, money was donated by Jewish families.</p><p>How do I know? Every building has a Jewish name. We went to visit the school to see where Ethan was. They have a very nice life. Now they're traveling by bikes. They are in Switzerland and going through all the other countries, going to be away for two weeks so I won't see them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Let's talk a little bit about your story. Do you think about your war time experiences, the Holocaust more now that so many years have passed, or do you feel is it less?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Absolutely. For a very long time I was busy with my career, raising my kids. And I just put everything aside. I didn't want to think about it. My father brought the video, after he made a video with Steven Spielberg. He showed it to my children. We spoke about it and whenever dad came to visit me in New Jersey. He lived in New York at that time, my mother had died. He remarried a Holocaust survivor, the second wife. And he used to visit so everything else was fine. And we didn't discuss it that much. Years later, recently I picked up and I said I have to do <span class="page-break" number="24"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Sarah Ludwig 28 August 29, 2013 something about it. And this is why I ended up being a teacher, being involved in teaching about the Holocaust.</p><p>I learned from my father's video which I know you have a copy of that here, the whole story how he saved me. And this was the basic of my foundation for these PowerPoint sessions. I contacted my good friend, Elizabeth Bess who was the principal at a very prestigious reformed temple and we got together and we wrote this program. And now what we're doing, we are managing to go out and talk about the Holocaust in a very, very educational way. And also in a creative way.</p><p>The children learn about it. Walking out of one of these sessions that they can go home and say to their parents, this is what we're doing.</p><p>A lot of people in the United States, even though they belong to a synagogue, they're not that educated on the Holocaust. So this is what we're doing now. That's why we came out here, Elizabeth and I to seek more information. We found out a lot of information yesterday as I told you about my family. And we're rewriting the whole curriculum for the Holocaust. Programs that we're going to be doing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you think you were at an advantage being so young and not remembering as opposed to if you had been older during the Holocaust?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I can't tell you. It would just be a guess. My whole survival is I use the word when I speak to my students, it was Bashert. A lot of them don't know the word. It's a Yiddish word and I said I guess I was chosen to survive to tell the story, to come here and teach you about the Holocaust.</p><p>So you can share it with your parents. Many of these children are not Jewish, where we go. We go to many affluent day schools. Some of them are Jewish, some aren't. Some don't know anything about the Holocaust. But the main thing that Elizabeth and I see is that we are reaching that population. When they walk out of one of our sessions they say Sarah, we learned so much today that we didn't know before. I had them write an evaluation. We went, I don't know if you're familiar with the Princeton Day School in New Jersey, very affluent school. My cousin's daughter teaches there which is a big plus also. She set her class up for us to give our spiel.</p><p>The kids were mesmerized. They walked out. They wrote evaluation. What did they want to know the most? Tell us more stories about your father. You, exactly what happened. <span class="page-break" number="25"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Sarah Ludwig 29 August 29, 2013 They loved the story when he put me in a potato sack and he threw me there. What happened to you? Did you survive? I said I did tell them the story. It was very personal and we are getting very successful with it. We work very hard.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you think it could happen again?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Absolutely. Betsy and I were just discussing it. Absolutely.

There are no quotas now.</p><p>Anyone can come into the United States unfortunately.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p>Did that bring up feelings for you of the war time?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no. I separated myself, psychologically, I was the mother of children born in the United States.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah but I meant for instance when they were two and when they were four you were going through such terrible times yourself, did that, it did not bring it up?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I never discussed it with them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: No, I didn't mean discuss it but did it bring up emotionally you know when I was two, when I was four. This is what happened</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, no, no. I just set it aside.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How much did you tell them when they were growing up about your experience?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well it didn't come to discussing the Holocaust until my father was interviewed by Steven Spielberg. And my father came to the house. He still lived in New York and showed my father's <span class="page-break" number="27"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Sarah Ludwig 31 August 29, 2013 interview and that's when they really learned. | think at that time I think Debby and Steve and they were maybe fourth or fifth graders.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Nothing before that, they knew nothing about your life.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Your war time life?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. Well they knew that I was born in Poland. You know and during the war they knew that.</p><p>Just that. They didn't ask me details. You know then of course as they got older they studied it and they knew what was happening. Later on they asked me questions when they got older.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Are there any sights or sounds or smells that bring back memories of the war time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well I'll tell you the traveling in those cattle cars.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I was just going to say for instance--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes, that absolutely.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But are there any sounds today or smells today that trigger that experience?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, not really. No, no. Oh, dogs yes. Iam fearful of dogs. Thank you Betsy.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You're fearful of dogs?

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you think you would have been a different person today if you hadn't had the childhood that you had?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Absolutely I'm sure, I'm sure.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In what sense?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In what sense? Well I would have been brought up completely differently you know. I wouldn't have missed all those young years. You know that I missed. You know, being fearful, remembering that I had to hide under the bed. I wouldn't experience that. It probably would have been a more positive kind of growing up to be very honest. A happier growing up, not being fearful what would happen. Not being cautious. It would have been a completely different story, absolutely.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How has this affected you spiritually, religiously?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well religiously once my father made the tape with Steven Spielberg, he came back to Judaism. He used to go to shul when he lived in Florida. Every Saturday morning he gathered a couple of his friends. They got in the car. They went to services. Holidays he loved to observe. I used to make all the holidays you know and he used to come to my house and we celebrated all the holidays. There was the pinnacle of happiness. He remembered, he used to say, remember when your grandmother made this, you know. His memories came back. My grandfather the same thing too. I mean Passover was beautiful because my grandfather had a beautiful voice.</p><p>And at the end of the Seder we used to sit with the Haggadah and he used to sing the songs. My kids still remember that. Debby said to me the other day. I remember when great grandpa was singing all these songs from the Haggadah. He had a beautiful voice.

I haven't heard anything yet.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Are you more comfortable around survivors?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I have nothing to do with, I mean with the survivors it was only my father's friends.</p><p>When I used to come.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: What did I learn?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I learned that it could happen again. That don't look away and say that happened many years ago. You lived through it. You survived it. You were able to come to the Holocaust museum and tell your story. I am not that sure that it wouldn't happen again to be very honest with you. The way the world is going now. Unfortunately. I'm very pessimistic to be very honest with you.</p><p>To see there are no quotas to come into the United States. We had to wait all that time you know to come here after the Holocaust. Roosevelt had a quota for, for the Polish quota. There's no quotas. Anyone can come in. The borders are open. All you hear on tv and anywhere that you go, all the atrocities that are happening unfortunately. Every day it's anew gimmick. Robbing people, killing people. The world is terrible now and I'm very sad about it.</p></p></dialogue>
