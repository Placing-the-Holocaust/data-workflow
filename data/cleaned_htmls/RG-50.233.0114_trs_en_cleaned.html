<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Report card or a transcript?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I don't know how they -- maybe you don't have it. Anyhow, I still have it at home and the best grades whatever students can get, she had. I'm very proud of her, excellent professors she had. Unfortunately, when they married, it was in 1914, the war came. After the war, it was impossible to have jobs. A Jewish couple couldn't have jobs from the state, two teachers. My father had the job and my mother was fired. So she didn't work as a teacher. Some years and then she stopped. She had also private lectures. Unfortunately she died very early. She was fifty only in 41, just before the war. She was ill. I had a sister, an older sister. She was born in 1918, May 15 and she could enter the university. It was not easy because also as I've already mentioned, there was no law against Jews, however the policy was not to be accepted.</p><p>However, since my father was a teacher and had a lot of friends and connections, he entered the university. She studied chemistry but never worked as a chemist, a chemical engineer. She got involved, very early, as a student into the communist movement. In "43, there was already doings of war. And very many young communists were put in jail. She was also condemned to three years, in 43. In the jail, she got ill, she got tuberculosis. Maybe that was her luck because on this basis we could get her out from the jail temporarily and when the Germans came into the country, the German invasion in deg44, the first thing was that all communists were taken. She was not registered because she was registered as somebody who is in the jail so nobody was looking for her. That was the way how she escaped. Never cured perfectly so she was working, and then again in a sanatorium and so and so. Finally in "75, she died.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In "75? Where was she during the war?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: She was hiding with false documents. As I mentioned, nobody was looking for her, because was not registered as a freed person, and so she could get false documents and she could hide.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Where did people hide? I know a lot of people hid.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was not very difficult because many refugees came from Transylvania. She had also a document as a refugee from Transylvania and she just -- I don't know was recommended or in the newspaper -- she rented a room, a private room in a family house. The only danger was that somebody recognized her or was suspicious whether she is a hidden Jew. If they called the police, and looked after the documents, they are real. It was very difficult to check whether it was a real document or not because very often it was a real document. Only from Transylvania.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you have to pay a lot of money to get one of those?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no. The comrades gave her. She was a communist, yes. They helped each other --.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were your parents leftist leaning?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no, they were not. My father was a very progressive and a very open mind but he had opinions, you should know everything; you should read about everything but you should not commit. Don't go close to anything. He was -- you know what he was -- free -- very old international movement. Free -- Mozart was also a --.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: A mason?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: He was a freemason?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, well that's interesting.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, he was a freemason.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did he go t meetings?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, it was forbidden. It was not allowed, of course not. When it was allowed, that was before the First World War, then he went, yes. Maybe somewhere I still have the documents what he got there. Then after the First World War, it was strictly forbidden. Then he didn't go there. At least I didn't know about it....I just remember that in our library in the third row there, I found all this documents and the books about the freemasons.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I never completely understood, that's very interesting, the freemasons.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I didn't understand it either. Anyhow, I know the ideas were very good, very nice, to help each other -- yes, freethinker. That was the attitude of my father. He was very desperate when it turned out that my sister was involved in the communist movement.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: He was afraid?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, of course. One day in the morning at four o'clock, was ringing and they came and took my sister, you can imagine.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: That was in 2 <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Informers?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Informers, yes. The girls never did it. Only the boys. So they were frightened very easily so they gave the names. I knew about it so she told me previously, today they send this one was taken by the police so I am prepared tomorrow I will be taken as well. It happened.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was your family life, where did you live in the 1930's?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's also a typical story. My grandfather was a physician. My mother's father. I told you that my grandparents from father's side died very early. Also this other grandfather died also very early. He saved some money and bought a house in Budapest. He had the intention that he will live together with us and my parents will take care for him until he lives a full life. So we can live together. What happened before we could move into the house, he died. He was old already but he got leukemia and that's very quick. Then the sisters and brothers from my mother wanted their part. My parents didn't want to sell the house and to give them money.</p><p>They agreed they will pay the rest for these brothers and sisters. Especially one sister was very tude, she made a trial against our parents. She won, of course, because she had the right to get the ---. It was not a nice thing. Anyhow, for me it was good because ---.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What year was that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: What year? It was in "29. I was four years old.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How can you remember it well?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I remember the grandfather and the grandparents but the whole story I learned only later.</p><p>Actually, for me it was wonderful because this house was in Budapest, in one of the most beautiful parts, a hill on the dsboodocks. I was grown there in a garden. It's a family house. It was really wonderful. Of course, I didn't know about these problems with my parents. The house was too large because it was actually for my grandparents from father's side and for grandfather from mother's side and everybody died and we stayed there alone. Then my mother wanted to make some advantage of it and so she decided to make a boarding school from it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: A school?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No -- a boarding house -- a dormitory. For girls who come and live there -- since both parents were teachers, they could help them. They could get food there and the girls can live there.</p><p>That was in her mind. My mother had an excellent sense for business, so had my father, as me, too, yes, as I too. As a consequence there was this boarding house there, all facilities and everything, just no girls came, nobody came. One day somebody came, because it was really a very nice part of Budapest and the gardens, as I told you, and in summer it's ideal, so one day somebody came and asked if they cannot get a room there to live. Who had vacation . Since there were empty rooms, my mother told yes, why not? After a while people came to spend their holidays, vacations there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So it was like a bed and breakfast?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When was that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was still in the early "30's.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: 1935?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: deg32, deg33, yes already started in "31. 1 remember all the time, it was, I was very desperate because it meant that my mother was involved in this business and she didn't have time enough for me. I was jealous for these guests and I always was complaining that well -- to hell with these guests and you should care for me. Finally it was a very nice time. My sister was eight years older than I was and we were very, very close to each other. She had a fiance who was a mechanical engineer. He was very good with me and watched interest for signs in me. I had all this kind of attention; from father's side, the languages; from mother's side, mathematics; from sister, the chemistry; from her fiance, the engineering; but mainly mathematics was my first interest. Just I wanted to show that in this period, it was very nice. You ask whether we were religious or not. I had no idea what it was, Jew or not Jewish. The first time I had experience in this respect was when I was enrolled into primary school and religion was compulsory.</p><p>There was a list and they ask these persons should go to this room. I went there and found myself in a big room. There were all the pupils there, not only from the first grade but all four.</p><p>They started to pray, prayer and I didn't understand a single word. It was Hebrew and I didn't know what is is Hebrew. I didn't know what is Jew; I just saw that something different. I was told I am a bright boy, that I'm smart. I was so much confused by the whole fact and I went home and asked what happened. Then they explained me what it was. This is about --.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Then you studied Hebrew?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Then I studied Hebrew, I didn't mind it. My teacher asked me, not me but the class, well is anybody who doesn't pray every day? Since I was taught at home that you have to be always sincere and tell always the truth and you must not lie; of course, I was the only boy who said that I don't pray, never. She started to make reproaches, why not? I don't mind, I don't think of it. Then, you don't think that G__ will not think of you? I would have never thought about it!</p><p>Finally as a consequence, | realize -- this is what I learned there -- that in certain cases it's better if you lie. That was my first lesson, not to be sincere. Never left the religion, I've never denied that I was a Jew. Of course, now I don't. It's a different thing, that's a tradition. Moskir (Yiskor) what I wanted. Have you ever heard what is Moskir? Moskir is a part of a holiday prayer which is only three times a year, I think, but most important in Yom Kippur. You know what Yom Kippur is. Moskir, even people who are absolutely not religions, they go to Moskir because this is again a tradition, to think of the parents. To pray for them, the parents, or just to think of them. My father who had no idea about praying at all, he went to Moskir and my mother too just because his parents went to Moskir. You know, you understand the situation.</p><p>This is really, I think you will agree, it is the most important event in all the religion. This is really what we were taught. That was my childhood and then I went to high school. I knew, I was aware of the fact that if I want to enter the university, then I have to be the best in school.</p><p>So I was always the best without any effort because it was a public school and all the <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, that was also such a competition. I finished second in the high school among the students who just finished the high school from all over the country, from all the schools in the country.</p><p>There I participated in this competition in physics and I got fours, a prize. So I was among the best and it was something. I hoped to enter the university, or if there is any chance to enter the university, then I can get it because I was the best in the school. But it was "43 already and we had already two laws and it was very restricted and so I didn't get into the university. I wanted to become an engineer which was even more difference, it was always the most difficult for a Jew to be enrolled to a technical university. So out of question, well what to do? Then I will work, that's also a good experience, a good opportunity. If 1 want to become a mechanical engineer, I go into a factory and there I will learn. I will become an apprentice. I went to this t in Ujpest, and ---, <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I know that I read that there were actually higher-ups in the army who wanted to protect --.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yes, definitely there were excellent people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: There were points when you could have been taken and this was kind of a way of protecting part of the Jewish population.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, yes that's very true. {Female voice: "The young, the Jewish population who survived, they survived in the army."} In the army, in this labor camp. Not all of them, because it was depending on the leaders of this. In general, they were not as bad. That was also -- we had to work. I was young and even if I didn't have the experience in physical work, well it was not so bad.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You weren't brutally treated?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no, not at all.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It was sort of like being in the army only you were in this labor service?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: {" The places were very different."} Very different. It depended really from the leadership.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was the name of the place where you went?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Where I was? In summer, we were in, it's a very small place, Chicho__, it's in northern Transylvania. We were constructing a railroad. As for the second lane. It was very important for the war because it was only one rail and because of the transportation, they needed, urgently, a second one. We were building it. It was summer, we were young.</p><p>Sometimes we told each other that if we knew that we survive, then it wouldn't be so bad, like a summer vacation. We had good food. There was a very good organization, food. From this respect it was not bad. It was in summer. What I thought interesting, probably you know from history, that August 23, Romania went to the Soviet side. That meant that the war and the front came very close. When we finished this second railroad, next week, later it turned out, next week another b came or a group of locals and they blew up. What we were -- that's an <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Only Jewish men worked on this?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, not only Jewish men but in our group, we were only Jews, of course. There were other Romanians and Serbs, you know, these minorities who were not reliable and they didn't take them into the army as soldiers. They were in such labor camps. There was a big difference being a Jew or being a Serb. Danger always. We were not there very roughly from the soldiers.</p><p>There were nice officers, nice people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You had relative freedom of the camp?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no. We had absolutely no freedom of movement. We didn't have the demand for it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You were just marched from one workplace to another?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What about the food?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was good, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You slept in barracks?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We lived in barracks, yes. Again, it was not very comfortable but we were exhausted in the evening and we could sleep so it was no problem. The only problem we had was lice.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How long were you digging trenches?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We left this railroad the first days of September. October 10, we were already liberated. One month.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, October 19, 1944.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Forty-four.</p></p></dialogue>

Our soldiers were not so every eager for us, they were eager for themselves. As it turned out, we were left behind. When we stepped down in the night, all the Hungarian and German troops left and in the morning, we were there. We didn't know so we went further by the pretended intention to look for our lost battalion.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you have a special uniform?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, just --.</p><p> Q So you were identifiable as --.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We were identifiable -- we didn't have to wear the stars, the David stars, that was a rude thing, but we had to wear a yellow ribbon here. That meant that we are Jews, they knew it, everybody who wanted to know it. We went in this intention to look for our battalion. We didn't find any Hungarian or German soldiers but in two hours, the first Romanian soldiers who were from this particular village -- also the population told us, don't be silly, don't go, wait here, our people are here close to us. We were there without any effort, we were lucky. It was October 10 and this terrible thing in Hungary happened in October 15 when the Arrow Cross people, these ultra- rightist people took over the power. That was that. Then we were also lucky, in certain places, people were put into prison and took time until they could figure out that they are Jews and not enemies. Sometimes the Russians, especially, didn't care for it and they took them somewhere.</p><p>It was not a security. I remember just telling the joke when we were speaking among each other, when we were in this forced labor camp. I always told them as soon as possible I want to go over to them. Most people want to go to Budapest. What do you want in Budapest? What do you expect there? It's nothing there and maybe we don't find anybody there because we knew already that from the countryside everybody was taken. That was also what we expected from Budapest. But if we go on the other side, there is hope to survive. Some of them told me, yes and what do you want to do there? Then I told them, well, the worst case I go to Amskin. I will be at the university as a servant. It is even better to be a servant at Amskin Universitity than in {"Amskin is a very very good university. It is a very high --"?.

I was not a Zionist; I didn't want to leave for Israel. It was enough for me the experience in the labor camp, to be together with three hundred Jews. Among them there were terrible people, I have to confess. I didn't know what happened with my father, with my sister, with all other relatives. What happened with them -- as I told you, my sister was hiding and survived in this way. When she was liberated, she went into the Party, the Communists were there and she was working for them. My father, well in October 15, when this Arrow Cross people took the power, five days later, October 20, they went from house to house. They lived in a marked house with David's star.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Your father did?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, my father remarried. I told you my mother died in "41 but later he married.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Who did he marry?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Actually, she was a woman who was taking care for my mother because my mother was very ill for one hour and a half, so she took her --.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: One year and a half?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: One year and a half, yes. We found her and she took care of her and you know in this situation, how it is. My father was in very bad condition after the death of my mother and she stayed there and finally they married. I was very desperate because I was 19, and for a 19 years boy, it was a disappointment that the father marries. {"You were not 19, but 16."} Oh, yes, of course. I was sixteen and it was even worse, being a sixteen years boy. What is this age, how do you call it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You were an adolescent.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Adolescence, yes. It was a shock, really a shock. I liked her as a person but I was disappointed the fact that my father married so.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was she Jewish?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, she was. She was very good to my father. Objectively, I didn't have anything against it.</p><p>Later, of course, and now I see that it was good for my father because it was somebody with him. They lived together and October 20, these Arrow Cross people went house to house and collected all males under 60. Since he was 59, he had to go. He was a very fragile person with a very, very thick glasses. Never in his life, was working physically. Never did any sport. He had to go digging the trenches. I don't know how long it lasted, maybe three weeks or four and then all these people I mentioned already were taken to Austria, marching, walking. Because the Soviet army was very close, their last efforts was to take these people. I met one single --.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were they taken by the Arrow Cross?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, yes. Everything was in Arrow Cross. The terrible things, probably you heard --.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: This digging the trenches, that was not the army forced labor, that was a different kind of --?</p></p></dialogue>

It was then the Arrow Cross, the Budapest Arrow Cross had to follow it even in the army."} Even in the army, yes. {" Because that was the capitol. They had their people everywhere."} Everywhere. Actually what they did was a coup d'etat, right?</p><p>Because Hortee was declared the peace. There were some soldiers around him. That meant these soldiers are no more reliable. Only the Arrow Cross people were reliable, so they took the power everywhere. They decided what to do. Then I met, when I returned to Budapest, I met a physician who knew my father and who told me that he met my father on the road to Vienna and he lost his glasses. He couldn't walk and he was put on to a carriage and he gave him a shot, just to keep him somehow.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The physician did?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The physician gave him, yes. It was a Jewish physician who was on the road and he tried to help people who were there.
