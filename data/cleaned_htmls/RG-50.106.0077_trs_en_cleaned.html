It was, it was different. My grandmother my paternal</p><p> grandmother lived a simpler life. In a different section of Pabianice, but it was still it was nice. It</p><p> was nice. I should say though that my grandmother Salzberg I do remember when I was very,</p><p> very young we used to have facilities on the outside. I did not have that at my other</p><p> grandparents" house. But that changed relatively early on. But I do remember that. But then</p><p> again we always went in the summer so that was not a terrible hardship.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p> on those trips to Poland.

He was stateless, rendered stateless by the</p><p> German government. Well, getting a little ahead of it he was stateless because he was Jewish</p><p> but that came slightly later. But he was never made, he never was a German citizen.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I want to ask you some more about Hamburg and your childhood. You mentioned that your</p></p></dialogue>

Friday night. I want to say Saturday we knew it was the Shabbat. But we</p><p> were not observant in the sense that the orthodox people are. We were not. But yet we were,</p><p> both my sister and I as we were raised that's how we raised our children.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. Very large. Extremely large. I didn't' even realize how large as a child. Only it was in</p><p> later years that after the end of the war and since I've been back that I realized just how large the</p><p> community was. Synagogues and a lot of Jewish activity but we'll get into that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What were relationships like between the Jews and the gentiles in Hamburg?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you experience anti-Semitism as a young child in Hamburg?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But before the Nazis came?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not that I was aware of.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When you went to school, you started at kindergarten, elementary. Did you go to public</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> school or private school.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I went to, I started out in public school. Yeah public school to begin with unh hunh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And then what happened.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well since you know how old I am, I started school in 1932. 31, 32, when I was about five,</p><p> five and a half years old. And it was fine. We learned, we had fun. And it didn't last very long</p><p> because as you know in 1933 the Nazis came into power. And how I happened to be very,</p><p> become very much aware of that is because of something that happened to me in public school.</p><p> If you'd like I can tell it to you. I went to school one day as I always did and was called out of</p><p> class. And there was, I was called into an office of a very quote unquote nice lady and she had a</p><p> conversation with me and asked me many questions about my mother and father and</p><p> grandparents, my aunts, my uncles. It didn't' matter where they were. And what who my parents The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

And at that time I still had a great grandfather, my maternal grandmother's father</p><p> was still living whom I was very fond of. So they dug into the back, my background as far back</p><p> as a child of six, seven years old could remember. And when I came home and told my parents</p><p> about this, they were furious. And it wasn't too long after that that my parents put me into a</p><p> private school for Jewish girls. And my and that coincides with the time that I wasn't even</p><p> welcomed in public school anymore. What this was about, this interview was called in German,</p><p> I'll give you the German word for it. It's called Razen undazuhom. Literally translated means</p><p> race research. Race, race research is what it means.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You said your parents were furious. Did they explain to you why they were so angered?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think so. To the best of my knowledge my father especially was very vocal about it.</p><p> Because he felt at that time that it was a heck of a lot of nerve for these people to take, get hold</p><p> of a young person like myself and dig into their background. I have to tell you that at the time, at</p><p> the time, I wasn't aware. I was curious why. And I also knew that not everybody had this. And</p><p> you know kids are very tuned into other kids and other kids knew that I went for this interview,</p><p> but not everybody did. So already there was a line drawn. But it wasn't as obvious, as</p><p> horrendous to me as it certainly was to my father. Specially my father.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember the campaign that Hitler waged to get himself into political a position of</p></p></dialogue>

I'm sorry I'm way ahead of him. Wow, thank god there was no television then. Who</p><p> knows what damage he could have done. My father was a, like listening to the radio and I did</p><p> too. But when this person came on, I never understood what he was talking about because this</p><p> man screamed and yelled. And although I was very proficient in German and spoke what is now</p><p> called Hochdeutsch. They don't' even have that anymore. They speak one level of German.</p><p> And I also wrote in this different script which is Hochdeutsch.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can you translate Hochdeutsch?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: High German. High German. And yet I did not understand this person. If you listen to his</p><p> speeches today on tape or in the movie, movies that we have and when I say we, I'm talking</p><p> about the museum. Anyway historians have. Who understands what he's screaming about? I</p><p> certainly did not. I will say this, that I could see my father and mother and friends. As I said</p><p> before they had friends. Lots of friends. Being upset about it. And talking you know how is this</p><p> all going to, what is he saying. Or why is he saying these things about an Aryan race and all the</p><p> other things. Although he promised to make things better economically and that was what my</p><p> father explained to us, to me. His real mission Hitler's mission was to make things financially,</p><p> economically better at the expense of who knows. Who knew at that time.</p></p></dialogue>

I believe we were told that in school because I was still in</p><p> public school. I believe that they talked about it because immediately the pictures went up on the</p><p> walls of the school with him in his now infamous salute. Yeah. I don't know that I exactly heard</p><p> or understood or grasped the concept. Can I tell you that I saw this man?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I was going to ask you that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: When I was still in public school we went on a field, what's called a field trip. He was in</p><p> Hamburg and we had to go downtown and see Hitler. And although it was from a distance,</p><p> remember I was a small person then. So I craned my neck and yes I got to see him and we had to</p><p> give the what is now the infamous Heil Hitler salute. I will tell you, I was not comfortable with</p><p> that. And I didn't really quite know yet why I wasn't. But I wasn't. Probably what I heard at</p><p> home. You know that from the speeches that he had made and listening to the grown-ups talk.</p><p> But I did see him and heard him. I didn't, I no more understood him then I did when I heard him</p><p> on the radio. But yes I did see this infamous man.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What kind of impression did he make on you in person?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Being not, not that close to him. Well I already had preconceived impression. Having heard</p><p> him on the radio and having heard my parents and their acquaintances talk so I think maybe</p><p> that's why I was uncomfortable but I had to do it, give the salute. I might add I had to give that</p><p> salute every morning once he came into power. As we pledge allegiance in school, in this</p><p> country, to our flag, we had to give, I mean with every other word it was Heil Hitler.

<dialogue class=""><p> want to ask you to walk me through some of the changes that you might have noticed among</p><p> neighbors and friends in the early days of Hitler's chancellorship. What stands out in your mind</p><p> about that time?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [had two very good friends, a boy that lived in our building, same building that I went to visit</p><p> when I went back two years ago. And of a girlfriend. Her name is Ingeborg. I have, I remember</p><p> her. The boy and I was a bit of a tomboy, this particular boy and his friends, but I'm focusing on</p><p> him because he was, lived in the building. He joined very early on as a very young kid the Hitler</p><p> Youth and from that moment on I became an outcast. For several years he tormented us with</p><p> bad language, throwing stones, kicking us and as he got older, of course it got worse. He</p><p> somehow disappeared. I don't know if they moved or what happened. I, I really don't know.</p><p> The, this girl friend of mine from very early on, they didn't live that close to us but her parents</p><p> and my parents were also friends. And I do remember their last name. It was Vall. They my</p><p> parents stopped being friends with them. Or they with us and I never saw her again either. So it</p><p> was almost abrupt because they didn't live near me. Whereas some of these other kids did.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell me about some of these early experiences.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: As I said you didn't have to know the people, the youngsters. Mainly young people. My age,</p><p> older. You walked around with a nervous stomach and you saw kids that were not, that you</p><p> knew were not Jewish kids. Because we were teased. We were made fun of. We were called</p><p> bad names. They had nobody to answer to. In other words, this was the accepted thing. You felt</p><p> fortunate if they left you alone.

<dialogue class=""><p> anti-Semitism in Poland on those summer visits.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No because it was, things were very isolated visits as far as visiting family is concerned,</p><p> going to the country. I have to say that I did not. They may have been. I heard conversations you</p><p> know that they set, you know my grandparents used to say you know this person was you know</p><p> not friendly toward Jews. But especially my grandfather. He was in a situation where he was a</p><p> professional man. People came to him to get rid of a tooth, get rid of pain, to get a filling, to get</p><p> a tooth pulled. They were more than grateful if you took care of them. And he was also</p><p> somewhat educated in medicine. So they came to him actually for more than just the dental</p><p> work. And I would say that 60% of his patients were not Jewish. But very grateful that he took</p><p> care of them, because I used to sit there and watch him work.</p></p></dialogue>

Mainly I heard it</p><p> through my father who was a very much into the politics of the day and the conversations, et</p><p> cetera. But other than experiencing the anti, what we now call, what was then called to the anti-</p><p> Semitism or the anti-Jewish situation.

But it took a while.</p><p> I mean he, it was not subtle but he lost customers. Cause they wouldn't' buy from him. They</p><p> would initially say you don't need anything this trip around cause he also traveled. It didn't start</p><p> to affect his livelihood until it ceased. It did totally cease. For the last year I would say not more</p><p> that he was in business. And he also represented a company. He was a manufacturers rep. Who</p><p> had to break up their relationship with him.

I watched</p><p> this out of our home in, from the balcony. This was a small, relatively small. This wasn't one of</p><p> these big, big bonfires. They collected books. I don't even know where they got them from,</p><p> probably out of people's homes or stores or neighborhood synagogues. I have no idea where they</p><p> got them from. And they built like a fire. These were the uniformed brown shirt Nazis, a lot of</p><p> them young. The youth groups, the youth groups. Hitler Youth. Which you have heard a lot</p><p> about. And they would light them up and set them on fire and go nuts. And, and absolutely think</p><p> they were listening to a rock concert.

So I'm not going to say too much about it because I just, I right this second. I</p><p> know there was a lot of publicity about it and I want to say and I may be wrong but I think there</p><p> was a certain amount of sadness within Germany that he died.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well they had lots of posters, store fronts were marked. Juden, which of course means Jew.</p><p> Saw that pretty early on. I might also add that I would say that even prior to Hitler, maybe just</p><p> prior, just after he came in. There were the makings, not even the makings, it was a natural but</p><p> for a certain element of people to persecute or be anti-Semitic, as it is everywhere. Desecration</p><p> of a synagogue, desecration of a store front, name calling. You know I, I want to say that also</p><p> was part of normal life. It didn't necessarily all begin with this maniac. But of course it</p><p> intensified. We have listen we have some of that in any country. And I might add in Poland too.</p><p> But you know you don't dwell on it. It happens.

<dialogue class=""><p> child.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Primarily posters of Hitler's with the salute. We've all seen those posters, pictures, pictures of</p><p> SS men because they were the elite. Posters like that. Posters extoling Mein Kampf now. Not</p><p> the book necessarily but that again is in connection with Hitler. I didn't know too much about</p><p> Mein Kampf then, his book but that's what I remember seeing because they were up and around</p><p> and especially when I still went to public school. I knew when he was sworn in those things were</p><p> up in, within the school. And also throughout the city. Not everywhere but I would venture to say</p><p> in the theaters and wherever you went.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: About the racial laws and the intermarriage and all those classifications.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not just racial, not just inter marriage and et cetera, but also people that changed their religion</p><p> from Jewish to whatever. It didn't matter. It did not matter. A person was still classified as a Jew</p><p> not clean for lack of a different expression. Jews were responsible for all the bad things.

But we, I have to be honest. The media and the information that trickled back is not</p><p> like today. Today a person sneezes at one end of the world and it's picked up at the other end of</p><p> the world. Those were not days of great communication but my father did know about a camp by</p><p> the name of Dachau which has become infamous. And but you didn't really understand.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: During these events what was the Jewish community doing in Hamburg?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Go, mostly going on as best as they could, as normally as they could with many people</p><p> making arrangements, plans to leave. And others saying it will, I mean this will pass, this can't</p><p> be happening. I may be getting ahead of it but people were starting to talk about getting out.</p><p> And some left, some people left as early on as 1934, 35. My father's brother who would follow</p><p> him to Germany and they were in business together for a time his younger brother. He did not</p><p> leave under the circumstances that my father did because he was able to return to Poland and</p><p> visit. But he left in 1936 and that was supposed to be when we were offered well we'll get into</p><p> that I'm sure. But people started to leave. They didn't want to put up with, well they were afraid.</p><p> They were afraid. Some people more afraid than others and also I might say it's a tremendous</p><p> venture to pick up your family, your, your, your life and move it to wherever. It's a tremendous</p><p> and especially when there are children. We knew my aunt and uncle never had children so it's</p><p> not as traumatic. We had another my parents had friends Jewish Polish friends, they tried to</p><p> leave but they didn't. They had no children. People with children, it was a little harder, it was a</p><p> little harder to pick up. Imagine yourself having to totally leave. I mean for that time it, maybe</p><p> today it isn't. People are moving about the whole world. In those days they, they left for political</p><p> reasons like my father did but then he had established himself in, and was raising a family.

<dialogue class=""><p> in. The Evian Conference in 38. What was the reaction as best as you could tell and the Jews</p><p> around you when they realized what had happened at that conference. Or what was not going to</p><p> happen because of the conference.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, being again young not really understanding the full impact of it, other than what I</p><p> heard around me, they didn't go into these things in school. My I have to say my personal</p><p> reaction is only what the vibe that I picked up from my family, my father especially. And that is</p><p> the fear, fear. And it's not just from that conference but from everyday living is fear, fear that</p><p> the average person in this country just doesn't understand.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Explain what you mean by every day fear on an everyday basis. What was happening every</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> day that made you fearful.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Just going out. Having to sneak to school. Did you ever hear of anybody having to sneak to</p><p> school. In Germany there are six school days. One of them is Saturday. I went to a religious</p><p> school, a Jewish school . One did not go to school on the Sabbath but we had to get in six days</p><p> of school. So we went on Sunday. Well we had to sneak that so instead of carrying a book bag, I</p><p> mean this is just one relatively small example, although not so small. Carry instead of a book</p><p> bag, a dress bag. Put a book in, lunch, no outside recess, quietly. Again the word surreptitiously</p><p> went to school. Also you never knew what was going to happen to you on the outside.

Is somebody call, going to call me dirty names and then as things progressed they did</p><p> come into the schools, the SS people and very quietly and systematically escorted kids out of the</p><p> school. Now I don't know if you want to hear this now or, or as you get on with the interview,</p><p> but this is all part of it. So you live in fear because somebody out there is out to pick on you. For</p><p> the lack of a better word. I think it's more than just picking. Kids get picked on all the time. but</p><p> this is a different kind of picking on.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When did your parents first think about getting out Germany.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well we were my father was offered to leave Germany in 1936 because he had one brother</p><p> over here. But in 1936 he was still under the illusion that it would perhaps pass. The other thing</p><p> also was that sometime around that time the uncle that we have here suggested that my father</p><p> come by himself and leave my mother and his two daughters to come at a later time. And that</p><p> was not acceptable to him. I may have my dates a little muddled with that. But instead of he</p><p> basically felt when that first offer came, no I have a family. And my mother was totally against</p><p> moving. How could she leave. Poland was not that far away. If she came to let's say the US she</p><p> would never get to see her parents and her family again. And this will pass, this, this can't last.</p><p> People were in total I'm not going to say denial, but disbelief. Denial is too strong as far as the</p><p> way I understand denial means they just felt it, this can't last. It can't last. This will change.</p></p></dialogue>

Totally no livelihood, number one.</p><p>Number two the Gestapo started hounding us. Number three people were disappearing, people that we knew were disappearing. Kids were taken out from school, as I mentioned before, first very quietly, very nicely. And then not so nice. We lived in a very nice apartment building. You heard knocks at the door in the middle of the night. More people were taken away. A few screams, screeches. Everything you know it was horrific. We heard via my father and also via friends heard of people disappearing. Oh they were sent to on a train to no man's land which is out in the corridor. In fact that's the word I was looking for much earlier in the tape. And in the winter time. Because winter in Germany at that time came early on, sometimes on my birthday there was snow on the ground and I was born very late in September. But they were sent out on a train and then chased off the train into no man's land. And if they tried to come back or plead they were shot. These things came back to us. Or they froze to death or got away. And these things got back to me, to my parents and also to me. And by this time I'm already a pre-teen-er.</p><p>Pre-teen. And so beginning to understand. But primarily for my father it was the total no job, no money coming in. Being released from his representation. And then his own business, what he did on you know himself was also nonexistent. And it was constant harassing of the Gestapo and threats and primarily people disappearing and what they heard. And never to be heard from again. And also other people making plans to leave because Germany at the time that we're now at was in a state of frenzy to rid itself of Jews. So before my uncle Max, Max Salzberg and his wife Alice left, we already knew that we had to also make plans. That's when my father was offered the opportunity to come alone and we would be sent for later on and he said no it's all of us or none of us.</p><p> The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I never knew what my father had. In those days you don't think about it. I imagine that he</p><p> had money saved up.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My father applied to well he first had to be get an affidavit from this uncle in Paterson New</p><p> Jersey, Isaac Gothelf. He also needed to get this didn't, none of this happens overnight. He also</p><p> needed to get permission from the Germans to get out, permission to leave. Might I add that all</p><p> of us with the exception of my mother who had a Polish passport were stateless. And I was, my</p><p> sister, my father obviously was. SO you start putting into motion plans to leave which isn't like</p><p> going to a consulate today, get a visa and off you go. It's a lot of was a lot of work and</p><p> persistence. With the Germans definitely bribing them. Making so called friends with them,</p><p> well let's not call it friends, but it's bribing them and he did that. He bribed, he lied. He did he</p><p> put every trick out of his bag that he could so that we would not be taken away. That didn't</p><p> guarantee it. Did not guarantee it so he put into motion to leave. The affidavit from the uncle</p><p> finally came. The permission from the Germans finally came. But we didn't have a visa from</p><p> the US to come and that's where we almost didn't make it out because the Americans didn't</p><p> want to give us a visa. I hate to say that. Sitting here in this beautiful country, but they didn't.</p><p> And he had booked passage already for March of 39 which was changed because of a boat was</p><p> being painted. So he changed it December of 38. That also didn't work out. The Aquitania so</p><p> then he booked it for November of 38. With no proper papers. And my mother went, my mother,</p><p> my sister and I went to Poland in October of 38 which was a harrowing trip which is a story all</p><p> unto itself to say goodbye to the parents, the grandparents.

We're definitely leaving and that was within two weeks that we came back. And my mother said I can't leave. My curtains are wet. I'm not this, I'm not that. I'm not packed. I don't have the thing. He said I'm sorry we have to leave. And we did. But we didn't' have the visa so on the Saturday before we left we still didn't have it. We had pleaded, we had the way he was with the Germans because he couldn't, didn't bribe anybody at the American consulate. But he pleaded with them. He went every day practically. No visa, Mr. Salzberg, it's a quota it's a this, it's a that. Finally he went, took my mother, my sister Ruth and me down to the consulate. He insisted on seeing somebody. He was told nobody could see him. He says but you are going to see me, you are going to see us. Somebody has to see us. It was very dramatic, very compelling. There is no way that I can even describe that scene at the American consulate in Hamburg. There is no way. I can tell you about it and it's ever going to make the impact that it had on me anyway and I'm sure my sister and all of us, especially my father for the rest of our lives. This man finally let us in and we were told time and time again that you cannot have a visa today, the papers are not ready blah, blah, blah. We were like up on the fifth or sixth floor and my father said I'Il tell you something. With what's going on we are leaving and if we are not leaving Germany we are going out that window. He starts pulling me, my mother and my sister over to the window. We were going to jump. He meant it because he knew that our time was up. We had so far been left pretty much alone. As far as we weren't' dragged away in the middle of the night like many of our neighbors, let alone friends were.</p><p>People in school were. We were pretty much left alone. But our time was, was up. So this fellow who was there, Mr. Davis knew that well Mr. Salzberg meant business. And we did get the visa that day. And then the rest of it is all pretty dramatic too. We left. Am I getting ahead of myself here. We left a few days later. We got to Cologne. We left an apartment with furniture. Some The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

We, we left. We got to</p><p> Cologne but we left the housekeeper there. Her name was Frau Krug and we had a little parakeet</p><p> that I entrusted to her. And all the bens and the furniture but the parakeet to me was my most</p><p> important possession that I had to leave behind. We got to Poland the next morning. My father</p><p> called her up. I was right there with him when he called and you could see his face drain of color.</p><p> She told him, we left at, the train left at midnight. At 6 AM the following morning they came and</p><p> they were furious, the Gestapo. These were the people in the black uniforms, the SS people came</p><p> to take us away and when she told them that we had left they were furious. Absolutely furious.</p><p> The destroyed our bedding. They destroyed our apartment, they trashed it. Bayonetted my bird,</p><p> bayoneted this tiny little bird and beat her to a pulp. She was not a, see what she was doing</p><p> anyway was illegal. She was, she was not a Jewish woman. I have no idea what she was. But she</p><p> had nowhere to go so you know for her my father said listen. Whatever is here is yours. But</p><p> what are you going to do with it. So she was in the apartment and they didn't' believe her. They,</p><p> they beat her and destroyed everything. And that's how we know when they came. We have no</p><p> other way of know. How would we know but for her. And we were very grateful to be where we</p><p> were, but we were still in Germany. If this were five years later with telecommunications being</p><p> what they became, I don't' know that we would have made it out.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We had to get to Paris. Then we came to the border in Aachen and the Germans gave us one</p><p> last send off. Took my father off the train as they came through to check the papers. You don't</p><p> dare move in Europe. There are compartments and from each compartment. Remember we were</p><p> not the only ones running. There were many people on the train, some with no luggage but many</p><p> people like us. But they took my father off the train and you don't dare move. Every time we</p><p> moved we had everything or my mother or anybody that Nazi out there with the bayonet pointed</p><p> at you and he's ready. Any excuse, any excuse so let me see my father. He's talking and he's</p><p> very animated and we had no idea. All of a sudden they say the train is going to move and it</p><p> started to, move, start to move along slowly and we're hysterical. There we are. My mother and</p><p> two kids and no husband. He's still talking to the Germans. Finally we saw him run and he got</p><p> on the last what do they call it, the end of the train. The man was 40 years old, suffered from</p><p> high blood pressure. That he didn't have a heart attack then was amazing. What did they want</p><p> from him. When he finally came into the compartment and told us was they said he had too</p><p> much money on him. So he said well then take it. We don't do that. They didn't' offer him an</p><p> alternative. He says well why can't you take it. He says we are honest, we are honest people. We</p><p> don't take money. Well he had to come up with an alternative.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We left Hamburg on November sixth going to the seventh of 1938, just about the last legal</p><p> train. When I say legal, yeah legal. Not too many people came out after that.</p></p></dialogue>

Today's date is</p><p> September 15. This is a continuation of the September 8" interview with Jutta Levy. This is tape</p><p> 2, side A. You have been telling me about your escape from Germany. But I wanted to go back</p><p> and ask about something you had said previously about the last trip to Poland. YOU said it was a</p><p> harrowing trip. Can you tell me about that trip?</p><p> Jutta Levy: Well as I may have mentioned we went back at the insistence of my late mother. She</p><p> wanted to have her last goodbyes to her parents and sister and all the relatives. So she took my</p><p> sister and of course me, back to Poland. Now to go to Poland from Hamburg Germany, you get</p><p> on the train and you have to go through no man's land. That's that stretch of land at that time,</p><p> that was quote unquote free. That meant passing borders. You're going through border. Every</p><p> border stop is a stop and the officials come on board. Well at that time, this is late 38, the</p><p> Germans of course, the Nazis come on board and searched, questioned, very body on the train. I</p><p> didn't know at the time what strip search meant. I was a little past 12 years old and I found that</p><p> out in a big hurry. Because of a matronly German woman took the women aside and strip</p><p> searched them. I was one of them. And if anybody has ever been strip searched and especially</p><p> by an angry, German official of the Nazis, strip searching a young Jewish girl, you can imagine</p><p> what that was like. Not pleasant, not nice and without getting graphic very nasty and impersonal.</p><p> It is one of the most unpleasant experience that I had personally and I think that's all "m going</p><p> to say about that. I think one can imagine what that was like. They made it difficult. They let us</p><p> go but they made it unpleasant, difficult, and also very, very frightening.

But mercifully I did not. They were very thorough about checking our</p><p> luggage, checking us personally but this intense strip search was not repeated. But it was going</p><p> out of Germany to Poland. Why they didn't do it on the way back quite in that manner I don't'</p><p> know. It's was maybe a fluke or maybe the other was. I don't know. they were angry people</p><p> that, I think if they had had the chance they would have thrown us off the train. Just to be never</p><p> heard from again which they eventually, which they had already done and did more of. Again,</p><p> we were lucky.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I'm going to ask you. You just said a moment ago that they had already done, they had</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> already thrown people off the train. Can you clarify that point?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: in Hamburg where we lived as I said previously people began disappearing. Especially</p><p> people, Aust Juden which are the Jews from eastern Europe began disappearing. My parents for</p><p> instance had a couple. I can even remember their name, Mr. and Mrs. Max Steiner who</p><p> disappeared. We learned later on I learned later on. My parents knew even before that they were</p><p> rounded up. They were taken away put on a train, sent to what I keep referring to as no man's</p><p> land in the dead of winter. Told to get off at a given point. Oh they weren't the only ones. There</p><p> were hundreds of them. Told to get off the train. And just let go. Chased off the train, let go, in</p><p> the dead of winter. If the people didn't move fast enough for them, they were shot. If they</p><p> managed to get away, who knows where they went. Some managed to escape to other parts of</p><p> the world. Others froze to death. Others were shot to death. These stories have been The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

I mean they could have</p><p> done what they wanted to. But they didn't. At the time we did not know what had already been,</p><p> the atrocities that had already been committed. We didn't' know.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When you got to your relatives in Poland, what was that visit like?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Heart wrenching. Very heart wrenching. Not because of any dark premonitions, certainly not</p><p> on my grandparents, my relatives side. In fact my grandfather was a very intelligent very this is</p><p> not my maternal grandfather who is a professional man. Very far sighted very ahead of the times.</p><p> But he could not foresee nor did he the tragedy that was to come to Poland. What was happening</p><p> in Germany he felt as so many people did at that time, not so much anymore with German Jews.</p><p> But living in Poland was like living in another world here or another, certainly a faraway country</p><p> here. He just felt that it might pass. But he also fully understood why we had to leave given the</p><p> circumstances I've described before. Lack of making a living, the name calling the anti-</p><p> Semitism is a mild word for what was happening. The burning destruction of synagogues. He</p><p> was well aware of that. So with a lot of understanding he wished us of course the best but was</p><p> sad to let us go. Not just him, all the family. It was a heart wrenching experience, much more so</p><p> for my mother and it was for my sister and me too. I felt it maybe a little more keenly being older</p><p> and I loved my family there dearly especially my grandparents, my maternal and my paternal</p><p> grandmother in her, on my father's side.

We didn't' stay long. And again very, very heart</p><p> wrenching. Sad, sad.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you notice any changes in the social attitudes toward Jews in Poland at that visit</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. At that visit I wasn't even exposed all that much. We mainly visited. I also vested with</p><p> my girlfriend and I had friends over there but especially one who also did survive. Her family did</p><p> not. No I can't honestly say. My grandmother still, my maternal grandmother still had help in</p><p> the house. MY grandfather's practice was continuing on. No I can't say at that, don't' forget.</p><p> They were always somewhat anti-Semitic, some a great deal Anti-Semitic. I never felt it to that</p><p> extent. After all I was a visitor.

So yes they asked and as best I could,</p><p> as, as kids we're all we were all the same age. I had explained to them and they were interested</p><p> in what was going on thinking surely this would never come into their lives. Little did they</p><p> know but a few months later they marched in, the Nazis. Into Poland. And their lives changed.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p> more reflect about the moment when you were out of Nazi Occupied territory.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Unbelievable as I have told you. First of all the relief of my father getting back on the train.</p><p> Knowing that momentarily we were crossing into a place that was not Nazi Germany. It's hard</p><p> to explain when you realize that you can say something without being fearful, being afraid. I told</p><p> you that life had become full of fear, nervous stomach, that kind of fear.

Every time a uniform came in during the war. A friend of mine was in</p><p> uniform, whether it be army or navy uniform, especially officers, he froze. Momentarily and I</p><p> have to tell you I do too. And I wasn't, I had friends that were in the service, but the moment</p><p> when you see a uniform that is the fear that developed over a period of time and you live under a</p><p> regime for that many years. six years is a long time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Often times children will have nightmares if they're anxious about something. Is that</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> something that was true in your experience.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think so. And this was before we left. When you hear footsteps at night on marble floors,</p><p> boots, and they're not, you don't know but they're not stopping at your door but they are</p><p> stopping someplace else and you hear conversations and it gets loud you can't help but take this</p><p> with you when you go to sleep or if you're awakened by it. It's hard then to go back to sleep.</p><p> Sure. It's a, it was a fearful frightful I don't know how else to say it time in my life. I can seek</p><p> for myself. Not knowing all the ramifications but knowing enough to be afraid.</p></p></dialogue>

It's near the border where my father was taken off the train. And</p><p> once you are through that you're in Belgium. And there's another stop and more uniforms come</p><p> in. The uniforms at this point though are Belgian officials who spoke French and not German.</p><p> So once we got past that and they were, they were official, they were to the point but even</p><p> though we were fearful but there was nothing really to be afraid of at that point but as I said</p><p> before, you don't get over that. Once we got through that border, don't' forget there were many</p><p> other people on the train in the compartments other than us that were on the run. Some with only</p><p> the clothes on their back, no luggage even. But then they started to talk a little bit. Without</p><p> fearing that they would be arrested or they would be overheard for saying something that wasn't</p><p> politically correct. And what stuck in my mind to this day is that people smuggled things out. In</p><p> the most ingenious way. I remember one lady had I don't' know if it was a coat or a jacket but</p><p> her big buttons about the size of maybe even bigger than a half a dollar and she was so proud of</p><p> herself, as well she should have been, that she was able to smuggle out diamonds that were</p><p> hidden in the hollow of those buttons and I remember that and I was totally amazed. But in</p><p> retrospect how she got away with that. How they didn't, I mean this was just one. People had</p><p> other ways of bringing things across. But that, that was one thing that stuck in my mind. That</p><p> they were so relieved that they almost started to share and I did this and I did that and they were</p><p> saying, well they were basically trashing the Nazis which they hadn't been able to do all these</p><p> years. Being afraid to be overheard or if somebody, if they felt they were with somebody that</p><p> they could trust and they couldn't trust them. That was another thing. So you know it goes on</p><p> and on. It goes on and when you live under a regime like that and people like ourselves, people</p><p> like myself it takes a while to trust again and to say wow I can say this.

When I say uneventful, nothing is</p><p> uneventful and you're sitting with people that were running away from a dictatorship such as we</p><p> were running away from so nothing is uneventful. But we don't want to be repetitious. I don't</p><p> want tobe. We got to Paris where my mother had her brother there and we stayed there</p><p> waiting for the Queen Mary to take us to America. While we were in Paris, an incident</p><p> happened that really changed the rest of Germany forever. And that was the young Jewish</p><p> fellow. He was a Americanized, Greenspan that was his name and he killed an attache in Paris of</p><p> the German embassy. Most people are, historians are very much aware of that. This of course</p><p> caused a tremendous upheaval in Germany and that is a, it culminated what they call here now</p><p> Kristallnacht, the night of broken glass because of what this young Jewish fellow did out of</p><p> frustration, anger and whatever other emotion you can think of and I will say this, go on record</p><p> and have said it before. That was the culmination this Kristallnacht, the night of broken glass.</p><p> They had been doing these things, certainly in Hamburg and other places in Germany all that</p><p> year and certainly all that fall and early winter while I was still in Germany. I heard oh yes, store</p><p> fronts being broken into. And I knew of book burnings. I saw some of it. And I what I think we</p><p> mean by Kristallnacht which we were still in Europe then. But it was the culmination of and so I</p><p> only want to say that after that it was a miracle, as it was a miracle with us that we got out of</p><p> Germany at the time that we did.

When he and my uncle and other, we had</p><p> other relatives in Paris were talking about this incident it was with (pause) regret that this had</p><p> happened because it put in jeopardy so many people, which of course it did. It also was with</p><p> some relief that we were out because had the, had we not left exactly when we did. And I mean</p><p> almost to the minute, I wouldn't' be talking to you today. We got out just at the nick of time, six</p><p> hours before the Gestapo came to my house. That this young man chose that day that week to</p><p> shoot the German attache, causing tremendous uproar in Germany, and the fact that we were no</p><p> longer there was very fortunate for us.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Is there anything else that stands out in your mind on your stay there in Paris.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My father had a cousin in Paris who lived outside Paris. Their name was Gothelf. The first</p><p> cousin was a well-known artist there, Sam Zamush Gothelf, a well-known artist. He had a son,</p><p> 12 years old and here I meet this handsome young fellow. He was about 15, 16 at the time. And</p><p> at 12 years old the hormones already are working a little bit so of course I immediately fell in</p><p> love with this young cousin. He wrote a beautiful poem in my autograph book. Remember I</p><p> never go anywhere without my autograph book. He was also an artist. He even drew a beautiful</p><p> little picture. A forlorn seashore because we were leaving and turns out that this cousin we heard</p><p> later who I really liked so very much. His name was Guy, Guy, G-U-Y. Joined the resistance</p><p> and was shot as was his father. And needless to say although I found this out several years later,</p><p> it saddened me deeply. He was, they were talented lovely, lovely people. And especially the</p><p> young fellow who I, who I| liked so much. Actually I would say that was my first real crush. So</p><p> the other thing leaving there we had to go to Cherbourg. And everything happens at night. I</p><p> don't know why. Late at night we got to Cherbourg, got on a tender. Everything was black.</p><p> Everything was sort of blacked out. And all of a sudden this humongous monster appears in the</p><p> water. And that was the Queen Mary with a few little lights here and there. This huge to me</p><p> then and of course it is huge ship out there that we had to get on. And I have to tell you I was</p><p> scared to death, but we got on the ship and started our voyage across. In November, the middle</p><p> of November when the seas are pretty rough.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: As a matter of fact, I have pictures, tiny little pictures. There was a couple and I don't' know</p><p> if, where in Germany they were from, but they were from Germany that traveled and left as we</p><p> did. Basically the same circumstances that were traveling with very, very young children, babes</p><p> in arms and I do have a picture of them. Because I, I loved autographs and pictures if I could get</p><p> them. And I do believe they also wrote in my autograph book. They stand out because I, even</p><p> though I don't' know where they came from but traveling with very, very young children into an</p><p> unknown situation.</p></p></dialogue>

She boarded. She and her family</p><p> boarded the ship in Southampton. They left before I did but we never ran into each other. That</p><p> ship is a big one, was a big one, still is.

As I expected it would be. And</p><p> I don't know because I think life was gray and kind of sad at that point. The thing that was</p><p> pointed out to us was the Statue of Liberty and I had heard about it but vaguely. And I couldn't'</p><p> tell you if I knew the significance of it but I soon learned because people were talking about it.</p><p> and to see the Statue of Liberty and people talking about what it meant that we are now free and</p><p> to pursue, to, to worship, to all the things that it really stands for. To have people talk about it in</p><p> German because that's all I spoke at the time, that was quite a moment. Thinking back on it</p><p> now. Getting off the ship was quite something else again. My father got down on his hands and</p><p> knees and he kissed the concrete ground as he came off the boat. And that's a moment I won't</p><p> forget. The next thing that I saw was a stevedore that just that one stevedore. I remember. He</p><p> was black and I had not seen too many black people before. In fact I hadn't, I had seen one. And</p><p> he was in flowing robes and sort of a diplomat in Hamburg. So and then at first not seeing my</p><p> relatives, well I mean I had never met them, you know and then my father pointed out over there</p><p> his brother and his two brothers actually. The one that had left before us and the one that had</p><p> been here for many years. I have no other impressions. It was very overwhelming, very, very</p><p> overwhelming. And if you want me to continue on in that vein. The uncle was there that had</p><p> signed our affidavit. We went to his home. we spent one night there and I was separated from my</p><p> parents which was almost as traumatic as that whole experience of leaving Germany.

Because as I started to tell you, I was here one day, new country,</p><p> new language, new everything and my parents went off to Detroit Michigan where my father's</p><p> two brothers were and I was to go with this great aunt and uncle who lived in Washington, DC,</p><p> people that I didn't' know, really never heard of them, but this was my grandmother Salzberg,</p><p> my paternal grandmother's sister and her husband who said that they would take me because</p><p> there was not enough room for me in Detroit. So since I was the older of the two daughters, I</p><p> was the one that was elected to go with them. Now coming to a new country, being here one</p><p> day, at most two days and one night and then leaving my parents and my sister was t, do you use</p><p> the word traumatic. It was traumatic. I came here with them on the train. They were very nice</p><p> people. They didn't' understand me, I didn't understand them. They talked Yiddish but German</p><p> and Yiddish people say are so much alike, but if your ear isn't used to it you don't understand.</p><p> And they tried, maybe a little bit of German but it was I didn't understand and I had to go with</p><p> them. And nobody's going to feel sorry for me because they had a beautiful home. they were</p><p> very well heeled people. He had a chauffeur driven car in Washington. And so I don't want</p><p> anybody feeling sorry for me. I just felt sorry for me. It was my heart was aching. I was alone. I</p><p> felt like I had been left, like I had been abandoned. And so I was not a happy person when I first</p><p> came here. And I must say even though these people were wonderful, they meant well. The</p><p> Ulmans, U-L-M-A-N. They were very good to me. They were generous. But I was very</p><p> unhappy and very lonesome.</p></p></dialogue>

I had, my</p><p> physical needs were taken care of. I was treated very well. They sent me to the Americanization</p><p> school. They bought me a couple of more Americanized clothes. Not much, a little bit. They</p><p> had other family here from his side. He was, Mr. Ulman was not my blood relative but his wife</p><p> my aunt, great aunt I might say that part. So his he had family here and they weren't too nice to</p><p> me but I frankly didn't' realize that until I understood a little bit more but they sent me to the</p><p> Americanization school. Downtown at 13" and New York Avenue. The building is still</p><p> standing. So I was put in with, I was the only kid there. They were all adults. To say that I</p><p> disliked it is putting it mildly. I hated it. And I don't think I got a whole lot out of it because I</p><p> was frankly unhappy. I cried a lot. I cried myself to sleep. I don't' know. I woke up crying. I</p><p> was lonesome. They tried very hard. I, I need to say that they tried hard and I guess they thought</p><p> I was happy. They had a business here. He took me to the business with him. I had no chores to</p><p> do. I basically had nothing to do. I would go the Americanization school which was not a good</p><p> experience for me. They didn't put me into a school and I wonder, years later why not. But</p><p> that's how it went. If my father called I would cry and tell him how unhappy I was and a few</p><p> months later he did make a trip to Washington to see me. I did not see my mother that whole</p><p> time.

So he went back to Detroit. About nine months later, maybe a little more but let's say nine, nine and a half months later my father did pick up with my mother and my sister and moved to New York. My mother had some cousins there. And he felt maybe that would be better. He didn't' like Detroit, didn't like what was going on there between the brothers, et cetera. And he came to New York and once I knew that they were in I wanted to be there also. And he came and he got me. And from a beautiful home on Davenport Street in Northwest Washington I went with my, I went to a walk up apartment at 91 and Amsterdam Avenue. Right along with the bedbugs, rats and the mice.

If he made two dollars he would spend it to buy then made two more dollars, spent, and bought kept the profits so we could eat and have the rent. We had very little money. We did not come here with bundles of money. He my mother made hair ribbons and my sister and I helped and various other things like that. And in the meantime all the while looking for some type of work. Without getting too wordy on this. About not too many months, not too many months, he found a position representing a company that sold basically the same things that he sold in Germany. For the territory that encompassed Washington, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. So he started thinking about making the move to Washington so he could be closer to the territory that he was to represent. And that was for him a dream come true because he already liked New York. He didn't' love it, but he did love Washington. A good reason. It was a beautiful city. It was cleaner at that time. Than New York and very much like Hamburg. He always used to say it reminded him, it was that type of city. So I would say within a year's time we made a move here. And I The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

WE didn't dare talk</p><p> while he was listening to the news because he was anxious to know every little bit that there was</p><p> of what was going on in the world. Primarily in Europe and more specifically in Poland. And</p><p> not a whole to came out. Again, given the lack of knowledge as far as communication is</p><p> concerned as we know it today. Some things leaked out of course, not leaked out but became</p><p> known but again things move very swiftly once that Hitler marched into Poland. It was a</p><p> progression that went along very swiftly as history tells us today. And we all know it. Poland</p><p> was not the only stop he made. He made quite a few other stops and it was a constant search for</p><p> news and for us specifically. But of course my father became agitated every country that he</p><p> went into. That Hitler went into, he was agitated. And he was in a constant state of agitation and</p><p> frustration. And also making a living, making a living. My mother worked and at 14 I went to</p><p> work. I don't know what else to say about that period.</p></p></dialogue>

To begin with we were four people in a one bedroom apartment. And shortly before</p><p> Pearl Harbor we moved to a two bedrooms and at 2:00 I took my bath. And I heard my father</p><p> about that time yelling that the Japanese had attacked Pearl Harbor. And I did not know where</p><p> Pearl Harbor was. Obviously he did. And I quickly got out and I thought what's going on,</p><p> what's going on and he explained that Pearl Harbor was in Hawaii which was at that time a US</p><p> possession or protectorate. I don't know what you call it. And essentially we would be at war</p><p> with the Japanese. I have to tell you though that there was a little bit of a lilt to him, to my dad</p><p> because he felt that once the Japanese, once America and at that time Roosevelt had not been</p><p> declared but he and his friends and there was lots of talking going on. Once they declared war on</p><p> the Japanese, as certainly they did it wouldn't be too long before we would declare war on</p><p> Germany. And they were waiting for that, they were waiting for that. As much as people didn't</p><p> want to go war in America or Americans to go to war, people like my dad and at this point we</p><p> too felt better get in there. Have to put a stop to what's going on. So it was horrible, horrible,</p><p> horrible. And things happened so quickly within a period of two, three days.

Because we left. So we know more or less what had happened in Germany. As far as the countries that he occupied. For instance in for us more importantly Poland, we got a phone call. We knew that things were not good. Things had started to come out. My father was very, very concerned. My parents were about, and other people, but we're specifically talking about my family. We knew that many evil things had gone on there and I refer to them as evil things as opposed to say anything else. Just how bad and how our families were affected, we really didn't know. It was a nightmare that was going to come true.</p><p>Then we got a telephone call from Sweden, from mother's sister. Flora Kerner at that time. And, telling us that she and my, her daughter my cousin, Rita, had survived but that everyone else in our family had perished. I remember my father being on the telephone and falling to his knees because he was so very emotionally upset, drained. And very other thing that you can name. It wasn't a long conversation but it was enough so that he got an almost full picture of filling in gaps of things that we had only heard about or read about or listened to on the radio and now his worst nightmare come true as far as our personal family was concerned.</p></p></dialogue>

It's</p><p> displaced person's camp they were put in. And that's where my aunt called from. It took several</p><p> days after liberation because they were very generous from what I understand about having</p><p> survivors call but my aunt had not been well. She had contracted typhus, I believe it was. So it</p><p> took a few days, maybe not even extra days, but it took time. and there were thousands and</p><p> thousands of extra people in various camps that were trying to reach family all over the world.</p><p> But she did call us and she told us at that time, she would call us again when they got to Sweden</p><p> because that was where they were going.</p></p></dialogue>

However, always hopeful that perhaps they weren't as touched as so many thousands, millions were. At that point we weren't thinking in terms of millions. We didn't' know. At least I didn't know but we knew that bad things had happened over there. We could only hope that we would get some good news that families had survived, some of our family if not all had survived. Hearing that they hadn't other than my mother's sister and her daughter was in one way of course very good news. But in another it was horrific. It was my mother and my father were devastated as was I. At that point already I was on my way, I was and adult just about, an adult already and I remembered being very pained, very, very pained. To say the very least. It's an awful feeling to hear that all your family that you left behind but two people had perished. And at that time we really didn't know exactly who died in which way. We didn't know that exactly until they came here. And I'm getting ahead but my aunt and my cousin came here after Sweden, not too in 1946. So about a year, a little over a year after they were liberated. My father brought them home. He, if you like I can tell you when they called him from Sweden which was maybe a week after their initial call, he immediately went and I went with him, this is now 1945. Immediately went to I believe it was the Red Cross. I remember going on a Saturday downtown with him and getting, wiring off to the Red Cross and the wire services, $50, which to us was like it would be $5000 today. Got it together and sent it to my aunt and my cousin in Sweden. And with which he then went to work to bring them here.</p><p>Which he did. He had them sponsored by my aunt, the lady that I lived with here. They were moneyed people as I said. He got her to sign the affidavit. She didn't blink an eye and signed it, not with all the problems that we had. And we tried to get her over here and did of course.

What was camp, concentration camp like?</p><p> Well for two hours or more my cousin told me graphically as graphic as she could get exactly</p><p> what camp was like, what ghetto was like, what camp was like for her because I have since heard</p><p> other stories but that was my first. And I was absolutely horrified. Talk about nightmares, if I</p><p> didn't' have terrible nightmares before, I sure had them after that. Here was somebody in front</p><p> of me that had lived through these horrors and they were other people that had worse stories. But</p><p> her story and it's been documented was not pleasant, it was horrible. What my aunt and she went</p><p> through and my family.

I have a feeling that that kept</p><p> her from being exterminated because she could tend to patients that had from what she told us</p><p> horrible diseases in the mouth because of malnutrition, et cetera. And they tried the Germans, to</p><p> for the Red Cross anyway for people who came to put up an appearance that they were doing all</p><p> that they could, quote unquote.

And the ramifications of all what we've been talking about the last few minutes, didn't' really come to a, well there's no concluding cause nothing is over. But the full impact didn't come til many, many, many years later. I would say as recently as 15 years ago, 20 years ago. That people really began well when those survivors started speaking. They haven't been talking all that long. I for one started to talk about my own experience when my kids got really involved in their high schools, at Blair High school. The teacher wanted to ask my older daughter who is now 44, is anybody in class who has a mother or father that is survived the Hitler regime that was from Poland or Germany or Romania, or Russia or whatever. And the only one in the class that raised their hand was my daughter. Shannon. And the teacher said well she asked about me and my daughter was told her that oh yes my mom was born in Hamburg Germany and she lived under Hitler for six years.

I saw the apartment, I</p><p> saw ultimately the school where I went. Not the public school, the private school. I went into the</p><p> building, into the apartment.

The only thing that remains of it is the front of it because it was granite and it had been relatively newly built. They couldn't burn granite. The Hebrew lettering is there and I have pictures of that. What was my you asked me what was my impression going back. The area that I lived in was not bombed or harmed so basically it was somewhat frozen in time. The downtown area has was completely bombed and rebuilt. It's a very rich city moneywise. Pros, prosperous is a better word. I did get to see some special places that we used to go to. I also had the opportunity to go to the concentration camp Bergen Belsen where to me that's like a cemetery because people that I knew and loved I think perished there.</p><p>I'm not even sure but certainly my cousin and her mother had survived it. it's been sanitized. It's become like a memorial and I will say that the Germans do visit there because they have very few Jews in Hamburg. Very few. Bergen Belsen is about two hours outside of Hamburg which I didn't even know. Between Hamburg and Hanover. I didn't know that. Til I got there. I've forgotten that you asked me. The overall impression. I was sad. When I left the plane took off and I looked down at the city where I was born and I was sad and I cried, the only time I cried.</p><p>Oh I shouldn't' say that. I did cry in the back yard of the school because it hadn't changed. But when we left I cried. Why? I was born there. I grew up there. What I felt they took away my childhood. I had realized it before but it didn't' impact me as much as, my husband was sitting next to me on the plane. And it didn't impact me until I left. They took away my childhood. They did and for that and that's a small maybe price to pay in view of what others lost but don't forget I lost my family too. But I wasn't' in a camp. I didn't starve. We were very dirt poor when we first came to New York. All that was do-able and bear-able. But we're talking about me talking about me and how this whole part of history impacted me yeah it did. They took away my childhood. They took away what might have been for me, education wise. Many things. And The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.
