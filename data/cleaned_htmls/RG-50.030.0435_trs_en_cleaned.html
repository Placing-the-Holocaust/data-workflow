<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Why don't we, I'd like to begin by having you tell me your name, date of birth and where you were born, and a little bit about your family. And you might tell me your name now and your name at birth.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My legal name is Itka Zygmuntowicz. I was named after my maternal great-grandmother Itka who was also born in Poland. And my family name, my parents name, was Cim-mo-nella-simon (ph). My family use to call me Yit-cola (ph) In-de-yum-fa-yetska (ph), a name which I like to be called. I was born April 15, 1926 during Passover, the Jewish holiday celebrating . I was the oldest of three siblings. I was born in a small town, Chair-han-off (ph) Poland, located about 90 kilometers north of Warsaw. At the time when the Nazis came in, I was 13 years old and the population of our hometown, Chair-han-off (ph) Poland was about 15,000. A little less than half of that was Jewish. My family consisted at that time of my parents, Hymen, my little brother Soo-lick (ph), my little sister Zee-sil (ph) and my maternal widowed grandmother, . My ancestors on my mother's side came to <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> again." And my grandmother, who was a woman of very deep faith, tried to comfort us and she said, "Yit-cola (ph), , don't cry. With God all things are possible." I always admired my grandmother's strength because she lived through World War One. She lost a brother, she lost her husband, she lost two of her children, that was before the Holocaust, and she lost a granddaughter. But she never lost her unshakable faith in God. And she always believed and she never questioned. And it seemed to me the more she suffered, the more she believed and the kinder she was, so she was a wonderful role model for me. And she lived with us from the day I was born. And she was the only one in my family who was privileged to die a natural death shortly after Germany invaded Poland. From early childhood on my parents and grandmother stressed to us children the meaning and importance of , which in English means</p><p> humanness. Whenever I would do something that didn't measure up to the yardstick of , they never screamed at me, they didn't hit me, but they would explain to me why it's wrong, and usually they would say, "Yit-cola (ph), its not -" Luse to cringe when they said this here because I knew that they disapproved and eventually I started to view myself through that yardstick. You know, when I did something I felt always will my parents approve?</p><p>But they also, what they did also is that they, when I did something good they used to praise me.</p><p>And I really felt that they loved me unconditionally and that was a wonderful gift. But they were strict with me. When I was already a school girl, I remember in Poland was very cold winters and some of the kids, and we were wearing old wool socks, stockings I mean, and I don't even remember how they use to hold up but I remember they were always rolling up, they were like you know and the kids didn't like it. So a few kids put on knee socks and I wanted to wear knee socks too. So I remember that I asked my parents, can I put on the knee socks? And they said, "Yit-cola (ph), its too cold". And I was naughty and I figured I'm not going to start to convince them, I felt I'm not going to be cold, , so what did I do? I went in <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> so angry with me? Why do they hate me so much? I was too young to understand it and I came home crying bitterly. Usually I was not a cry baby and my mother saw that something serious must have happened, she was home. And she asked me, "Yit-cola (ph), what's happened?" You'll see later why those things are important, because of the values.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So your mother asked you what happened?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: What happened. I related to her the whole story. And she did not say a single word, she just took me lovingly in her arms and she tried to comfort me. After I finally quieted down and stopped crying, she looked at me and she asked me, "Yit-cola (ph), and what did you do?" And I was shocked. I said, "Nothing." And my mother looked , she said, "Well my <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> called , or guests. And then there would be conversation at the table and they used to <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> way. They cannot relate because, to give you an example, if someone, God forbid, has a terrible illness then when he talks with somebody who is healthy at that time, the healthy person could talk about the future and relates different to life, sees life differently, and this is here. So, in my, it never entered my mind that one day I will suffer like this here. That my people will suffer like this here.</p><p>And I remember also another incident, its like I started to tell you, we didn't have heat but, we didn't have running water and we didn't have electricity in our home, so we...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Let me just ask here, you didn't have these but that was normal? You were fairly middle income?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, that was not because we were of poverty. This was because in the small 5 nobody in the small had it at that time. So, in fact, when I went now back to Poland, they still have, some people have outhouses and things, you know? But its so much more moder, its more in the larger city. But at that time it was common, you didn't know <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> she was very protective of me. In fact, I was never away one single day in my, until the Nazis came in, alone. I was always with the family. So I walked down and I brought up the butter. And afterwards I wasn't so afraid anymore of the dark root cellar. For two reasons. First of all, because I remembered my mother's words, "Go, Yit-cola (ph), God is in the root cellar." And secondly, for myself I thought, if I could do it once I can do it again. And so at home it was warm, it was a wonderful world. My grandmother was, like I mentioned, she would not permit me to take a bite of food without saying , which means a special prayer. And always stressed the importance. Yiddish guide, the mental guide to her was . And another thing which I do really appreciate a lot about my grandmother is, that whenever I did for her a little added. She never took me for granted. She would many times over say, "Oh my , God Bless you and thank you", and she would make me feel so good. And one time I said, "Grandma, its just a little thing." I didn't call her grandma, I called her 5 for grandmother. <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What year are you talking?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: What year? I would say like in 1937 or 1938 it started to get a little more because I don't remember the exact year that Pew-suit-ski (ph) died, but things were a lot better. Though the government officially didn't have any law against Jews, or sanctions, but there were many types of things I remember from the stories that I heard, the family tell and from other people, and from history. That I know that the Jewish people were, we were on the .</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you know about, or did your family talk about, what was happening in Germany prior to 1939? Did you know who Hitler was?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: At the time? No. I didn't know much of politics, yes. I was like I said a creative child. I was more interested in writing and in playing with the kids and doing art work and singing, I loved to sing since I was a child. And my mother taught me, not just my mother but both my parents because they used to take me to the theater, many songs and things.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So your family didn't talk about what was happening in neighboring Germany?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Maybe they talked but I don't remember this in particular. That didn't, you know, like I said, I was only 13 years old when the war broke out. And another thing when I was a child, here a 13 year old child knows a lot about her body, knows, you know? Because I wasn't brought up in the environment and my grandmother was so orthodox, so it was more modest and you didn't know much about sex, you know? And we didn't talk too much about those things at that time. And I remember that in our city there was a girl, her name was Rosa Loberta (ph) and she was a leader from . And because some of my friends who were somewhat older along there, to tell you the truth, I knew it's a Zionistic organization. I didn't understand yet exactly the, I didn't know too much about politics to be very honest with you. So I wanted to belong too. And in Poland everybody belongs to orthodox, to some different organizations, but practically everybody belonged to the organizations, so I wanted to belong to . And I remember she took me to one meeting and Rosa Loberta (ph) was there and I met her and I said to her, "Rosa, I would like to belong to the meeting." And this was about a year before the Nazis came in. And she said, "Yit-cola (ph), you have to wait because it starts from <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> used to try to play all kinds of games to try to guess what is in that chest. And I used to think, maybe a treasure, maybe a skeleton, I even used to went so far as to think that maybe I am adopted and they don't want me to know that I am adopted and they are hiding the papers. It was a whole source of curiosity for me. And I remember one day my mother said, "Yit-cola (ph), please come.</p><p>Come here. I want to show you something." She took out the key and she opened the chest. And I had like two kinds of emotions. In one way, I was burning with curiosity to see what is in the chest that was constantly closed. And on the other hand, I was frightened, what I'm going to find there?</p><p>What is there? And she opened the chest and she said, "Look Yit-cola (ph)." And it was a whole chest full of books, all leather-bound books. And she took out a book, pointed to the closet, she said, "Yit-cola (ph), when you will learn how to read, you will be with the greatest minds. You can sit right here in Chair-hon-off (ph), you will see the world through great poets and writers and you will travel all over the world." And she took out a book, she took me on her knee, and she started to read. And this became a daily ritual to which I looked forward. And I was quite young when I knew a lot of Yiddish literature and Yiddish plays and poetry because my mother never read to me little children's stories, she started with this grown up stuff. And one story that I wanted to relate, which was written by , a Yiddish writer, it was called <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 0 other world where they were so cruel to him here? And yet, Buncho (ph) didn't complain. Not to man, not to God, never, he was envious that somebody had more. So finally they said, "Buncho (ph), what would you like?" And he couldn't believe it. And finally he said, "Well, your Excellency, all I would like is every morning for breakfast a hot roll with butter." And when I was, later during the Nazis, I was thinking very much about this story because I realized why he was silent. He had no choice. And also, what would we give for a piece of bread. So the literature, and also another thing which I often think about this story, is that Paris (ph) who was a great Yiddish writer, that he wrote about one man and this has become a Yiddish classic. This book is in English still and its beautiful. I didn't go into all the details because it would be too long, but the basic thing is, the cruelty. And when he says here that they look, why was he silent? He didn't have to be silent, he should have cried out. But when the Nazis came in, I realized that I became like Buncho (ph) the Silent. When Germany invaded Poland, the first thing of the hometown, the first thing I remember, because at that time we lived in the other house already. And our house was strict</p><p> , which was near Warsaw Street, which was the main street. And as soon as we <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 1 intelligencia (ph). Some Polish people too. And they took them away some, they shot, the ones they took away, I didn't see what they did with them so I can only bear witness for what I saw. And they started to destroy the Synagogues, the Holy Scriptures. They confiscated all our businesses.</p><p>We didn't have, in Check-hon-off (ph) a business. My father was, like I said, I told you before.</p><p>And they started to put on curfews. We were not allowed to congregate in large groups. I could no longer, we could no longer go to school, all schools were closed. All social Temples were closed.</p><p>We had to wear a yellow star. We were not allowed to walk on the pavement, just in the street.</p><p>And we had to give up, everyday when we're told this is the worst, something worst happened.</p><p>Everyday they made new laws. And we were not allowed any longer to observe the Jewish laws because they burned, not openly, they had to do it in hiding.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How soon did this happen after they came in?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well the burnings, they started to burn books. I told you, my mother valued so much book and its still such a love for me, for books, and here they started to burn the Holy, all the books that was from the Yi-shiv-as (ph) and all the books from the Synagogue, in the Synagogue, they burned down everything. So they started to just destruction right away, and curfews, and we were not allowed to congregate in large groups, you know, for religious people, to go for ; which is you have to have 10 people to have for the prayers. So all those things were, actually religious people suffered the most. They started to, when they saw elderly men, most of the people, my father didn't have a beard, he was clean-shaven, but so many other people did. So they laughed, they started to pull out the beard or they would shave off half a beard. They started to torture, to mock. Because to, they did whatever they wanted. They had all legal rights to do those things.</p><p>And then they confiscated the business, they looted the merchandise. They started to ration the food and started starvation. And also we had to, they would grab people to do the work in the street.</p><p>And after a whole day's work, they would come home and would have to stay in long lines to get a small ration, a very small ration. So right away we started to starve. Couldn't go to school. And in other country the most important right is the right to protest, to speak up. But you couldn't. So that's when I was thinking a lot about starvation, about Buncho (ph) the Silent. That we had to be silent, you know, in order to survive. And then something happened which effected me very much personally, and my mother. They asked us to give up all our valuables, gold and valuables, so we become impoverished and we had to do forced labor. So one day, and also there was a law, that the Jewish people, for the Germans to associate with Jewish people was</p><p> because they singled us out as an inferior race. And we were not allowed to have <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 2 bought maybe 90 percent of the merchandise. My mother didn't buy anything. We gave up the merchandise, you know? Maybe he hid a little bit because I remember, but before we came to the ghetto I remember seeing my mother taking out from her corset, you know women were wearing corsets, and it was like a bone, like a plastic bone, she pulled this out and she made rolls of money and she stuffed it in so they could hide it on them, so they must have saved some money but maybe she didn't want to spend it or whatever. But anyhow, the Nazis left, I mean the, Cal-fus (ph) left, the people left and this man, who was selling the merchandise. But it didn't take long, this same man brought the Gestapo into our house and denounced my mother. And they asked my mother, "Who is the man who brought the merchandise, because he told us." And that is the first time in my life that I heard my mother lie. She said she didn't know. But she did know who he was. He was not a personal friend so we were not very involved with him, but we knew who Cal-fus (ph) is, I knew him very well because, like I said, I went to school there. So after...</p><p> End of Tape 1.</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. <span class="page-break" number="11"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 3 Tape 2</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So, I was telling you of the story about, when this man who sold the household articles that we didn't know brought the Gestapo to our house and they interrogated my mother. They wanted her to tell who Cal-fus (ph) was. And, I'm not sure whether I mentioned this, that this was the first time I heard my mother lying. That she said she didn't know, she denied it. So after interrogated for quite a while, they saw that they cannot get out of her anything. They took her away. The Gestapo took her away. I was by that time 13 years old, and I saw already the cruelty, what's going on, they started many destructions, many people were already killed and tortured. So I was afraid to be separated from my mother. So I run after her. And I was determined, no matter what's going to happen, I'm not going to leave her alone. So they kept on chasing me away. And finally, one of them said, "Take her too." And I was almost happy that they took me too because I think that whatever happened, otherwise I won't even know if they take her away, I want to know what's happened to her. And they brought us to the Gestapo, the station, and they separated us. They took my mother in to a separate room. This, I was not an eye-witness, I was an ear-witness. And, what I heard, it sounded like they were beating her and she was screaming. The shouts got louder and louder and after a while it was silent. That's when my heart almost stopped too, because as long as she was screaming, I knew that she's still alive. But when it was silent, I had no longer any knowledge, whether she's still alive, whether she's conscious. And what seemed to me like an eternity, I cannot estimate how long it took, but finally the doors swung open. Two Gestapos, each holding her under the armpit, dragging her across the floor. And took me in, to be next. And I wanted to see whether my mother, I saw she was bleeding, and I wanted to see whether she is still alive. So I looked at her, while they took me out, took her out, they took me into the same place.</p><p>And she didn't say anything, but she gave me a sign not to say anything. And I loved my mother because she always loved me so much and I knew what kind of a person she was. So I was, when they started to ask me questions I said, "I don't know it." I lied too. Deliberately. And they started to beat me and I was screaming, and my mother heard me scream but she didn't say anything. And after I was beaten quite well, they, because we spoke Yiddish at home, and Yiddish is similar to German, they understood, that they said, "Gin-nook (ph)". Enough. <span class="page-break" number="12"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 4 standing, this was the last date when we were marched into the courtyard, you know? And Menachem Bacon was the President there. And I was overwhelmed with emotion to think from the gates of Auschwitz, to come now to the gates of Jerusalem and after so many, more than 2,000 years, to have our homeland, and then I understood already what it means to have our homeland, then people cannot tell you, "The houses are yours but the streets are ours." And I was overwhelmed. And I was so eager to go to march, and that march as a free person, as a proud Jew, but they asked me not to because they needed me to bear testimony in case I see something or to ask questions. And as the people are marching and I'm standing there, all of a sudden I said to myself, "Can I have a marker or a pen?" And I wrote on my badge, Fri-mand (ph), Check-hon-off (ph), Poland and Auschwitz. I figured in case somebody recognized, you know, walks by, they do not recognize me. I was 13 when the war broke out and now I am an adult. My name has changed.</p><p>Who will know me? And as I stand there, Kentel Vee-che-nya (ph) from Lindstrom, Pennsylvania (ph) was bringing the American flag as a gift to Menachem Bacon. And he looked at my badge, he said, "You're from Chair-hon-off (ph)?" And I said, "Yes, Chair-hon-off (ph).". And with him walked another man and he said, "I'm from Chair-hon-off (ph) too." And I said, "Who are you?" And he said, "Cal-hus (ph)." And I went berserk. I started to cry and to laugh and I was so excited and he had the matches, holding the cup, and the people who were interviewing him said, "Ask him for the address." So I asked him for the address and before he gave I said, "Are you the son or the father?" Because he looked too young to be the father. He said, "I'm Cal-hus's (ph) son." And he gave us a card, he lives in Natan-alia (ph), Israel because after the war he went to Israel, and he married an Israeli-Jewish . And we went there to interview him too. And I found out his father, unfortunately, died in Auschwitz, was murdered in Auschwitz. But he and another brother survived. And both are married and have children and grandchildren. And that's when I was understood, my grandmother's saying, that you only have what you give away. And that you don't have to be rich or famous and you can give away , good deed and your , and three generations. When I was in 1981, alive because of our sacrifice.</p><p>And that's when I learned spiritual resistance, from my mother. And I learned what is. What to do with humanness. And now you understand why I was sharing with you the lessons, what my mother said. doesn't depend, and then I'm going back to 1939, but I felt, I wanted to finish and complete the story so that you will know. Actually, Cal-fus (ph) invited us, our family, and there was a tremendous reunion. They took him and made him a part of the, you know, the interview. Anyhow, we are back in Chair-hon-off (ph) in 1939. After they took away from us all our freedom, they took away from us all our possessions. In the meantime, my grandmother died. That was before we went to the ghetto. My grandmother was no longer alive. And I was heartbroken because, except for my parents, I have never had as a close relationship with anyone as I had with my parents and with my grandmother. And she had such a great influence in this, I was heartbroken. But looking back, I am grateful that she did not have to go to what we went through and she died in her own bed and she was buried in Chair-hon-off (ph) and is there still. That was already, it was not as open, another kind of funeral that would be otherwise.</p></p></dialogue>

We couldn't make a traditional sha-but (ph), there was no food.</p><p>We lived in constant fear. And I saw, for instance, I think that I mentioned it, the religious people suffered more because they couldn't often and there was starvation.

And then was a big castle near the river, there was a castle.</p><p>When I lived there, it was empty, nobody lived in there. But a beautiful castle. In fact, I was now in Poland, it's still there, the castle is still there. I have a photograph of it. So, in the middle of the night, "All you-den rouse." With dogs, rifles, and they chased us out and they took us to the castle near the river. Lee-din-ya (ph) was called the river. And from there they put us on trucks and they took us to the ghetto, Nove" Mesto, Poland.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now who was with you at this place? Your entire immediate family?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My parents, my little brother and my little sister. That was all. My Aunt and Uncle and their children, they were the only ones that I saw still in the beginning, but when they chased us out they were not with us. So like I said, the only person that I said good-bye was my grandmother. The rest of the family we didn't know because to the other cities we couldn't even go, but them we would see occasionally. But when they chased us out, not until after the war I found out that when they chased us out they didn't chase out the whole city, they just chased out part. I don't know whether it was the larger or the smaller but the rest they chased out later, so my Aunt must have been, and her family with them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you have any sense of why you were chosen to go at that point verses another family?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I didn't even know that we were, that somebody was left. Because they chased us out in the middle of the night. We didn't have a chance to talk to anybody. Not until after the war did I find this out.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So they sent you to this other town?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They sent us to other town which was called Nove" Mesto, they changed the names, everything was changed. And Nove" Mesto, where previously lived one family, they put in six, seven and eight families. And the ghetto, you know, I don't have to explain to you what a ghetto is, we were isolated from the whole city. And it was so terribly crowded. And there, where we lived in was a family, the family which lived there was called Yat-rack (ph), and when we came there the facilities were not much better, like in ours. And so many families with little children, and everybody wanted to be able to go to the stove or use the facilities and everything. So, it was already horrible just being so crowded. And one time, my mother and father said to us, "Kindle-left (ph) children, get together the few belongings, we are leaving." And I thought to myself, are they loosing, have they lost their minds? Where are we leaving? It's a ghetto. We cannot go out. But we were, knew to respect our parents so we obeyed. And we went to a place where was before a storage for grains.</p><p>And it was empty, it was a dirt floor and nothing there, just a small window and a door. And my parents went, there were many ruins and they got together some bricks and by themselves they built a little stove. But what they said is still clear and vivid in my mind. They said, "At least here we'll have, it's enough that the Nazis destroy us from the outside. Here at least we'll have a little bit more peace and we'll be together. But it won't be because the fighting, the screaming, the children crying.</p><p>So we'll live there, right here, in this storage room." Exactly, and the conditions of the ghetto, I don't think I need to go in because its very clear at this point.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Okay. This ghetto, to my knowledge, was not like the Warsaw ghetto where there was physical resistance, of fighting. In fact, there was some ghetto, it was not as large a ghetto. What I remember is that we were constantly hungry. And my mother tried from the little meal that we had, she tried to make meals and many times what she did, she would take a little of hers, she would give to the smaller children because they couldn't endure so much. We wanted the parents, if the parents wanted to protect the children, she still was trying to read poetry and to sing songs, she still had the books, and she says, "We must, as long as we live, we must go on like a clock.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But you could wander freely on the streets in the ghetto?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In the ghetto, people tried not to wander around too much because they didn't want to, they wanted to avoid to be visible. Not to get hit because the Nazis had a tendency to torture, to mock us. In fact, for that reason, we tried as much to stay out of sight. I remember that I was mostly trying to be inside, like I felt safer to be inside.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did the Nazis come into the ghetto? Do you remember seeing people in uniform inside the ghetto?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. But not constantly. I don't know why I have so little recollection of the ghetto. That is not too much, I was a whole year in the ghetto. It was exactly October 15, 1941. They chased us from home. And the ghetto, the entire ghetto was liquidated on November 17, 1942. About a year later.</p><p>What I remember is that when, again in the middle of the night, I don't know why, but when we were chased off it was in the middle of the night. But this time we were told, they got us all together, and we were told that we're going to be resettled to a family camp where we are going to have better conditions. Where we are going to have food and medications and where the families are going to be together and work. And people were happy that we're going to have better medical conditions and better food. And then they took us all and they put us in the cattle cars. I still had. .</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was happening in the cars?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: What was happening in the cars? It was hot. We were hungry. We were thirsty. People were crying. People were praying. People were screaming, going crazy. We had no choice, we had to relieve ourselves in front of other people. Starvation. Fear. Where are we going? How long are we going to go? Where they are taking us? They promised better conditions, when is it going to be? And I remember parents tried to comfort, when we arrive there things are going to get better.</p><p>And in the meantime, people were fainting. People got sick. It was just a living Hell.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: As a young girl do you remember what was going on in your mind, what you were thinking about?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: What was going on, I was clinging to my parents. And I was wondering, what's going to happen? And I was crying because I saw my little brother and sister so hungry and I had nothing to give them. The parents wanted to protect us, we want to protect the parents. And we saw older people, we were always told by my parents and my grandmother, may she rest in peace, that we always help those who are less fortunate but here we were all less fortunate. And the worst thing was that we couldn't help each other too much. We were all in the same condition. There was no relief, no relief. And just, I kept on thinking about, I wanted to turn my mind off so I was trying to think of stories but the hunger took over. We were sleepy, there was no place to lay down. It was the most horrible journey. It was a horrible journey. And then, after five days like this, the stench, the tiredness, you know? The Holocaust for me, it was not,</p><p> was nothing to compare to what we suffered. But the worst suffering was that we, I <span class="page-break" number="17"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't know their exact age, they were younger than I but I just go by because I know that my little sister, when the Nazis came in she hadn't start yet school. And my brother wasn't yet barmitzvah, so I don't know their exact age. It was, at home we didn't celebrate birthdays like here because for the Jewish people didn't, some people didn't want to say their age because they believe in the evil eye and things like this. I don't know, superstitious. But anyhow, they were still young.</p><p>So when they took them away, my mother was with me, and everything went so fast that I didn't even have time to think. And then my mother turned to me and she said, "Yit-cola (ph), you're a big girl. I have to go with the little children. But remember my child, no matter what's going to happen to you, don't become hateful and bitter. Don't let them destroy you." That was her last words. And all of a sudden I was all alone. And that's it, everything that I had, everything, because I was became dead. And I didn't even have a chance to say good-bye because I didn't know that we are parting forever. I didn't know about gas chambers, nothing. My personal experience, nothing can historically, I never knew about gas chambers. When you saw that we were deceived.</p><p>Deceived, we didn't know. So then they lined us up and we were taken into the, a different way.</p><p>And they left for the barracks. And they took them away. I didn't know at that time where, I had no idea. Now when I know what's happened, but I mean, at the time when they took us away we didn't know. And they took away all older people, young children, pregnant woman. So I talk to myself, I remember it today, look how kind they are because we were told that we were all going to be together. So we thought that they give them a ride, which I appreciated very much. I figured the little children, but I had no idea that we are parted forever. Who could know that doctors who were trained to say the Hippocratic oath, that are trained to heal the sick are going to kill their health. In fact, I wrote a poem about Mengelia. Would you like me to say it?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. Anyhow, when they took us away all of a sudden they brought us into a place and we were, they shaved, first of all they made their number. We had to give up everything. I remember I was clutching a little picture, a photograph of my family, and I had to give it up. At first I didn't want to so they started to beat me so I figured its not worth it to, you know? I knew that I'm not going to be able to keep it so I gave it up. And we had to...</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. 2-5-6-7-3. Not everyone got numbers. The ones who they took away to the gas chambers, they didn't get numbers.

And I remember they were holding hands, you know, my little brother and sister. My brother was protecting my little sister, they took them away. And then my mother saw them going away. I don't know how much she know, what she knew, but again her , she made a fatal choice and <span class="page-break" number="18"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 1 We don't even have, you understand why this story of Buncho (ph) the Silent, I was thinking.</p><p>Because, I don't know whether it was just coincidental that this story had such an effect on me and why I remembered because Buncho (ph) the Silent in the story was 13 years old, when the step- mother came. And also I was many times thinking that we live for so long, since about the 1600 century my ancestors came to Poland. And yet, we had to leave everything. Everything that was ours they inherited, they took away everything. Nothing was ours. And, you know? And then when we came there, they shaved our heads, everybody had shaved heads. The guys, it was done too. And then we were the fortunate ones, at that time we didn't know because good and bad fortune can only be understood in retrospect. So I didn't realize that I was still lucky, that I got the number. At least I'm alive with the number. And then we really got a bath, we didn't get gassed, but obviously, or I wouldn't be here to tell you this. But we got a bath, which we welcomed because a shower was, you know? And then we went out for, a whole full of the floor was laying uniforms.</p><p>And they were striped, the same thing as we saw with the ones who came to the train. And, not from the Nazis, this was also hefflinger (ph), which means Jewish people who were interred there.</p><p>And then they gave us those uniforms and they took away our shoes. Everything was taken. Our clothes, our shoes, our hair, our name. Everything. And all of a sudden, I realized that to them I was just a number. And I remember that at the time, when they called, you know they never called us by name but number, in order to dehumanize us, that we should give in and give up. They always would call my number, which was 2-5-6-7-3 [in German], and whenever they say that I always would say under my breath, "Yit-cola (ph)". Because I thought to myself, how can I be a number? I can feel, I can think, I can laugh. Of course I didn't have freedom but I had freedom of mind, freedom of thoughts. And so I, this was my spiritual form of resistance. That I refused to see myself through their minds. And after they gave us the, instead of my shoes, which was a nice pair of shoes too, they gave us wooden clogs. And mine, unfortunately, were not matching. And we got an enamel bowl. And this was all our worldly possessions. In one day our entire past was wiped out. And we had no future. We didn't know it then yet. I didn't know about gas chambers yet. And they marched us into a barrack.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Let me ask you one question here. Was there anyone in this group you knew from before? Did you know some people from your town?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Sure. We came with people from our town who were in the ghetto.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, older meaning three years older, or?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In the ghetto, I mean, in the concentration camp there was pretty much solidarity. However, I had one bad experience. And I'll come to it. So when they gave us, and we always had to march to line up, never, since I came in on November 22, 1942, until Auschwitz was resolved, until January 18, 1945, I had no longer freedom. No freedom. We were, everything, because from the morning we woke up, we came in the barrack, it was a real big, long barracks. And was three <span class="page-break" number="19"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 2 but probably the most horrible was losing everyone I loved. And not only experiencing my own suffering, but witnessing the suffering of others and have to be silent like Buncho (ph) the Silent.</p><p>And I couldn't say anything. And in the barracks, where I could say something when the Nazis were not there at night, it was like the Tower of Babel. Because everyone spoke a different language. And we were too tired, too grieved in the beginning. So when we came in, so many people were crowded in this barrack. And all of a sudden, from a happy sheltered loving home to be thrown into an environment like this. And everybody was suffering. My first concern was, when is our family going to come? But I still was naive enough to believe what the Nazis told us, that we are going to get united. So I'm waiting. And I don't see them. So I start asking questions.</p><p>And there is a conspiracy almost like, so silent. Whether they didn't want to tell us because they didn't want to break my heart, or whether they were not allowed to? This I don't know, but whoever I asked nobody answered anything. They didn't say yes or no, nothing. Finally, after constantly badgering and repeating, one of the girls said, "You might as well tell her. We are all here condemned to die." And she points at the smoke and she said, "You see that chimney? This is where your parents are." And tells me the story about the gas chambers. She said, "This is where we're all going to be." Remember I related a story, it was when I was a child, I went to the funeral, my parents took me to the funeral and they told me that, to take your own life is a sin. It's like spitting God and your parents in their face because they gave you a gift and its against the Jewish law. So I did not for once think about committing suicide. But at that moment, if I would have been able to die when I found this out, that's how horrible my grief was. And I just was ready to give up. I was not trying to think about committing suicide, but I became oblivious. I didn't care what's happening. And anyhow...</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How long do you think you were there before you realized this? Or before you were told this?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I didn't know the first day.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was it a few months?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no, not months. It was in a few days. The exact day I don't know. Not very long, not very long. Because I was constantly asking and badgering the girls. And I'm going to go in later to describe what a day in Auschwitz was, but for now, they gave us the ration bread and I felt like, its like a funeral for me. I lost everybody. So I didn't, couldn't, I was starved but I couldn't eat. So I took the bread and left it. In the morning my bread was gone. And one of the girls there, I don't remember her last name any longer, Esther I know was her first name, she was from Chair-ta-hoff (ph) and she actually came from a prison. I don't know whether the prison was during the war because from what I know she was not a criminal, so maybe she, the Nazi laws were different than our laws. For keeping on, for wanting to practice our religion, for wanting to live. To <span class="page-break" number="20"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 3 if you didn't get up for the or the counting, if you didn't obey the law for anything, you would right away be killed, taken to the gas chambers. So a girl walks over and she ask me, "Why are you crying?" And I didn't care at all, I was so, so heartbroken, that I just started crying. I just didn't even want to answer. Finally she, it was something in her voice, that I felt that like she's caring, which I started to understand and I remembered what my grandmother use to say, "Yes my child, but kindness and caring cannot be little things." Like when I did the . And what's happened? And finally I tell her. And she said, she thought that I cried because of the bread, I cried of the whole situation, of losing the family and everything. So she took a piece of her bread and she broke it off and she said, "Take it." And I didn't want to take it. Because I already knew that we are all there to be killed, that it's just a matter of time. So I figured I cannot afford to get involved with anybody, to care for someone, to have a relationship, because in case one of us goes, there's going to be additional pain, to protect myself from the pain. But there was something in her voice and her face and everything. Her name is Benack (ph), at the time, was Binna Gold-cut (ph), Yanka Gold-cut (ph), because she use to call herself Yanka. And finally I took the bread and I said, "No, I cannot alone, no matter how long I'm going to live, alone. It's not even worth living. I'm all alone." I took the bread and Binna became my dearest friend. And from that day on, she became like my sister. We cared for each other. We cared deeply for each other and we helped each other.</p><p>In Auschwitz, a piece of bread meant life. Meant winning in the game of survival. So I just felt that she was so kind, that she was able to break up, and the contrast. Here, Esther stole my piece of bread. And this girl gave away a piece of bread. I didn't even know until this day, I don't know when she came, I didn't know at that time anything. Now I know that she was born in Warsaw, but I didn't know. At that time we didn't think of it. And I took the bread and with it something in my spirit started to soar again and we made a commitment, Binna and I. We didn't know if we were going to get out of there, but to live or to die with , with humanness.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You were beginning to tell me what an average day or a typical day in Auschwitz was like for you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We didn't wake up by the clock. We woke up, until this day I don't know what time, I know it was still dark. We would wake up and didn't have to dress because I slept in the shift, the same shift that we wore during the day. We didn't have any extra clothes. This was all that we had. And there was water but we were told that this is not good drinking water. So water was very scarce. We didn't have, we couldn't go to the bathroom when we wanted. It was like a collective bathroom, like the latrines you know? And it was just a wooden board and in it like cut out a piece. So we couldn't go where we wanted and this was a terrible thing because certain people, sometimes out of, there was such a terrible thirst or a hunger, that sometimes they would eat things that they shouldn't eat, or drink. And therefore they got diarrhea. And because the conditions, we couldn't wash up. We didn't have anywhere to wash. So it wasn't clean. And once you got the diarrhea, that was the end of you, because when you have diarrhea you have to run a lot and they wouldn't let you go and work. And if you soiled yourself, then when they made the selections, then you would go now. So it was important. And in order to feel a sense of freedom, since we couldn't wash, I could go through the movements of pretending that I'm washing myself, just to have some, to feel some freedom. So when I got up in the morning, it was dark and in the summer it was hot, winter was cold, and out of habit I was still saying the , | would still say the prayers, even in <span class="page-break" number="22"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 5 must feel. And I found out pretty soon that it was more dangerous to walk on the outside line so we tried to be in the inside line and not to be the very first or the very last. The less visible you could make yourself. And we marched. When I came I was assigned to Block 8 and a Turkish woman was our Block Elster (ph). A Block Elster (ph) had a little more privileges than the others, she didn't have to go out to work but she was responsible. And then we went out to work and I cannot estimate how long of time or how many miles because I had no way of measuring, but I know we worked snow, winter, sunshine, it didn't matter. And then we came to work. And we always worked outside the camp. And, outer-commando (ph) it was called, when you worked outside, outer-commando (ph). And what I started to realize is that the work we were doing at that time was not usual work. We would take stones or gravel and carry it from place to place and the Nazis used to mock us. And point to the gas chambers and they said, "See? That's where you're all going to come out." And then he said, "Where is your God now?" And that's when I remembered what my mother told me, when I had to go to the root cellar. "Go, Yit-cola (ph), go.</p><p>God is in the root cellar too." And I said to myself, "Go, Yit-cola (ph), go. You're the last one of your family. If you don't survive, the world will not know and it will be the last. It's like your family will not have existed. Go. God is here too. But man is not here. <span class="page-break" number="23"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 6 pretty good at that, you know? I was never heavy, which actually in Poland that was not looked at favorably. They use to say that she has consumption if you were thin. People were more, so anyhow, in no time I climbed up this tree, the tree, and I was, I dissed the person who was challenging me. And all of a sudden I hear somebody say, "Yit-cola (ph), Yit-cola (ph) your mother is coming." And I got scared and I remembered, my gosh, I'm wearing the good dress. And I went to get off the tree fast and the skirt, the pleated skirt got caught in a branch and I tore the skirt. I came down. My mother wasn't even there, it was just a prank they played on me. And I was in tears. And I said, "My God. My mother begged me not to take chances. Not to take a chance to lose something and now my dress is torn." And I remember like today, I took the pleats and I folded it over so it wouldn't show my flesh, because it was a big tear. And when I came into the house with tears in my eyes, my mother looked at me, she didn't have to ask much. All she said, "Take of the skirt." Because she saw the way I held it with tears in my eyes, so she put two and two together. "And I'll fix it for you." But she said, "Remember one thing. It's up to you. You can wear your old dress or the dress that I'll fix for you. But you're going to go to services." I was crying my eyes out because I didn't want to wear my old dress and I didn't want everybody to see that, what I did with this dress. But I remembered the lesson. Because my father always pointed out, in everything there is a lesson. In every experience. And what I remembered from that lesson is not to take chances with something I cannot afford to lose. And this was for me a terrific lesson because I knew one thing I cannot afford in Auschwitz, is to lose my life. So what I tried to do, many think rather than to take chances like grabbing a little soup, you know, although I was starved, I said no. I don't want to take chances because if they catch me they can kill me or beat me up so badly and if I cannot work they'll take me away. And I started to realize there how important it is, the upbringing, the influences that I had and the lessons I had. And mostly I saw, you see before the Holocaust I had no frame of reference with which to compare the things, the values, and the things or the blessings that I had. And then I had a chance to see what it is to be without a family, without a Jewish community, without the , we were always Jewish there, but we were not, <span class="page-break" number="23"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 7 words. And I was thinking to myself, my gosh, if this is, if this is our , 1 don't even have the word to express it, its like a different planet. It's in the same world like a different planet, a planet of destruction, of death. The dead were not buried and was mountains, everything was mountains. Mountains of dead bodies until they buried them. And constant living under the fear of maybe today they are going to take you away, and if you got sick you had no luck, there was no medication. Everything that they promised was not. And once I found out what they do with the people who come, that they take away, and I heard music playing. And I asked somebody, "Where is the music?" And that's when I found out that they have a live orchestra playing. When the transport was coming and they made selections, sending away people to the gas chamber, the music was playing. Classical music. And later, when I heard the music, I always started to cry because I knew that my people are burning, the music is playing. And you know, even after the Holocaust I always loved music and singing, but for a long time whenever I start to hear music, I started to cry because the visions of the little children, of everything separated and how they tore apart. And then, after a long day, again, walking through the gate, the selections. Some people got beaten to death.</p><p>Other people from working were injured, some people got sick. And every day there became lesser and lesser of us. And the bodies, more skeletal. And we didn't, couldn't take a shower or anything and we started to accumulate lice. So a big treat was when we could take off that dress and try to</p><p> to expose of the lice. And people with diarrhea, and it was just Dante's Inferno is a comedy comparing to what it was. That's what I say because you ask me, did I, it's impossible to describe everything. So we came back tired, frozen, cold, over heated from the heat in the whole day, we came back, again the appeal (ph), say appeal (ph) and check there, there to alive, we are there. And then we had to wait, after they count again they give us a little soup, a little bread. It wasn't enough to live and not enough to die. And many people, many, constantly people died. And seeing, here you was with somebody, a few minutes later they were gone. And constantly new transports, and you couldn't speak. So, and the filth, the starvation, the loneliness. Like I started before to tell you, is all this time not seeing yourself in a mirror, not having a toothbrush. They tried to dehumanize us to the point where we didn't even, I'm embarrassed to talk about it, but when I remember what my parents taught me, that my does not depend on how other treat me but how I treat others, than I'm not ashamed because I haven't done anything to deserve it. We didn't even have a piece of toilet tissue. All the time I was in Auschwitz, I couldn't have a piece of toilet tissue. This is how they deprived us. Not a spoon, not a fork, nothing. You know, they tried to reduce us to be like non-humans. And the mocking constantly and everything. So again, each day the same thing, over and over, starting the and just hanging on another day. Just if you could get through the day, not get beaten, not go to the gas chamber, go through the day and come home together with Binna, that's . And many times, people would go in the evening <span class="page-break" number="24"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 8 alive, I don't know what they did to her but hair was growing on her face so she had to go Electro- something, I forget how this is called, they had to take it off from her face. Hair grew like a man, you know? And different things. There were plenty, I know certain people who I personally know who got married but never could have children because of those experiments. And some got sick.</p><p>But the majority died, they didn't survive this here. Yes, and another thing. There was a , you know? So, and they sometimes Mengelia or other doctors would come and <span class="page-break" number="25"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 9 right to go to Hell and live and to suffer and to die there. So it was extremely, constantly living with pain to see that everyday there is less and less. And there was the son-day-commander (ph). And the son-day-commander (ph) was a group of Jewish prisoners in Auschwitz who were operating the involvement with gassing the people. And I didn't know it then but now, afterwards I found out, and almost I was in there. I returned to Poland and I went to the gas chambers now because I never saw a gas chamber inside. And what I, so we saw, I have photographs and I saw it by myself. The process that they had, that to tell the people that they are going to take a bath but instead to put on gas, this was out completely of my experience both historically and privately. I never heard this.</p><p>And not only that, everything that they took away that was ours became theirs . . .[end of side | of tape 3]... You know, all the values, all the many beliefs that I've been taught and many things, I had to tell them everything. It was not just the physically, but to tell them because I started to ask questions of myself. I said, what is education for if it leads to Auschwitz, to gas chambers?</p><p>Imagine. Not only did they took away our possessions, our homes, our traditions and everything, but a lot in Poland, gold teeth was our status symbol. Plus people did it to fix their teeth, but those who were wealthier used to make the crowns for the teeth, they put in gold teeth. So when the people were dead, before they went in they cut their hair and this was used for German economy, it was for mattress stuffing and everything. And I was thinking, we had straw mattresses. My parents didn't go to college, and my grandmother. But how did they live? I started to compare the values.</p><p>And then, is another thing, from the teeth they took away everything and they selected, the glasses, and every single thing they took away from every part of the body. From the skin, lamp shades and everything. So everything was, again, what is technology for? And this is why, when I got out, I could no longer have the same values. I had to tear down everything and to compare. What did my parents teach me? What did my grandmother teach me? What does my religion teach me? That the most important thing was a human life, to save one life, the Talmud teaches us, is like to save the whole world. And here was my mother who didn't have college degrees, was a extremely intelligent woman, well-red and intelligent and very artistic, but she didn't have college degree. And yet she resisted. She resisted both physically and spiritually. She did not give up Cal-fus (ph). And from one person that is now several generations of people. Can you imagine how many generations would be if they wouldn't have killed the six million? How many people? And one Mengelia could do so much damage. And that's when I started to realize, by going back. Not everything that I reflect while being there. Many things I reflected upon until this day. And I started to say, so I realized something very important. That four groups of people actually influenced my destiny.</p><p>Because the Nazis, the only reason why the Nazis did this to us is because we were born Jewish. I did not choose my parents and my parents didn't choose to die in the gas chambers, to be murdered.</p><p>They didn't die. They didn't die. They were murdered. Those who starved of starvation, those who were killed or those from diseases, they were murdered because they put us in those conditions.</p><p>And everything that was ours became their by brute force, by terror and by deception. And this is why I start about honesty. And then I started to realize, when I look back now, I realized also that there are some things you cannot buy without money but there are also some things we cannot buy for money. And those are the things that I miss the most. No money in the world can replace the six million Jewish people and five million non-Jewish people who were murdered by the Nazis.</p></p></dialogue>

Some could. The people who spoke Yiddish came very handy for me. Because in Europe not everybody, but those who came from religious homes, they could speak Yiddish. So it, as far as the guard, the people in the barracks I couldn't speak with everybody, nor did I have the energy, nor was there enough time. We came home, we were dead tired. And once we gave us the piece of bread we were lucky that we could lay down our heads because before we knew it, it was morning again.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Towards the end when they started to lose the war, there was more transport. They were bringing more people. It's like, it seemed to me from looking back now, that Hitler was determined to destroy everybody. He was also determined that there shouldn't be any traces. And another thing, which, see somebody would run away. Everything is relevant to conditions I've learned. For instance, if one girl would run away, there were a lot of obstacles. The first obstacle was that if one would run away the others would stay in until they found of that, we all would <span class="page-break" number="27"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 1 upbringing, I told you what my, this here had a very great influence. Plus I said, I will not collaborate in my own destruction. I did everything to try to keep myself clean, to keep myself, under the conditions. I even went through like the motions of washing myself just to feel and try to think, its ironic we were thinking, I remember that Binna and I was talking, said, if we're going to go out from here, once in my lifetime I want to still have a whole loaf of bread. That was my dreams. Dreams change. It was one of my dreams. When I was, before the Holocaust, I was dreaming of getting a good formal education, become a writer. When I was in Auschwitz, I was dreaming about once in my life, before I die, once to have the feeling of not going, my stomach should not turn from hunger, have cramps, hunger cramps. And the other dream was still to be free.</p><p>To be able to walk once in my lifetime still without the guards walking with me, with the guns and having to march. I-spy-dry-links (ph), I-spy-dry-links (ph), I still hear that in my head, the columns.</p><p>And to see people dying and suffering in a world of destruction when I was brought up to respect life. This was, and another thing that we were naive, and I see now that its not so, is that whoever goes out, if I have one dress, just a clean dress and someplace to put my head I will not ask for anything more, but if I have a loaf of bread, a clean dress. We wanted so little. But we still have not faced reality then because in concentration camp, in Auschwitz, I was with other people. And actually, even though the conditions were so horrible, somebody still took care, I still have someplace to, even that was the horrible conditions, but I had where to put my head down. And even though there was so little, hardly enough to get through the day, food, I still had somebody. So after age 13 I was never on my own. I never, I was protective, loving environment. Here completely alone except for Binna, which became my friend from, in Auschwitz. I didn't know her from before. And then, to go out in the world, I didn't face it because at that time all we had, all we were thinking about is of surviving. Of having the things, the things that I want. So at that time I wasn't thinking of other things. It's not until I came out that everything hit me.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When it started getting, more transports would come in. Did the conditions get worse or did they stay pretty much the same?</p></p></dialogue>

But what they did with them and the conditions there, this I found out afterwards. I also found out that the people who worked in the crematorium, every three months they would gas them too. Because they were most anxious that nobody should know. They wanted to wipe out every trace of the crime.</p></p></dialogue>

They could resist. They could say no. They couldn't maybe, when Hitler became so powerful, but they could have done that in the beginning.

First of all, you didn't have to work outside. The outside work was a killer. Many, many people died. I was young and maybe that helped me to survive, I don't know.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You were telling me about the work commando at Canada.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. In Canada we had to work also every day. My work consisted, and everybody's work actually consisted, we took apart the bundles and we had to select them. Put each item of the same kind in bundles and in places. Now, let me start with the advantage for me. The advantage was that I didn't have to work outside. I was shielded a little from the cold and from the heat. The work was easier than it was to drag the stones and everything else. And also I couldn't take anything from there but there were Nazis that were watching us too. But what I could do, occasionally but not always, nobody could see. Let's say if I found a piece of bread, I couldn't take it out but I could take a piece of it and eat it. So that provided a little extra food for me. Then there was something that they did that if it wouldn't be for what my mother taught me, that my does not depend on how others treat me but how I treat others, I would feel ashamed to tell this here. It's just like a woman who is raped, and it doesn't have a good self and she doesn't understand that it's the victimizer not the victim who is suppose to feel ashamed, then I would feel ashamed to tell you this here. But I don't. I feel pained. When we were leaving, every single day, the most humiliating, the most painful thing, they would search us internally so we wouldn't smuggle out any diamonds, any gold, because sometimes you did find those things there. So we couldn't take out anything. And that was so humiliating for me. A girl who was modest, who wouldn't even undress in front of her parents. And you know I was like a budding teen-ager when the Holocaust begun. And here, to go through, that sometimes I wish I would have still walked in the outside commando because each time they did this, I felt like I was dying by inches. It was so humiliating and so disgusting to have these Nazis to search me. So as far as this, if you heard stories that somebody smuggled out, that's not true. , maybe they didn't tell you, but they searched us. They searched us every inch, all over, even internally so what, how can you smuggle something out?</p></p></dialogue>

Couldn't wait to get, to lay down, to put down your head, it was so exhausted and cold. And sometimes, you know what was our, but that was not done deliberately, we slept so many on one bunk bed. So out of necessity of the overcrowdedness we slept on the side like I told you, close one another. So that was our, you know body gives out heat too. So we had one blanket, everybody was pulling in different direction. So laying, whoever was lucky was laying in the middle, felt less cold. So it was not, its an existence, not knowing.

If you stopped, if you fell, they shot you. If somebody fell or couldn't go you were not allowed to help them. So many people, there were plenty people who I saw on the way who was laying dead. And we could not do anything about it. This is the most, this probably, besides my own experience from my own suffering, this was the most horrible thing for me. To be human and not to be able to help another human being, if somebody falls.</p><p>Lived for so many years and then in that way to die? A lot of people died on the way. A lot of people died on the way. And we started to march on January 18, 1945 and we came to Ravensbruck. I'm thinking , | wrote down the date someplace.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: January 24 to February 11?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: February 11", right. January 18" we were chased and then we came six days later, the six-day march, and then we came in February 11". And there was also, this was the only concentration camp, death camp, on German soil that has also gas chambers.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: What was it like? Same kind of suffering, same kind of suffering still. They still didn't let go.</p><p>And I made a stew and Esther dead. They took us, this time we didn't have to walk already, they took us with trucks. And they brought us to another concentration camp in Malchow, Germany. In the Malchow, Germany they had no gas chambers.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You didn't work in Ravensbruck did you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not very much. It was not a long time. It was already confusion. Did some work but it was not already as extensive as it was in Auschwitz.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So in the daytime?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We did work but, yes we did work. I'm trying to think because I know I worked in an ammunition factory, but that was in Malchow. Because I remember we sabotaged a lot of the things there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, in Ravensbruck during the day . . .?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We did work. I don't remember exactly what type of work we did there. To an ammunition factory or something. There was not any Canada or anything like this here anymore. I don't remember. I don't have that many because Auschwitz, other towers, everything , this is why I, the others is, but I know that there was crematoriums. I was less shielded.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember any striking differences between Ravensbruck and Auschwitz?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It wasn't as huge. I didn't hear the orchestra playing so that was the, and there wasn't so many people. And I didn't stay so long so there I have, when I speak even though I was there but I must not speak of Auschwitz because that's where, it was the last day when I came with family, that was the last day on earth for my entire family. Thousands of Jews from the ghetto Nove Mesto including my friends and relatives. And the first day of , that's why Auschwitz <span class="page-break" number="36"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0 fortunate they didn't get sick because if you got sick it's the end. I don't remember Ravensbruk (ph) in as many details but I know it was, the people there was more Polish people in Ravensbruk (ph).</p><p>A lot of Polish people and some were a little older too. So it seems like they allowed older people maybe more there to come.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So then they took you to Malchow?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And they took and brought me to Malchow. And I came there with Binna too. And there, to my recollection, there was no gas chambers anymore. We still were treated badly, we still had little food. The only good better thing was, and we went every day to work, and the conditions were horrible. The only better thing was for me personally, for Binna, that we didn't work outside.</p><p>Because outside, winter or summer, without clothes, the proper clothes without. That was, and we worked inside and we, there I remember exactly what, an ammunition factory. And I know that they gonna use this ammunition maybe against us or other people so whenever we could sabotage something we did.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: How? You know, like if you're suppose to put it on this way you put it in the opposite. I didn't have any tools or anything to sabotage it but not to do it. And if you could work slower we worked slower, you know, the productions. And we knew, whatever we can we didn't want to do to help the Nazis. To help them to succeed.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was anybody, of the prisoners, kind of organizing this? Sort of advising people what to do? Or you just thought this up on your own?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: With what?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: With the sabotage.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was a pretty veiled conception. We all wanted all the time but what could we do? We couldn't. In Auschwitz I couldn't, what could I sabotage?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But here did people talk about it? Did they, when you were new there did people who were already there make suggestions or you just figured it out?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Some word would get out and some we saw other people doing it. It was not discussed, we were afraid to talk. You know, somebody, you never knew who can hear us or something. But we saw that whenever we could, not to do properly or something, then we did it. If it would be, I don't know. Knowing myself, I don't know, if I had opportunity to damage the Nazis, that I don't know if I could do. But the things that helped them to kill people, that I did with good conscious.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And enjoyed doing it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Not a question enjoyed, but almost felt like a responsibility. It felt that, they used everything for destruction, you know? People can be creators or destroyers of life. Everything can be used for good and evil. That is the education, I was dreaming about a formal education but I tell you, there is no substitute for personal experience. And what this experience in the concentration camp taught me no professor, no text books, no school could teach me. Because there you had the consequences of your action. When, learning, book learning is important but it doesn't have consequences. It's not the same thing. It's one thing to read about slavery than being a slave. It's one thing about losing, if somebody lost a family, than losing your own. Same thing about suffering, about believing from that my ancestors were in Egypt, its different when you go on yours. <span class="page-break" number="37"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 1</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well I can tell that Malchow? I just felt everyday, everyday was like you want another lease on life. I know that the worse the condition got the longer it took. We tried to encourage each other again, maybe tomorrow, don't give up, hold on. That was like a , don't give up. Don't give them the victory, don't give them the final victory. And we just went, we knew we were trapped and we were hoping for a miracle. And not knowing if its going to happen. It just went on.</p><p>Worked and another day, another day, not knowing what's going to happen.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now at this point did you have a little bit more information about the war?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Still?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We didn't have contacts with anyone. From 1942, until I came to concentration camp. Actually from the ghettos we knew nothing, until I came to the ghetto, before the ghetto I could still hear rumors or something but nobody, we didn't have, who could tell us? The only people that we saw when I was in concentration camp is the inmates and the Nazis.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I just figured that maybe at this point you might have some sense that you had been moved into Germany .. .?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No I didn't because I didn't know. Because, I had been told not to build, not to assume. An assumption is different from a fact. So I didn't know, so I didn't make any assumption. I just hoped and prayed and tried to hold on for as long as I could. That's all.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How long were you there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was there until I was liberated on, during Passover, April 26, 1945.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What happened?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: What happened? That's an interesting story. I woke up one morning. No : Commotion. And then the Swedish Red Cross came to save us. Not everybody. They took out mostly those who were sick and by that time I was pretty sick. And Binna and I, and a few other people, there was a girl, Franya Gilman (ph), she was also on our truck. And ironically, being deceived by the Nazis about this, Red Cross. When I saw this Red Cross I was afraid to go up. But you know, people convey messages by words, by their emotion, by their body language. And those people didn't seem like Nazis. First of all, they didn't wear the uniforms. And I felt that this is not, but at first there was fear to go up. But, so they took us on the trucks. From on the date that I gave you and the war was still going on because it didn't finish officially. So a bomb, a part of a bomb fell in our truck and it hit Franya Gilman (ph) and Franya Gilman (ph) had to have her foot amputated. That was already toward the end, on the way. And from there we traveled from Germany to via Copenhagen.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I want to ask you a question before you continue. When you say you saw the Swedish Red Cross, where were the Nazi guards? Where were the Germans at this point?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I didn't see the Nazis. I don't know what's happened to them. I didn't see anybody. All of a sudden I didn't see, in the commotion, we didn't know, something . And frankly I didn't know what was going on. I didn't know if I should be happy or should be unhappy, I didn't know what was going on. But then they came and they helped me. By that time I was pretty sick.</p><p>And they helped me to come to a truck, they helped me up. And we came to, we traveled. It took a whole day. At night I remember we were in a barn, in Copenhagen, Denmark, Copenhagen.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you take a boat?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no. By bus. Not bus, by trucks. Trucks also. But not such a, not with Nazis anymore. And I didn't know what to think, I felt sick and I didn't know already but I saw from the way they touched us because the Nazis never would touch us because we were full of lice and</p><p> . And those people seemed to be kind and we came Denmark. So we stayed <span class="page-break" number="38"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 2 over night in a barn. And after that they brought us to Lund, Sweden. A university city, to a hospital. And I was alive but I had no home to live in so the hospital, they gave me my first home after liberation. But before we went in we had to strip again, naked, throw away the tattered concentration camp shift, and we got a bed. And after all those years, nearly six years, I saw myself in front of the mirror. I couldn't speak a lot of Swedish, or understand. I was stateless, homeless, penniless, jobless. Unlike my non-Jewish fellow survivors, I couldn't go back home to my family, to my relatives, to my friends because Jewish home, Jewish families and Jewish communities were destroyed. I had no one left, to help me, to love me, to wait for me, or to miss me. But I missed terrible, everybody. And I remember the shock I got when I saw myself for the first time in the mirror. I didn't know myself. I didn't see myself all those years. And it was no sign of womanhood. Another thing, during this Auschwitz I didn't get my period. Until this day, I don't know the reasons why. That was malnutrition or whether they were putting something in the food?</p><p>I would suspect its malnutrition. And I didn't know if I am going to be like a normal woman. And when I saw myself in the mirror, I started to scream. The nurses didn't know what's happened. And I didn't know how to explain. [end of side 1 of tape 4] Anyhow, I, it was a coincidence because I was born during Passover and I was liberated during Passover. And I had less, I had more on the day when I was born than the day of liberation. Not a tangible shred was left of my pre-war childhood world. Not a single document, not a family annual, not a photograph, nothing. And the Swedish people in the hospital were very kind. Very, very kind, very caring. And to me, if I didn't get beaten that was already a lucky day. Because then I started to realize I didn't know anything what was happen, with Hitler, I didn't know what's Germany, I didn't know how the war is. I was away from the war for nearly six years, not having any contact, isolated from the whole world. Not reading, not knowing anything. I only knew what I sensed, what I felt and what I, by comparison.</p><p>And I talked to myself and I started to realize how one person can make a difference. This was Gentile people and this was Gentile people. One destroyed so many of my people, the other saved them. And I started to understand many, many things. Not immediately, because in the beginning I was too sick to think and it was lonely. Binna fortunately survived too. At what point I realized...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That you were actually free?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: When I was with the Swedish Red Cross. Then I started to realize, when we were going, when we came to Copenhagen and I saw that they treat us, it was like between night and day, the contrast.</p><p>They treat us kindly, the others treated us cruel. They took care of us.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you felt you were able to trust them?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: At first I was afraid to go because I didn't know. What the Red Cross represented to me destruction of so many people at first. But then I didn't see any Nazis. I wasn't, I was naive, I was young but I wasn't completely stupid. And I could see that, the difference of the way they treated us and, you know? They fed us.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What did it feel like, being liberated?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was a tremendous shock, a tremendous, the transition was not, I didn't, all the time I dreamt about being free but the every day struggle to survive, to get through the day, not to be put to the gas chambers, not to be maimed, not to be, health, and to live. It was the struggle to survive so that you couldn't think about all the other things. You were with everybody together. Many people together, we were on the same boat like we used to say. But when we were liberated, and when I came there, I couldn't speak the language. I was 19 years old. I couldn't understand a word of anything. A stranger in a strange world. Not having anyone. And all of a sudden, in the beginning right away I didn't even think so much. I was too sick, too tired, the shock was very much. But then the very This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was in the hospital there. I was getting good care. The contrast was a sharp contrast from the way the Nazis treated us here. And I remember one thing I was thinking, if this is, I remember I was seeing the differences because I always had the ability because I was creative to compare. I said, "This is Gentiles and this is Gentiles." So good and evil, no one has a monopoly on it. It has more to do with the . With who you are as a human being. What you believe about yourself, about God and about others. That effects your behavior. And therefore, I realized even more what my mother's last words, don't become hateful and bitter, don't let them destroy you, I realized what tragedies and hatred is. And the more the Nazis tortured me, the more I was determined never to become like them, to view myself through their eyes. And here I saw kind people. I had a very, very wonderful memories. Very, very grateful to the Swedish people, the way they helped me. They helped me to get on my feet. I have nothing. I came in, like I said, I had more on the day I was born. Here I went in the hospital, I came in nude because they couldn't allow this filthy dress to come in this here, the first thing, we came in and took the showers and they helped me to bathe, covered, nurse me back to health. And for this I will be always grateful because I learned not to take anyone or anything for granted. Because its very easy to lose everything. And we stayed in the hospital and then, I think I gave you all the dates, right?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well I don't know... .</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Otherwise I have everything, I have it all written down.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I don't know how long you were in the hospital, I just know that you arrived in Lund on April 28%.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right. Because on the 26" I was liberated. On the 27" I was in Copenhagen. The 28" J arrived.</p><p>And at that time, when I started to get healthy I started to examine and to re-evaluate everything.</p><p>What is it? Who is responsible? And basically what I was interested is, in the beginning, to regain my health. I started concentrating on regaining my health because I realize that health is wealth, health is important because if you're sick and you are alone, you cannot do very much. And I was very much aware that I no longer have anyone to love me, to protect me, to take care of me. So I needed to become my own parent and start taking care of myself. Of course, Binna and I were still very devoted and very loyal to each other and we were each other's family at the time. And I was there in the hospital, I got very good care. I also was always fortunately a good student and always loved language, words. I always realized the power of words, so I was very eager to learn Swedish.</p><p>So while there, I started, they were very kind to me, they gave me a dictionary and I started to learn a little bit. And to recover. And I was in Lund, Sweden until May 7, 1945. From there I was sent to Dod-ug-stup (ph) in Sweden. It's called Dod-ug-stup (ph), it's you know? And this was DP Camp, which in Swedish is called . On Rinks-vagen (ph) 20 B, that <span class="page-break" number="40"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 4 me that way, and he asked me, and in the broken Swedish with the dictionary, I understood that when I get allowed, when I will be allowed to get out from the quarantine, will I go on a date with him. And that was the first date of my life, okay? So I was very excited and anxious. I didn't know how I'm going to know how to behave with a man, I didn't see a man for all those years. I didn't have any experience in dating and mating. I went out with him. It was a very, very painful experience for me. Because as soon as we started to talk, and not very much, he paid me a compliment, you don't look Jewish. And that was like a knife in my, twisted in my heart. Here I suffered so much and I'm not Jewish? And again, he doesn't see me as a human being. Yes, I'm not denying my Jewishness, I'm proud to be who I am. Would I be born a Gentile, I would be proud to be Gentile, but I'm born, I didn't make choices about this. It hit me so hard, and I don't believe he meant it in a bad way, in a malicious way. He was a kind person. But for somehow he reminded me who I am, not that I ever forgot it. And I said, "Good-bye." Excuse myself with tears in my eyes and I left. And I made a decision. Never will I go out with somebody who is not Jewish because I'm the only link left, the only daughter left of my family. I cannot do it to my family or to my people or to myself. And in our camp there, in the DP Camp, was a woman which was called, we called her , means she was a Rabbi's wife, so the husband is a Rabbi, she is <span class="page-break" number="40"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 5 restoring, to get us used to a normal life, if you can call it normal. And so there was not much, we rested basically. We didn't do very much. It was more recuperating. It was like a convalescent home you would go from a hospital, that sense, except better because we were already, we were not invalids.</p></p></dialogue>

At that point it was just plain start putting us a little in the, now when I came to Hem-shed (ph), we observed strictly the Shabbat.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I didn't go to Poland. I didn't have the means, I didn't have the strength, I didn't have the know- how, I didn't have the money, I didn't have anything. I just stayed, this is why later, towards the end, I'm going to just make a summation and you are going to see why I realized that, I'll talk about this later because then its going to make more sense than now. Anyhow, so when we went to work here, we came, that was my first job. Freedom by choice. Until that date, whatever I did is where they sent me, even to go into , to the kosher , the DP camp. I don't know if we didn't call it, we called it . I didn't even know that it exist, DP camp, <span class="page-break" number="42"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 7 dishes", she answered. And I said, "There will always be dishes in our hospital, but it's my half a day off." Because I was thinking, if she would have asked me I would have gladly stayed. Because then I have a choice. But when I'm ordered I have no choice. And if I accept it once, the beginning is the most important, than I'm going to have to do it all the time. And I'll lose my freedom and I'm not ready to, after Auschwitz, never again will I give up my freedom willingly.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you afraid to say no?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Nope. And I marched out. After Auschwitz I'm not afraid of anything. Just to do something to disgrace myself or my family. Other things I'm not afraid. What can scare me after Auschwitz?</p><p>And as soon as I walked out, and I came to my room, this so-called good manager comes in and she says to me, "Itka, I heard what's happened. But would you do it for me? Go back?" And I had mixed feelings. The heart said one thing, the head said another. But I went back. Walking on the way, everything in me revolted. I said, "I'm sorry, I can't do it." I started to cry and I run back in and I didn't go in. I had been taught as a child that never make serious decision, long range decision when you're under emotional strain. So I told myself, I said, suppose I left? Where am I going to go? I have no home. The only option is to go to Mr. Pound and I don't want to do that. To be a burden for them. What future is there for me? It also meant to leave Binna, to separate from Binna.</p><p>Because I didn't dare ask her, come with me, when I have nothing to offer. Not a place, not an apartment, not a job. So I said, no, I can't do it. So I went to the good boss and I told her how I feel about it, and I said, "Listen. I have no home and no place to go. But I am a survivor of a concentration camp. I got so much abuse that I promised that I will never allow anybody to abuse me again or give up my freedom. So I will gladly stay because I don't have any other place to go.</p><p>Give me any job. I don't mind scrubbing toilet. Job doesn't scare me. I was working carrying stone and things. But I want to be treated with dignity. If somebody wants something from me, let them ask. And if I can I will gladly give, but I don't take orders anymore." And she said, "I'm sorry. I would gladly do it but she has been working for me for 36 years. I can't afford to lose her." After that I had no longer to think. So I figured, so again not justice. It's just for convenient forme. At that point I said, whatever is involved, whatever risk, I must take it. I went in with tears in my eyes, I said good-bye to both my friends. They didn't offer to come and I didn't ask them. At that time I didn't even consider, I didn't even, now I am thinking, how come I didn't offer to come Binna? I wouldn't let them anyhow, but they didn't. You know, everything went so fast. And I picked myself up and I went. Like Buncho (ph) the Silent. Went to the world with no one, an orphan, with no one to care. And when I came to the train, they asked me where do you want to go?</p><p>End of Tape 4.</p><p>This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: At the last tape you were getting ready to get on a train for somewhere.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Somewhere. And when I came to the train, running not walking, because I want to make the train. I didn't have too many belongings to take with me, I didn't have very much. And I didn't even have time to buy the ticket at the office, at the station, but I boarded on the train. And the conductor asked me, "Where are you going?" I said, "To the nearest, largest city". Because I didn't know Sweden at that time, I hadn't been around yet. So he said, "Boss (ph)? Boss (ph), Sweden? You know Boss (ph)?" I said, "Okay." And that's where I learned. When I came into Boss (ph), Sweden, I did not know a single soul. [had no home. And all of a sudden it dawned on me. Where am I going now? Now lam completely alone. No family, and not even friends. My two friends are also without me. Where am I going to sleep? What am I going to do? And I walked quite a while, mostly I was completely oblivious of time, I didn't know, and in desperation, when I started to realize my situation, that I have nothing. I have no money. I have no home. I'm a homeless person and I'm all alone. Even as bad as it was in concentration camp, I knew this is where I'm going to sleep at night. Here, I don't have anything. And I must admit I was concerned. And all of a sudden I looked up to Heaven and I found myself praying. And I remember exactly what I said, inside myself. Dear God, I am all alone and I am helpless. I'm in your hands. Guide me. I don't want to do something to disgrace myself or my family. And I had been walking, I don't know how long, and then all of a sudden I thought that I hear somebody saying, "Yit-cola." I said, am I losing my mind? I'm hearing voices? And again I hear repeating, "Yit-cola.". And I look around and a girl from concentration camp recognized me. She lived in Boss (ph). And I tell her my story and she said, "Don't worry. We are concentration camp survivors. We can share whatever we have. Come up." And I stayed overnight. She directed me how to go to the unemployment office, the next day, and I went. They asked me, did you work before? I told them, yes. Why did you leave? I said, "I tell you the truth, there's no young people. And I wanted to start a new life. There was nobody for me to associate with." Which was not a lie. But that was not the only reason because eventually I would have left anyhow. But it didn't dawn on me. She asked me to come back, that she's going to check out my story. Because I wasn't used to telephones yet because I didn't have a telephone. And she checked out the story and when I came back, she asked me, "Why did you try to protect her?" And I said, "Listen. I didn't leave, I'm not going to gain anything by making her look bad." You know, my manager from the kitchen. "I just don't have a future there. And I left for this reason, but I also eventually would have left anyhow because there is no life for me." And I told her a little bit, not much, but I told her that I have two friends who stayed there and I want to be with them, can she find a job for me, for them too? And she did find me a job. However, in Sweden was a custom.</p><p>That you only, if you worked for somebody they provided you with an apartment. You paid for it but if you stopped working you no longer could use that apartment. So I went to work and, when I had already a job for the three of us, and an apartment, I got in touch with my friends and I brought them over. With Regina it didn't work out too well because there was, two is okay, four is okay, three is a little part in our relationship. Because Binna and I, except for underwear, shared everything. Even after we were liberated. It wasn't mine and yours. Money, time, work. She felt better if she did for me, if I did better I did for her. So we were like sisters. Regina wasn't, she was more, she was a nice girl but, like, this is mine, this is yours, and we were not accustom because even in Auschwitz we shared. So we decided that she's going to have for herself a room. So we were on the second floor, was also a little room. So Binna and I shared one room, she <span class="page-break" number="44"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 9 I was still accustom to do, I knew a little bit how to cook because when I was at home I used to help my and my parents, you know? Chop this and . . . so I knew that my mother tried to teach me everything, what she could, and I would, we would make meals together. And every day somebody would go take turns, one day Binna would go and warm up the food a little early and I did, I had a day when I didn't feel so good she would help. We were really devoted to each other.</p><p>And one day, I was walking home from work and I was rushing. I was always very fast and energetic. And bingo, I'm on the ground. And I feel that from the elbow, from the back, somebody's helping me up. I turn around. And it was a man. I thanked him and he starts talking to me and he notices that I have an accent. And we start talking and he had an accent too and we found out that we are both survivors of the Holocaust. And he tells me that he lives on the same street, he asked me where I lived, I told him, the same street. But he lives in a hotel and I was, I got a small apartment. He helped me home and he tells me that his father was, not a , but you know like a self-made F . There used to be a lot of people like home-made remedies and he was going to clean up my knees and bandage, I was still, even though I went through Auschwitz, but I still was not the kind of girl that would let him see my knees, you know? So I said, no thank you. And I warmed up the food and offered him some food. And he said it smelled nice and everything, and he said, "Oh, I would gladly pay to have a meal like this." And I said, "I don't run a restaurant. However, if you want to have a home-made meal, during the week we work, I don't have the time, but on Sunday you're welcome. Binna and I is going to be home. You can come up and have dinner with us." His name is in Yiddish, Avrum Schmol-lev-itz (ph), now he called himself Abe. And Avrum Schmol-lev-itz (ph) started to come. I don't know how I should call it, to date me? But he would come constantly visiting. Showed a great interest in me. I liked him very much as a friend. Very loyal, well devoted, caring. But I didn't have any feelings for him otherwise. And he was coming to our home for almost a year. Now, at that time, they sent to Sweden, when we came to Sweden, all the women were there. . There were other women from Sweden too, that were survivors. But the men they sent in other places. So there were only two men in our city. So there was no prospect for somebody to find, you know? So everybody, Binna and everybody else is saying, "Itka, you're so lucky. You have a man who likes you so much." And, I don't know, I never talked with him about love because I certainly didn't love him. I loved him as a human being, as a good person, but no otherwise. And I remember that Binna said, "Oh, I would be lucky to find a man like this." And, "Why don't you marry him?" And I said, "You like him, you marry him." Anyhow, I didn't marry him and Avram, in Yiddish we actually called him Avrum because we spoke Yiddish, he received, found out that he has two sisters who live in America, who survived. I don't know where, I don't know too much about those things.</p><p>And they send him a visa. And I could have gone with him to America but I did not want to go.</p><p>Because I said, I'm not going to negate myself in any way. If I'm going to marry someone it's going to be somebody who I have deep feelings for. Love not only as a friend but as a . <span class="page-break" number="45"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 0 there and as soon as | look at him and he looks at me, he moves a little bit and makes room and says to me in Polish, "Please sit here." And I sit down next to him, and from the first moment, I care deeply about him. And I started to get worried, what about Binna? And he, I found out later that Avrum Schmol-lev-itz (ph) and this man, and I'll tell you later who he was, knew each other from the same hometown and the man that this man came with was also from the same hometown. From Bell-hot-off (ph), Poland. They're all survivors and they knew each other from home, they went from . And found out later that there were even some cousins also between these men.</p><p>And he, what I found later out, that he knew already that I am not going to get involved with him so he said to his friend, "If she cannot be for me at least let her be for you." Because he considered me to be okay, I don't know what he thought about me, but he wanted me to get a nice man. And the person that I met there was Rockmiel Zygmuntowicz (ph), my husband. And after, and he ask me can he take us home. So I said to him, "You came with your friend. Why don't you invite him too and we'll go together?" Because I wanted for Binna to have somebody, to make Y= you know how is, to be the matchmaker. And he said, "Okay." And they want to go upstairs and I said, "No, it's too late. After a certain hour nobody comes to our apartment." So he said, "Promise me that you're going to wait for me." He worked in shifts from morning until 2:00 and from 2:00 to 11:00. That I'm going to wait. He got a job and the other man was , which turned out later to be Binna's husband. And he said to</p><p> come, will we wait for him? And I agreed. Anyhow, I met him a couple of times and started to date Binna too. And one time, Rockmiel (ph) says to me, "Do you know a girl, her name is Manya Mo-nes-ka (ph)?" And I said, "By sight I don't know much about her. I just know she's a pretty girl. That's all I know about her, from sight. Why are you asking?" And he tells me that her brother was with him from where he came from, another city in Sweden, and he asked him to meet his sister. He wanted to make a match. He didn't tell me at the time though that he gave him a letter, he really was trying to make a match. So I said, "Why don't you go?" And Binna kicks me under the table, she said, "Are you crazy? You're going to send a cat for . You like him so much and you're going to send him to another girl?" I said. "Yes. If he likes her better, it's better he makes the choice now than later." And she didn't like that so she sent . He came back and he said, "Now we can get engaged." So a week <span class="page-break" number="46"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 1 the week of vacation, because we didn't have enough money for the next week. And on our honeymoon, we didn't go anyplace and we cooked a big pot of soup. And for a whole week, the four of us shared. This was our condition in the beginning. And yet, I've tried to make a go of it and Binna and I made a switch. I shared with her my apartment and Mandle (ph) and Rockmiel (ph) shared a little apartment when they came from the other city. So Binna went to live where Rockmiel (ph) lived with Mendle (ph) and Mendle (ph) moved in with me and Binna moved out, in that little apartment. You don't understand? I had an apartment where I shared with Binna before I was married. Mendle (ph) and Rockmiel (ph) came from another city and they had a little apartment. So when we got married, so Binna went to live with Mendle (ph), it was her husband.</p><p>And I lived with Rockmiel (ph). But there is something that, it's a curious thing, because I learn a lot from people. When an engagement we made, I didn't know too many people. So there was only Binna and Mendle (ph), Rockmeil (ph) and I, Avram, and two girls that I met in Boss (ph), that I didn't know from before. One girl tells, who was invited there, Rose Lift-ka (ph) she was called at that time, I don't know what's her, she was married, and she was very anxious to get married. She was a lot older and there wasn't any boys to marry, the girls were worried that they won't find, and not everybody wanted to marry out of their religion. So anyhow, we had a tiny room. All there was in the room is two single beds, a table and a couple of chairs. I didn't even have a stove in the room so we went to going from the steps, to go up to the first floor, I took a little, made a little curtain or drape and I bought a hot plate. And that's how I cooked. And from the sink that we used. But I was satisfied. So I went out to bring in the food. Anyhow, this girl says to me, I introduce my fiancee when we got engaged, and she says to me, "Yit-cola (ph), he's not for you." And I said, "Why?" And she said, "He's too big a flirt." And I think to myself, wait a minute, I only deal with facts. How would she know what he is, she just met him? She would say he's not attractive, she can see, but how can she know he's a flirt? He's never, she never met him before. So I just ignored.</p><p>After we were married, my husband asked me, "Are you good friends?" And I said, "Just met her." But I had no one else and I wanted somebody to be with us at our engagement. So he said, "Did you know that when you went out to , she invited me to come to her apartment without <span class="page-break" number="47"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 2 what she wants. I didn't argue, I didn't talk back. And it so happen that that's when I got pregnant, in that place. But I knew, as soon as it will be shown she will make me miserable. So again, I had to switch because I didn't want it to have, to worry, and somebody hear, so many of my people were murdered. And here, I had worried for so long, if I'll be able to bear a child. Here I'm pregnant and somebody looking down on me or not permitting me to have a child. I need her permission? So I started to look for an apartment to get, to keep the moving again. Anyhow, when, before, when I moved into another, when I was pregnant I moved to another apartment. And I didn't know anything about how the human body works. A woman's body. And the doctor just told me the date, when to expect. And just told me two things, that I'll have pains, bleeding, then it's time to come.</p><p>All the time my husband and I was rehearsing. Where we going to go? How we going to go?</p><p>Everything. It so happened he had still shift work. And he left in the morning and I woke up and my water bag broke but at that time I didn't know that I had a water bag and I didn't know what it was. I just saw it's not something that's, not, that I never had before. So I go in, I don't have a friend, I don't have a family, I don't have anyone that lives near that I can ask. So I go into a neighbor, to ask her, what does that mean? She said, "I don't know. Go ask the doctor." So she's advising me to go ask the doctor. My husband is not home, I don't have a telephone number. And here I see something is not right and I don't know what it is. So I take my bicycle and I'm going on a bicycle to ask the doctor. And here my water bag is broken. And I came to the doctor and they don't let me go home anymore. In the meantime, I'm showing you the different influences, how one thing influences the other. And in the meantime, my husband meets somebody in the street and they ask him, how is Yit-cola (ph), and he told them that I am expecting the baby. And here I was a little bit . Anyhow, and this was already after he knew that I went on the bike to the hospital, that the water bag broke. And he tells her the story. So she says, "Well, if the water bag broke and the baby's not born then the baby cannot live." In the meantime, I gave birth to a healthy boy and my husband comes to the hospital and he comes in, I see the uncertainty on his face. He holds his hands behind his back and not a smile, no emotion. I said, "What's going on here?" And I was wondering. No congratulations, no nothing. So distant and cold? I said, that's not my husband.</p><p>That's not the man I know. And I said to him, "Mistletov, we have a son." And he get so excited and tears are in his eyes, and behind he had a bouquet of flowers but he was afraid to show them because she told him the baby might not live, and he thought maybe it was a mistake. So I'm showing you, why am I telling you this story? I had no experience. I was alone. That when I needed somebody, a mother, I needed relatives to help me, I had nobody. You know? And my son was born October 12, 1948, the same year the State of Israel was born. Two miracles in my life. A son and after 2,000 years I lived to see the dream that my people prayed, the State of Israel. But unfortunately I didn't have relatives to share . And ever since I've been <span class="page-break" number="48"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 3 lose him so I went with him to the hospital. I come back to the work, and my boss saw, the first day she didn't say anything, and I wanted to stay, this is our little boy, he's . And she tells me, "Your personal life is of no concern of mine." I didn't say anything and I thought to myself, I'm free physically. Now I have to be independent financially too. And since my husband had shift and got my child with others, and I started to go to fashion design school. And I'll show you, I have the diploma. And I started to work. And when my second son was born, I no longer had to take him to the nursery. I could be home with him. Now, Binna and I, as I mentioned before, had a double wedding. She was, before I got pregnant she was pregnant and she miscarried. So she got pregnant again. I was early, she was, it turned out that we were, both she and I gave birth in the same hospital. Her first child was born on October 1, 1948. My son was born October 10, 1948. And since in Sweden, so many adjustments. In Europe, we didn't know about formulas. So we used to nurse each others children. We were very close with each other. Anyhow, then in November 29, 1951 my second son was born, . And as I said, I no longer needed to go to work outside but it was very, very difficult because I had, I sewed everything, from little suits for the children, to draperies, to slip covers, to custom and I worked very, very hard. But I was happy <span class="page-break" number="48"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 4 forego luxuries. I would never accept a handout from anyone. We worked hard work. And I will stay home with the children . And then in 1956, November 24, 1956, our son Samuel was born. Again, I remember that when I was going to go to America people said, where you going to go with a baby? Or the seas, and how are you going to make out? I always had faith. I said, listen, I'm nursing the baby. So at least until I nurse him he's not going to starve. And then somehow its going to work. You cannot have everything mapped out every inch of the way. And we went. It was difficult. I came here. I didn't know a single person in this country. I didn't know a single word of English. Again we had to adjust, to start anew, to make adjustment, to make work.</p><p> , | was already skilled, I was already a fashion designer but my husband had no marketable skills. He was working in a knitting factory making nylon stockings. But he was willing to work and take it, we went from one, it was very hard because he got a job here when we came to Philadelphia, he worked in . By the time he came, the the children were asleep. By the time he came home, they were already, they were still asleep, they were already asleep. And I said, no, this won't do. Because I will never put material possessions above spiritual things, which we need. So I encouraged him to change the job. There was an advertisement. After he worked a few days, they just had a few , they let him go. So he was taking any kind of job, three, four jobs. But he would never, we never took anything from anyone. And we struggled and then on February 21, 1964 our youngest son, Michael, was born.</p><p>And I knew that I made the right decision, to stay with the kids at home. Because, first of all, it would cost a fortune, four children you have to camp, and I didn't want to send them to camp because I remembered the beautiful summers that I had in the country, picking mushrooms and my mother showing, making crowns and put on your head, and singing, and I don't want them to miss all this here. I felt that to give them love, because I started to realize that it's the love that I received that I can give to others now. And that you can survive with very little because in Auschwitz I didn't have anything. And after I was married. Anyhow, when my youngest son was suppose to become barmitzvah, we decided instead for making a big party, his name was Michael, may be rest in peace, that we're going to go to Israel instead. And to celebrate his barmitzvah there. And since I'm an intuitive person, and we decided this already, I wake up one morning and I said to my husband, "Honey, let's go now." And he said, "When was this born? Why?" And I said, "I don't know why. I just now feel we should go now." And he agreed. And it was a very good decision.</p><p>And we went. And for the first time I met my cousin Uta (ph), okay? I was eight years old in 1934 when she left. I came there in 1974, with my youngest son. Ours was always a very close knit family and Uta (ph) was thrilled. We cried in each others arms. Because she was the sole survivor of her family. She always felt bad that she left. She never could come back. And I remembered my grandmother saying, . So I was able to go back with my son, to meet <span class="page-break" number="49"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 5 from it. And I remember that when we moved into our first home, this is my second home in America. He walked over to a neighbor's, his mother, an elderly lady. He said, "Lady, I don't have any grandparents. Would you be my grandmother?" I'm telling you those things, that it effected not only us, it effected the children. And she became like his adopted grandmother. She was very good to him. She lived to be 96. Anyhow, Michael and I, and I remember one time, you know he was more than fifteen years between him and my older son. So he almost grew up like an only child because they were already in college, . And one time I was sitting and I felt so lonely and I said, "Michael, I need a little medicine." And I'll never forget his scared look. And he said, "Ma, are you sick?" And I said, "Oh, not that kind of medicine. I need a hug and a kiss." And he came over and gave me a hug and a kiss and after that he would come over many times, he would say, "Want a little medicine?" And that became our between us, medicine meant a hug and a kiss. And when he was already in college, he would always, when I would write to him or call him, I'd say, "Michael, I can't wait to have a little medicine." And he said, "I can't wait to give it to you." And he was very successful because he was loved by many people. He was successful in college. He graduated from the University of Rochester. At age 25 he was already in a wonderful position and he owned his own home and he was successful in every way. He was dating a beautiful girl. And it was, my son Jerry was suppose to graduate in 1990, from University of Cornell. And Michael was here Thursday and he said, "Mom, Dad. Be ready. I'm going to come and pick you up. We're going to go to my brother's graduation." That was Thursday. Friday, the police came and told me that I have no longer a son. My son, Michael, was killed. And instead of a graduation party I had a funeral. He was killed instantly in an automobile. .. [end of side | of tape 5] Michael was loved. Hundreds and hundreds of people came to his funeral. Hundreds of trees were planted. He has a garden in Eastside from all the trees that was planted. My cousin,</p><p> , my son is gone, my family is gone.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When you came over here, to this country, was it easy for you to make new friends? And to start again? You had to begin again in Sweden.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: When I came here, as I said before without wanting to repeat myself, I didn't know one single person in Philadelphia. But when I was still in Sweden, when I came to Sweden, it was the same thing. And I'm going to go back something, to Sweden, because the same thing happened here. It happens to be related. When I was in Sweden, and one time it dawned on me, that if something would happen to me, you know? So alone and everything. Nobody would miss me. If I would die, nobody would, it wouldn't be a loss if people don't know me. And I decided that the most important thing is family and friends. And I made an effort to reach out. I was no longer of being hurt, that I lose somebody, because in life everyone that we love either they will die before us or we will die before them. But not to love is the greatest loss. Not to trust is the greatest loss. When I came here, I didn't know anyone. When I made my son's barmitzvah, the first one, I had over 100 people. And when I make my barmitzvah, I have over 300 people. When I was going to make Michael's barmitzvah, and I start to make the list, we needed 500 people. I don't say everybody was a personal, close friend, but they were people who I was involved. And I said, no, I cannot get involved. I made for my friends already now, I in Israel. I find one thing. That the survivors of the Holocaust here in Philadelphia, we have our, first we were called the Jewish New Americans. Then we changed the name to Holocaust Survivors. We have a common past and a common responsibility. To remember our personal stories. Because for us the Holocaust is both a personal and a collective Jewish tragedy. It's a human tragedy.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you find that, certainly as you were getting started here, that it was easier to be close to people who had also undergone the Holocaust? Or did you readily make friends with other people who hadn't been in Europe?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: First of all, I couldn't make friends with other people until I learned the language. And we formed already 1956, we already had here the organization. So we shared a lot together. And we realized that this cannot be just a social organization. We have to work for Israel. We have to remember the Holocaust and to share with others and to teach. But for me, I had and I still have, all kinds of people. If I would show you my telephone book, you will say how can you keep up?</p><p>Because I made, I didn't discriminate. I feel one thing, the only criteria that I, that is important to me, is not how much somebody has, who he knows, what he knows, but how much he cares. And when a person is caring, and he is a good, decent human being, than I can be their friend and they can be mine.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was difficult then, it's difficult still. However, I don't do only the things which are easy. I do many things which are difficult but they are necessary. And when I was asked, there was here a professor , the late , | mentioned to you before.

And I realized that there is not, we realized that there is very little in the text books about it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Actually what I'm trying to understand is, not so much in a formal way, speaking about it, but you had friends from all walks of life, talking in the earlier days here. Was this something that you could talk about? That you could share? Did people want to hear about it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I never went around and volunteered.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Just on a personal basis.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Okay, but I mean, what happened was that when people saw the number they start to ask me questions. And I answered. I always, I did the same thing like I did with my children when they asked about sex. Short question, short answer. They asked me so I answered. And people, not too many people were so interested, they didn't know what it is. And then, a little later, when people started to know about it, especially the Holocaust survivors, realized that in the text book there is very little about the Holocaust. They speak about World War One but not about the Holocaust. So we started to form an organization and be involved with this here. So it was difficult. Because, to give you one example, with some people it was easier. Some are more compassionate, some are more understanding and more curious. Others are more involved with their own life. So it depends who it was. I had my late friend told me that someone asked her once about the Holocaust and she started to tell a little bit. She said, "Well, we had that in America hard too. We didn't have any steak." And after that she decided never to talk about the Holocaust to her. The Holocaust has taught me many lessons. Because before the Holocaust I only had positive experiences. I had no frame of reference with which to compare all the blessings that I have. The blessing of a loving family. The blessing of good health. The blessing of having my home. Not to be called all different names. Because I've been called all kinds of names. I've been called no name at all. I've been called, derogatory now, Jewess, which was anti-Semitic name. I was called you refugee. You foreigner. All kinds of name. And I feel one thing, that its very important. Respect for one another. Respect for differences. That we cannot expect everybody to be alike. And that we must, I don't want to use the word must because that sounds dictatorial. It's important to protect our human rights. And just, in the very beginning, with even the smallest incident that's happened.</p><p>When somebody does not treat you right. I have learned to become a .

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: [have a question. Because you do feel responsible, a sense of responsibility for your world . . .</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Our world.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right, but it's the same. Are there certain events, historical events, in the last forty years or so that had a really strong impact on you other than, you've mentioned the birth of the Israeli State.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>Are there other things that have effected you in this country, like the Civil Rights Movement or wars or anything?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. I feel, do you remember there was a who came and he wanted to, here in Philadelphia, to speak in the movies about the Nazis? We went and marched. When there was, we went to speak. Then there was suppose to be a rally here, Nazis wanted to march here. We went to court, I was among them, and we fought against it. When I hear in private life, it doesn't only have to be in big things, in private life, when I was, when I hear that somebody is making a joke or on somebody else's expense, or an ethnic group, generalizations, I stand up and I speak up. I said, "I don't appreciate what you said." In fact, one of my dear friends who is non-Jewish, who I met through such occasion. Because we were in the , it was a meeting and somebody said something negative about another group. And I said, "I really don't appreciate because I know how it feels when people do that." So in small thing. You know, prejudice is very easy because you don't have to give accounts for it. You just say it but you don't have to give, you know? And the point is one thing, it's like fire. When there is only one spark, you can erase it. But if there is a big fire, you have no control any longer. So in the little thing and the inter-relationship, in our daily life, in the personal, how we do people. Because usually when a person from one group offends another, sometimes he starts hating or being angry towards the whole group. So its important to respect each other. It's important to speak up when there is a cause, when the Russian people worked, you know, when there was Iron Curtain, and we were fighting to release them, I was marching. So when there is something, a special cause, if I know, if I see something injustice I write a letter, I speak up. That's my contribution. Those are the things which I do. I cannot say, it doesn't bother because it effects. You know, I just wanted to add, the Holocaust effected not just me, because the point is one thing, six million Jewish people and about 5 million non-Jewish people have lost. They will never become what they had the potential of becoming. The world will never know how many wonderful people we have lost. Nor how many Nazi war criminals we have gained. Because some of them still live in hiding . So what did the world gain? <span class="page-break" number="53"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0 a criminal. What trade-off is that? So it's important.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you talk much about your experiences with your sons?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. But I spoke to them, I told them, but I spoke to them more about my experiences before the Holocaust. I wanted them to know their grandparents. Because I felt its important. And as a result, my oldest son , a couple of years, two or three years ago and maybe a little longer, came here to visit. He lives in New York. And afterwards he calls me up and he said, "Ma, I had a very traumatic experience." I said, "What's happened?" He said, "I was waiting for the train and I saw a man laying face down across the tracks. And I saw from nearby that the train is coming. I didn't know whether he was drunk, dead, sick, pushed, or wanted to commit suicide. I had no idea.</p><p>And I was thinking, what should I do? My mind was racing. On the one hand, I risk my life because I didn't know if I'm going to be able, get time to get back. And on the other hand, I thought, what would my grandmother do? My grandmother -" Because I told him the <span class="page-break" number="55"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 3 had to pull me up." My first reaction was, how could you do something like this? And then I said, " , when you graduated from Yale University I felt you achieved something special.</p><p>But this is something more special. You proved that you are a and that is the highest religion, education and achievement. I am very grateful." Another thing, because everything effects, another thing is that when he was little and he was the oldest and he was not born in this country, had also to learn the language and go through the difficulty as a child. I once told him, because he asked me also about my experience. I said, " , both your parents are survivors of the Holocaust. We lost everything that was ours. All that we have is our good name.</p><p>And if you will, I will always love you unconditionally, no matter what you will do because you are my child. But just like I ought to feed you, I ought to feed you spiritually. But there is one thing.</p><p>You do something morally and ethically wrong, you will not be allowed to have my name." And I completely dismissed it from my mind. When he was an adult already and I came to visit. And all of a sudden, he starts telling me, "You know, Mom? Whenever I was going to do something I asked myself, is this going to disgrace my parents?" And thank God, my son grew up to be a very respectable, loving son, husband, father. He has now a little girl, my grandchild, our grandchild.</p><p>She is named after my late son, second name. Her name is Elizabeth Michaela. We call her Eliza- la (ph). And she was here shortly before I went on the March of the Living, April 14, 1996. And for the first time, she noticed my number. And she looks at me, she says, she was here Mother's Day. During the time she learned a little more, she grew. And she's playing, busy playing, and she takes a look on my arm and she says, "Barbie, A-B-C's." Because she has a book with A-B-C's and she sensed that this is related. She's only two years old. So it's even effecting her. For me, for my children, even for my grandchildren, it's too late. They will never know the joy of having grandparents and Aunts and Uncle, they didn't know. But hopefully its not going to be too late for others. And I want to finish with a very inspiring story. Remember that I repeated many times that my grandmother's proverb, you only have what you give away. In 1984, I received a letter from a person that I didn't even know. Ida Jervis (ph), , Washington. And I opened the letter and I start reading it and it says, I'm your cousin. I'm named after the same great- erandmother, . I was four years old when my family left Poland and <span class="page-break" number="56"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 4 and parents, like they would be mine. And I still can give away. We can give knowledge, a poem, love, compassion. What you are doing, to give away typed, to record this here, it's the spiritual things that nobody can take away. And the result, passing them onto the next generations. The result is passing them onto any person, older, young, stranger or family. When we do that, then long after we are gone they remain. Because Anne Frank wrote a diary. She is gone and her diary is going to live on. And we can always give away kind words and good deeds. No matter how poor or rich we are. How educated or not. And this is what is important. This is the lesson of the Holocaust. Now you understand why I felt it's important to talk about my family. They gave me unconditional love. Showed me, my mother's experience and I, many times when I think, if she could love me so, so much a stranger, how much more did she love me? And that gives me, makes me feel like I'm worthwhile. And this is very important.</p></p></dialogue>
