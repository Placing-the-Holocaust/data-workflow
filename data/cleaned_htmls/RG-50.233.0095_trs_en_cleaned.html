There was a Social Democratic mayor at the time that Hitler came to power and he was Jewish. The story goes that the Berlin police was all poised. That when the Brownshirts were marching on Berlin in 1932, that the Berlin police and the Berlin National Guard was all mobilized with everything to give them the appropriate reception. But somebody cut the wire that led to a button underneath the mayor's desk, was sabotaged. When it came to pushing the button, nothing happened. Consequently Berlin was taken over by surprise.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We had boot camp in Leon, France which lasted five weeks. We went on to the Sahara Desert. I remember the crossing of the Mediterranean. The Mediterranean is a nice smooth body of water, very innocent looking but every once in a while, gets stormy. When it gets stormy, watch out. So we had one of those passages on a sloop, going to North Africa. The water was terrible, oh was it ever choppy. I couldn't remember a thing like that. It was stormy, outright stormy.

I saw people standing up, lining up on the railing, green in their faces and giving to the sea what's -- whatever they ate. Giving it back to the sea. I was down, sitting there, down at the captain's table and ate everything in sight. No, I had no fear of the sea at all.</p><p>So then we ended up in North Africa, we were ferried to -- we were transported in trucks, military convoys to the Sahara Desert. A little village tight at the outskirts of the desert, Bou Arfa. That remember. Wasn't far from the Algerian border with Morocco. But we were on the Moroccan side. We were told to -- regular little garrison, you know, garrison duty. We were told to watch out for the Arabs because they are very treacherous.

Never hit the target. I don't know. We had target practice and I always ended up hitting somebody else's target. I looked at the bayonet of the thing and it was dated 1792 or something like that.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, from Napoleon's time. That's what we had. Then we did our little garrison duty.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Made no difference, made no difference. We were all in the --. As a matter of fact, I remember when one of the colonels at the end of boot camp in Lyons, in the French mainland, gave us charge before dismissing us. He said, you are in the French Foreign Legion, you are here to die. To fight for your fatherland and to die. Little did he know that these are all a bunch of foreigners.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You stayed in the same barracks, the same location?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So that wasn't a problem, adjusting to that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was not a problem, no. The French government fed us and the Germans made us work. That's what. --- In other words, we still were, we were still obeying the French and the Germans were in the background.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It was German army units or Wehrmacht or --?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: A couple of higher-ups once in a while came to inspect the work we were doing and sniff around a little. But largely they left us alone because we were doing our job.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The first time, the first thing I notices we were stripped of all clothing, all belongings. Next thing I got a number tattooed.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Then we were told to go into the sauna.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What -- do you have any experiences that you want to talk about there in particular?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, some representative of the Siemens Works came and they were both recruiting officers, civilians by the name of --. One was Hanke, H-a-n-k-e, and the other was Jungdorff, J-u-n-g-d-o-r-f-f. They were representatives of the Siemens Works. They were looking for mechanics. They asked me to do certain things to explain to read the scales on calipers and to identify mechanic's tools and things like that and they were satisfied. They were hiring me on the spot.</p><p>From that moment on, I was treated fairly well.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you leave camp?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We left the camp and we were transferred to a little -- used to be a tile factory, a brick factory. A brick factory which was abandoned of course, near the Elbe River, which was taken over by the Siemens people. They were giving us lathes and drilling presses and all these tools to make jigs for using electrical components, like switch components, contacts and things like that. So we had the tools. I don't know where they got them from but we had the tools. They were pretty good too, they were pretty good quality.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you live --?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We had, yes. We had bunk beds with mattresses and bedding. We had horsehair covers and pillows. Strangely enough, we had -- was --. That's why Isay. You see, I don't open my mouth too wide because I don't have the experience that others had.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You had enough!</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I had enough? Compared to what others experienced, I was pretty well treated.</p><p>We had good food --.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You had enough?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We had sausage, we had cheeses, we had -- you name it. I was pretty well nourished, couldn't complain.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You spent the duration of the war there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Potato soup and so on and so forth.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: deg45,.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: deg45. We had to leave. We had to leave in a hurry, had to abandon everything and we went to Dachau. [See NOTE at end of transcript]</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did you get there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We were transported again in wagons, in cattle wagons but there was one difference. We could take our belongings and our foods along. The trip took only about a day. We spent about, I would say, five days in Dachau before the two recruiting officers from Siemens found us again. We were again singled out.</p><p>This time we were transported by truck, military convoy to Berlin; Siemens, their main factory there. That's where we continues doing our little thing. Except that every time the Allies laid down one of those bomb carpet, we had to go into the bunkers, into the shelters. This was in Arbeitslager. This was not a concentration camp, this was a work camp. At that time we had to go hurriedly back to the work camp and go into the bunker because Siemens had in itself, only bunkers enough for their own employees. So we had to go back. We had to share these bunkers with the SS. But again, they left us alone. They were humans, human beings. They left us alone. There was one bunker next to ours; there was only SS. We didn't - they didn't --. One of those bombs really hit hard. I was standing near the door and I felt the impact from the air rushing in, you know, the pressure, the sudden air pressure. The bunker next to us got a direct hit and when they dug these -- got all these bodies out, one guy had a gun, the thing was turned around and looked like a trumpet, one of those French horns. That was the impact.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was that he most terrifying thing that you experienced, the bombing?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, it stood out in my mind. We had to -- there were lots of incendiary bombs they dropped and they never exploded. You know these pencils, they were octagonal in shape and they had a pin, you know. The idea was when these things dropped down, the pin got pushed in and the flame threw out. They had us pick up those things that did not go off and just hold them away from us; push the pin and let them flame out.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, so they were little, they were small bombs?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They were the incendiary bombs. The incendiary bombs; they look like gigantic pencils with a pin at the end.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: They made you do that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They made us do that to neutralize those things, to get all the stuff out. Now actually, when the flame gets thrown out, these things don't get hot. The flame is far enough away from these pencils --.</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So on one got killed doing that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No one got killed doing that. We went into a neutral area. As a matter of fact, they had a whole sack full of potatoes for us. For what was in the kitchen, raw potatoes. We amused ourselves to discharge these things against the potatoes. So we had some nice roasted potatoes for dinner. No, we didn't -- I personally didn't suffer too much. The skills --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Where were you liberated?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, then Berlin got too hot. The Siemens complex was destroyed. Our work camp was destroyed and they ferried us up to Oranienburg concentration camp, back to the concentration camp. That was already the later days of the Nazi era.</p><p>Most people saw the light; that this was an untenable situation and the Germans were done for. Was only a matter of time. They prepared us -- again no hardships. They prepared us for a march to Meklenburg, to the Meklenburg region and we were supposed to board a Red Cross ship in Bremen but we had to walk over there. The order came to march us into a forest and to machine-gun us all to death.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You knew that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, yes, the SS told us. We got the orders to shoot you all. But we refused to do that. We don't want to do that. Orders, nobody checks on these orders as the war is over. The war is finished.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So this was April, probably?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: This was April of "45, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: They were afraid at that point of retaliation?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They were afraid it was that point retaliation. They said to hell with these orders.</p><p>We just march on. Let's go. So we go. We went to that one forested area, full of foxholes, for the night. Bedded ourselves down in one of the foxholes. We had our -- at that time our hair was starting to grow and we had our -- we took our blankets along and all that. We were pretty well organized there. In the morning, we looked around, no SS. No German officers. There was a clearing. In a far clearing, I saw a rider, man on horseback. Turned out to be a Russian soldier on reconnaissance. They discovered us and took us in to a gigantic farmhouse with a barnyard and what-not. The Russian colonel who turned out to be a medical doctor, spoke a good German at that time, he said, look, you're free. But if you want to do yourself a favor, don't eat right away anything that comes into sight. I know you are hungry. We will give you some thin soup and we'll gradually increase your diet to where your stomachs can digest it, because if you eat, you die. That's what the colonel said.
