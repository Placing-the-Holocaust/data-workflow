<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did she like living there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yeah. The only thing she missed was her parents and her brothers and sisters. She had a large family, but she adapted, you know, quite well, and she had a very good life till things started going badly.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So talk to us a little bit about that life. What was your father's business? What did he do?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Going to the park with my mother. My father would go to the cafes every day after he did his business, whatever.

And then poetic justice, my granddaughters did that to me when they were little. So my memories of my very early childhood were very good, except that I developed polio when I was about five years old, and I had to spend quite a lot of time in the hospital in Fiume. It was during the polio epidemic, but --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, I remember that, the treatments, and being separated from my parents.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, you were a little girl, yeah, yeah. When you were little, did you hear anything about politics? I mean you were a child, but --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, everyone was, you know, sort of enamored with Mussolini; you know, I mean all the children wore their uniforms and marched, and I mean as a child, I didn't sense anything going wrong, but my parents, of course, must have kept a lot from us.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you already start school in the "30s?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I never went to school. I never went to elementary school.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. -- So tell me a little bit about the larger political context for Italy and the town, then how it affected your town, and then how it affected your lives. What was going on in the late "30s?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, my father couldn't work anymore.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Why?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because of the sanctions that Germany imposed, and then Mussolini followed.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay. <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> Interview with Eugenia Was WIEBE oma Stour colseten 9</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: So Jews were not allowed to work.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And this was from "38?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think it started in "38, and we weren't allowed to go to school. There were a lot of limitations imposed on us, but nothing threatening physically. It was all economical; a lot of squeezes on my parents. Now, we lived in this house called Villa Jaime, and my mother used to go to a park, as I told you, all the time that had orchestras and famous people coming, and so she would meet people from Austria, and so she connected with someone that wanted to get out of Vienna, and they lived with us for a whole year.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember them?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, the name is Hellreich. As a matter of fact, he's a dermatologist in Manhattan now, and my parents remained good friends with them throughout their lives, and so that supplemented and helped pay for the rent. My mother had to give up, you know, some rooms for them, and somehow she sold possessions that she had, and somehow we got by. We even went back to Poland. My mother took my brother and I to Vienna and Presburg because she had family there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Presburg, Bratislava, you mean?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Maybe that was in "37. I'm not so sure when. It must have been before the sanctions.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So do you have vague memories of having been on this trip?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Very vague, though.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Does anything stand out? <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> Interview with Eugenia Was WIEBE oma Stour colseten 10</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Iremember the houses. Apparently, my father's father was the richest man in town.</p><p>He owned the bank. He owned the grocery store. He owned the only brick house in the town, and, you know, and some of it was also like supplied by my mother who, you know, said that everybody was so glad to see us, and so that was the last time my mother saw her parents and sisters and brothers.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What happened to them?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They were all killed. Every one of them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did she ever find out how and what the details were?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, she found out that they all had to dig their own graves, and they were shot. And my mother always felt so guilty because she had a single sister, Esther, and she wanted to come to Italy so badly, but because my grandparents were heartbroken when my mother left, she didn't want to do it to them again, so she did not encourage her coming because she always said if she had only brought her to Italy, she would have been alive maybe.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That must have weighed heavily.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And one brother ended up in Auschwitz, and he lived till the very end, and then he -- I think some kind of accident in the camp killed him.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell me a little bit about the Hellreich family. What -- they came from Vienna?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: From Vienna.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And why?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They were waiting for their visa. They had family here. He had brothers who were willing to sponsor him.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: "Here" meaning the United States? <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> Interview with Eugenia Was WIEBE oma Stour colseten 11</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The United States. And they just got out, and, you know, they lived with us for a year, so they must have gone just before the war. Their visa came through.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And how many people were there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Four.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Freddy, Alfred Hellreich.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Alfred Hellreich. Did they tell you stories, your family stories of what was going on in Vienna?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, they must have told my parents. I was a very young child, so these things did not penetrate. I just knew subliminally, you know, that things were not going so well.</p><p>And we didn't have that much cash. I remember taking a walk with my father, where before he would like lavish on us, and we wanted a banana, which was quite exotic back then,and he took the last of whatever he had, and he bought it for us, and my brother and <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> Interview with Eugenia Was WIEBE oma Stour colseten 12 I shared it, so I knew that, you know -- and we had, after the Hellreichs left, we had to move because we couldn't afford that big house anymore.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you own the house, or were you renting it?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. I mean my poor parents, I mean they were beside themselves.

He was in Hungary. He was in Austria.</p><p>Then he ended up in France, and he ended up in Italy, so he really --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: He saw the world?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, he moved around.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did things develop further as time went on, and how did it affect your family?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, we lived like that till 1940, when Germany declared war, and Mussolini went along with Hitler.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And so one night we were all sleeping, the carabinieris came, and they just took my father away, and I remember, you know, standing at the window screaming, "Papa, Papa," and they took him to a prison in Fiume where they kept him for a while, and we didn't know what was going to happen. They didn't take my mother and my brother. And <span class="page-break" number="11"></span> Interview with Eugenia Was WIEBE oma Stour colseten 15 then eventually they sent him to a concentration camp in Fiera Monte. Have you heard of it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It's in Calabria. It was one of the camps that they had in Italy for Jews and other political prisoners, whatever, and then a few days later, they moved us, also, and they sent us to a very small town near Rome called Atessa.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Atessa?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It has all kinds of ruins. It's historically very old with walls around the town, you know, and they called that internment. We were interned.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What did it look like? What kind of places did they put you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was a very small little village. We were not allowed to go to school. We were not allowed to leave town. We had to be in after "Ave Maria," you know, when the bells ring in the evening. We had to report to the police station with our number to make sure that we didn't escape. We weren't allowed to associate with the community, but Italians, they didn't pay any attention, and we as kids had a lot of friends.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were there more Jews who were brought to this place?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: There were other Jews and some people who maybe were alleged to be Communists or politically undesirable, and but Mussolini paid us a stipend, and so we were able to exist, and he did not go along with Hitler's extermination plan, you know. I mean he said that he would take care of the Jews in Italy.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Do you think he did? <span class="page-break" number="12"></span> Interview with Eugenia Was WIEBE oma Stour colseten 16</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes, he did in his way by isolating us. And then my mother wrote a letter petitioning, you know, that we wanted to be reunited with my dad, and about a year later, he came to Atessa.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. So he was in prison for how long; about a year and a half, two years?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: About a year, I would say. But it wasn't a torture camp. It wasn't an extermination camp. It was more a containment camp.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was it labor? Was it forced labor there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: He just had to stay there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He just had to -- you know, they had no liberties to leave, but they weren't harmed.</p><p>And so then my father joined us.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What did he look like? Had he changed in his manner?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My dad, no, because he wasn't harmed in any way, except all his rights were taken away from him.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And then we lived in this town, Tuscania, for several years.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Hang on a second. Before we come to that, you mentioned that all his rights were taken away. Did you feel that? You were a child at the time, but did you feel what that meant?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I knew that I couldn't go to school like other children did.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay. <span class="page-break" number="13"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Interview with Eugenia Weiss Greenberg infomation abouts cotseten 17</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And my parents made every effort to get us tutors, you know, because there was some English people that were also interned because they got caught up being in Italy, and so, you know, my parents made every sacrifice to, you know, have us become literate, and which we did, but we never went to any formal school. And also they had to sacrifice and sell things in order to, you know, pay for tutors and our education.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So his business was simply confiscated way back in Abbazia?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, he was just stopped from operating it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So it closed down?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, he was prohibited. Jews were prohibited to, you know, to work, period.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: By this point you're eight or nine years old when you were in this village; is that so?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. Yeah. "32-- yeah. I was eight.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you able to understand more of what was going on around you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I knew that we had limitations and that we weren't from that place, and, you know, you become very smart very quickly when you are under stress and your parents are being displaced, and but we made the best of it, you know. We kind of got by.</p><p>And then they sent us, because we were so dangerous, they sent us to another town after about two years, I think.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was the official reason?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, they never gave it to us, you know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see. Do they just come and announce it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: They just said, you know, you have to now go to the Abbruzzi, which is like a mountainous region of Italy, and we went to a town called Atessa. <span class="page-break" number="14"></span> Interview with Eugenia Was WIEBE oma Stour colseten 18</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And what was that like?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, you know, we found nice lodgings in this tiny little villa out of the way, small little rooms. I remember that. It had a garden outside. We started planting things. And somehow, you know, we managed. But then in 1943, when Mussolini was executed -- I don't know if you know that story.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I thought he was executed at the end of the war.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was in "43, the end of "43.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. So when he was executed?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, when he was killed and hung upside down over that bridge in Torino, then the German -- the Italian government became an ally of the Allied Forces.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Of the Allied Forces?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, the Italians, and so then the Germans felt free to invade Italy, and that's when things really became bad for us.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What happened?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, then we had to hide and run because they were hunting Jews, and even though the Italians, you know, were very good, they didn't turn you in because there was very little anti-Semitism in Italy. There weren't that many Jews to hate. And so then things <span class="page-break" number="15"></span> Interview with Eugenia Was WIEBE oma Stour colseten 19 became, you know, quite hectic for us. We had to run and hide, and then the bombing started, so we had to protect ourselves from that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did you -- excuse me. How did you hide? Would you leave?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We would run, you know, when we would hear, somebody would tell us that the Germans were looking, we would run into the countryside and look for farmers, and I think some of them my parents must have bribed, you know, and they let us sleep in their stalls and whatever.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And then you would return back to --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Then when we heard that they left, and once they caught us, the Germans.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What happened? Tell me in detail.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, we were very lucky that he was a humane German S:S. lieutenant, whatever.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell me the circumstances of how you were caught.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, we were running, and, you know, they had dogs, and they had guns, and they caught us. And my brother and I, we started crying, you know, "Please don't take my daddy," and "please," you know, we cried, and somehow, you know -- oh, there was a German woman also interned because she was married to a Jew from Hamburg.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So they caught you and they took you to --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We were running, you know, with this other couple. They were staying in a neighboring farm, and so she started speaking to the -- she was a glamorous-looking blonde -- to this captain, lieutenant, whatever he was, and somehow by a miracle of miracles, they let us go back, you know, to hiding, whatever.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In other words, they never brought you to a prison? You were caught on the road? <span class="page-break" number="16"></span> Interview with Eugenia Was WIEBE oma Stour colseten 20</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, we were caught running in a countryside.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And the funny thing is that my mother tells me that he told us we can go back home.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And that the next day, he came with some provisions.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. So I guess there were some humane, you know, Germans, also.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was he alone when you were caught, or were there lots of soldiers?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, he had a lot of soldiers, but he was in command, so, you know, I don't know what he told them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Because that's unusual. That would sound unusual.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [know. We always talk about how lucky we were that --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And she said something in German to him, do you think?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, my parents spoke German, too, you know, so they spoke to him, and he had pity on us, and he just let us all go.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Wow.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But frightening for children.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh, I never forgot that, how it was, you know, muddy, and how we lost our shoes running, and also the Germans had set mines all over the place, so it was very dangerous where you were going because one day while we were running, one of the people running in back of us just got killed from a mine. <span class="page-break" number="17"></span> Interview with Eugenia WER abournns coteeton 21</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Stepped on it and blown to bits?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Also very terrifying for a child; I mean terrifying for anybody.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: For anybody.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Anybody, but a child at age ten, eleven, and your brother even younger; do you think that that affected you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, you know, always people tell me that I'm emotionally, you know, a strong person. It kind of hardens you in a way. In a way, we were like wise beyond our years because my parents would tell us to go and listen to what some of the Germans were saying, you know, because --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You could speak German?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because we understood what they were saying, so I know we did that when we were quite young.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were there Germans in those villages before Mussolini died?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So Germans only appeared in your lives --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Appeared after, after.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: His murder?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He didn't let them interfere.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I mean one thing about him, he didn't let the Jews be sent to concentration camps, and he protected his Jews as long as he was alive. I mean even though we lost all our <span class="page-break" number="18"></span> Interview with Eugenia Was WIEBE oma Stour colseten 22 freedoms and everything, but that was a compromise, I guess, that we had to live by and in a way be grateful because we are here, and, you know, we did survive, and then there was a whole conflict in that area.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hmm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Because the Germans were there, and the Allies were coming in, and there was like --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So there were battles?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, terrible battles. We saw people getting killed right out near, looking out the window. There was actual war right where we were.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But give me the name again.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Atessa.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Atessa. And again, war comes upon you, and you're children?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. Well, they mined everything. They destroyed all the bridges, you know, so that the Allies couldn't come in easily. And at this point I developed a very high fever, temperature, while we were running. And we were staying in this farm house, so they had a hospital there, so my parents took me to the hospital, and they let us stay in the hospital, and they had cannons on top of the hospital, even though they had a big Red Cross on top of it, and we could hear the bombs coming and going, you know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So this was the Italians who had those cannons, or whose cannons?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, the Germans.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you were in a hospital where there were German cannons?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Underneath. And, you know, they gave us shelter, and at that point they weren't looking for us because they were just fighting and retreating. <span class="page-break" number="19"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Interview with Eugenia Weiss Greenberg infomation abouts cotseten 23</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So my question is this. Two questions. Did you ever feel under -- insecure around Italians that you might be betrayed?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no, never. They were very brave, or maybe they didn't understand the consequences of their deeds. I don't know which it was. But wherever we went, somebody, you know, would give us succor, you know, would give us protection.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And did you look -- I mean, again, would it be easy to recognize you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, because, you know, we were running, and my parents negotiated, and we just hid in this stall. Every now and then they were kind enough and invite us to a meal, but, you know, most of the time, we just subsisted on whatever we could find. So, you know, my brother and I said, you know, maybe if we knew who they were, we might go looking for them, you know, but it was so transient because we didn't stay in any place for that long because it was dangerous.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you limited by a certain area, though, I mean that you moved from place to place, but never very far from where you were before?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, we stayed in the countryside because we thought we were safer there, and also maybe safer from the bombing and from all the --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Where were some of the larger towns so that I'd get a geographical sense?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Atessa. I really don't know, you know. It's in the Abbruzzi.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And while you were in the hospital, and there were the cannons up top, what happened? Did they fire from there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: They fired from right up our roofs, and they would fire back, and that whole part of that hospital was demolished. <span class="page-break" number="20"></span> Interview with Eugenia Was WIEBE oma Stour colseten 24</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So it was not safe at all?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It wasn't safe. So then we ran. Someone told us to run to this hotel in town, and practically the whole building fell on us, but, you know, we went to a basement, whatever, and, you know, we survived.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You hid in the basement?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We were just lucky.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How long did this go on for?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Seemed like forever, but I guess it wasn't that long, but then, you know, the Allies came in, and they liberated us.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember what they looked like when you saw them?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They were British. They were British troops that liberated that part of Italy, mostly Indians.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. The Indians, you know, fought for the British, and they found us a place to stay, an apartment that, you know, if it was empty, they just took it temporarily, and one of the Indian officers lived with us, and then all of a sudden things started looking up because we had food, and we had protection, and we --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And this was 1944?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The end of "44.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. So --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And then in -- and then we went -- we stayed there for a few months, and then we were sent to a DP camp. <span class="page-break" number="21"></span> Interview with Eugenia Was WIEBE oma Stour colseten 25</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And where was the DP camp?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The first one was Palazze, which is near Naples, but they were old Army barracks.</p><p>They were not equipped for winter living. So it was really pretty there because it was near the Mediterranean, and we had a very nice summer, and then when fall came, they sent us to Barletta.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Where is that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, well, first when we were liberated -- I'm sorry -- we went to Palazze. Then they sent us to Santa Maria de Bagno, it was called, in the Apulia section. And then they had confiscated all these villas of rich Italians who were, you know, using them for the summer, and they put all the displaced people in these villas.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were there many displaced people?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yeah. Then all the people started coming from Poland, from Auschwitz, and that's when I learned Yiddish.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So is that also when you learned, your parents learned, at least, what had happened in Poland?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, they had heard rumors.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: While the war was still going on.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: That must have been so heartbreaking. <span class="page-break" number="22"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Interview with Eugenia Weiss Greenberg infomation abouts cotseten 26</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Somebody came to our house one day, I remember that, and told my mother, and then she was hysterical, crying, and somehow, you know, we found out what it was all about, that she was told that her whole family was, you know, was killed.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Which house would this have been?

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Was murdered.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So that would have been when you were in one of the villages?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You were in Tuscania.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A:So rumors, you know, traveled. People got mail or whatever. I don't know how this man found out. And as a matter of fact, when my sisters were born after the war, and then in the Jewish religion, you are not allowed to name after the living, so my parents named -- they gave them both Biblical names because they weren't absolutely sure who had survived and who didn't because this was all hearsay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, tell me this, something I meant to ask and forgot momentarily. Were your parents very religious?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, they were -- came from a very religious background, but when we lived in Italy, my dad tried to maintain all the Jewish traditions, you know, Passover, and mainly I remember Passover, where he made his own matzo because we couldn't get that, but there was no such thing as having kosher food or, you know, anything like that, but we <span class="page-break" number="23"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Interview with Eugenia Weiss Greenberg infomation abouts cotseten 27 maintained, you know, at home. So then we were in the DP camps, several different DP camps. Let me see. One, two -- about four of them for five years.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Why?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, because you needed -- you know, to have a visa to come here.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you didn't want to stay in Italy, your parents?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, we couldn't go back to Abbazia because it wasn't Italy anymore. It was Communist Tito.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And your father didn't --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And we didn't want to go back to more oppressions, and we didn't know -- things were not the same.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So my parents debated whether to go to Israel or -- and then he opted, he said, you know, after what we went through, he wanted us to come to a safe place.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: So we waited.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you were in these various DP camps for five years?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you go to school?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, after the war.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We took -- my parents hired again tutors to prepare us to pass an entrance exam, because in Italy, you know, you have to pass entrance exams, each level of schooling that <span class="page-break" number="24"></span> Interview with Eugenia Was WIEBE oma Stour colseten 28 you go through, and we made it, and then we started middle school, and then from then on we went to Genoseo {ph}, and then {undecipherable} for one year, so I had -- which is like almost a year of college.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When you were in the DP camps, did it feel like internment, or did it feel like just temporary housing?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, temporary housing, in barracks. We had one room for six people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Who was there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Communal. My two sisters.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, they were born.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My brother and my parents. And we had communal showers and bathrooms, and very primitive. They had mess hall, you know, for people. We were fed that way. And the school was very far away, so in one town, my father hired a man with a donkey, and he would pick us up every morning and take us to school --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: A chauffeur.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- you know, and then pick us up because he started working, and they had like a K.P.</p><p>thing in the camp itself, and he was running it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, that's what my next question is. How did your father earn any money that he would be able to --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, they gave us, you know, provisions, cans of food, and we had lodging, and then when he started, you know, working in this K.P., he started earning some money, and they, my parents, sacrificed a lot for our education, hiring math professors, because, you <span class="page-break" number="25"></span> Interview with Eugenia Was WIEBE oma Stour colseten 29 know, we really didn't know anything about math, and but somehow we did well even without --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Formal schooling?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- without having any elementary education.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's pretty amazing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's pretty amazing. Were they -- had their personalities been affected?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My parents?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, by everything that they had gone through.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, my dad was, you know, quite nervous. I'm sure it affected them deeply, but they didn't really -- you know, my father was a very positive-thinking man. He was always grateful, you know, that we survived and that we were healthy and that, you know, things, when we came here, even though they struggled, you know, my dad could never earn much money, and he had to go and learn how to be an operator.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What kind?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Clothing, you know, sewing, because he couldn't find -- he didn't speak the language.</p><p>He spoke a little English.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So was he a tailor here?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not a real tailor. I think they did piecework, whatever.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's tough.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was very tough for them, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did both of them do this? <span class="page-break" number="26"></span> Interview with Eugenia Was WIEBE oma Stour colseten 30</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, then my mother, because she had twolittle children --</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Of course.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- and so she couldn't really go to work. And then we came here to join finally an uncle in Hoboken. My father promised him that he would never ask him for anything if he --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Sponsored you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- if he brought us over here, and we never did. And we came in 1950 to the United States. And we stayed for seven weeks in a hotel. The Joint {ph} put us up there, and then we went to the {undecipherable}, which is where the</p><p> Shakespeare Theater is now.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I don't know where that is in New York.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It's on Broadway.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In the village.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And then they found us an apartment in the Bronx, a five-floor walk-up.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And how big was it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It had enough rooms, but the Bronx was turning, and it wasn't such a safe place anymore. So my parents sent my sisters to a Yeshiva, a Hebrew school, and my brother and I, he was 16 and I was 18, so we went to work, and so we managed.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's tough.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah, it was very tough. <span class="page-break" number="27"></span> Interview with Eugenia Was WIEBE oma Stour colseten 31</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: All that displacement.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: All that displacement. So actually you kind of lost home?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Many times.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Many times. Did you ever have a feeling of home?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, home was where my parents were, you know, and we had a very strong family bond. So because of my parents, somehow, you know, knowing that we were together and we were with them, that gave you a sense of safety, but we were always, you know -- everything was unpredictable. We never knew what would be tomorrow.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But the one thing that was stable was the family?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Was the family.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's pretty big.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, family is very important.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did your life progress here in the states?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I married in 1952.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So pretty soon?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And first I went to work in a factory. Then I progressed to a clerical job. And then when my daughter was born quite soon after, and so I had three children. <span class="page-break" number="28"></span> Interview with Eugenia Was WIEBE oma Stour colseten 32</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And I stayed home.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When were your children born?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, Debbie was born in "53, and then a son was born in "57.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What's his name?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Steven. And he died two years ago, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: My condolences.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And I have another son, Richard, who is going to be 50. He's not 50 yet.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So he was born in the "60s?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. And as soon as they were a little older, I went to college.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, what college did you go to?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Brooklyn College.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And I did well in school, and then I got a master's in school psychology.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I wanted to ask you about that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, and I worked for 27 years as a school psychologist, and I am now retired.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, tell me, why did -- how -- or how was psychology something that drew you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, I don't know. When I graduated college, I started teaching, and I thought that that's what I really wanted to do, to teach, but New York City at that time, you know, it was not ideal to teach, especially not middle school. I made a mistake. If I had gone into elementary school, probably it would have been better for me because in my nature, it wasn't in me to be a police person. <span class="page-break" number="29"></span> Interview with Eugenia Was WIEBE oma Stour colseten 33</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And middle school you kind of have to?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Thirty percent of the time having to discipline kids.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So I realized very quickly that that wasn't what I wanted to be, and so I said I'll try and find something within the school system that gets me out of the classroom, and so -- and I made the right choice because that was, you know, the right decision for me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did psychology intrigue you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't know if it was so much that I was intrigued. I just knew that it would be a good job for me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because I like people, and I'm very, you know, sympathetic to other people's plights, so and it worked out well.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What is it that your parents -- in the things that we inherit, we can inherit things, but we can also inherit things that are not tangible. What are the intangibles that your parents kind of bequeathed to you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My parents, you know, I have four siblings, and we all, despite everything that we went through, we all turned out to be resilient, and humanitarian, and upstanding citizens with very good moral values, you know, so whatever my parents did, they did something that just worked, you know, and we all turned out to be pretty successful in our own pursuits. Everyone in my family is a professional, you know, and so my parents made the right choice coming to this country.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Tell me how their lives progressed after they came here. <span class="page-break" number="30"></span> Interview with Eugenia Was WIEBE oma Stour colseten 34</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, when the Bronx turned so badly, my brother helped them buy a house in Brighton.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He put down the down payment, whatever.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Brighton Beach?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. Brighton, First Street. It was a two-family house because they had two, you know, they had two young children, and they didn't want to have to deal with the changes that were happening, and they were very happy with this little house. You know, they rented the upstairs, and even though my father didn't make very much, but with the rent, and they lived frugally, and they didn't have any excesses, you know, they somehow managed to have a very nice life here.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were they happy people?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, my dad was a very happy person. He was very gregarious. He liked to tell jokes. He loved people. He became very religious, though, and he went to a synagogue regularly. And he died in 1978.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And your mom?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My mom died in 1986. She was 93.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Wow.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did they ever talk to your children about--</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, not really. My kids interviewed her, you know, for school, different things like that, but nothing, nothing formal. <span class="page-break" number="31"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Interview with Eugenia Weiss Greenberg. 35</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And did you, amongst yourselves, the -- all the children and your parents, without your children involved, did you talk about these things?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, my brother and I did, and especially we went back together a few years ago, ten years ago. We spent a month in Florence. We had an apartment, and we rented a car, and we went back to both Tuscania and Atessa. And it's really strange, you know, that what you remember and what is is not always the same.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So how did that show up?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: We went there. We found the places that we lived in. We remembered it, you know, between the two of us, we located the places, and, you know, where I had remembered a huge park, it was a tiny little nothing. -- The villa that we lived in in Atessa, you know, was --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Not so big?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, it wasn't big. I don't remember it being big, but we scouted around, and we went to places that we remembered. So that was very nice. Now no one knew, remembered anything.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Okay. Do you think there were any -- it's so transient, so it's almost like in the areas where you were during those years, there were probably no footprints left of what happened, or are there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, I'm sure that some people do know, but maybe, you know, because we were just there for two days, we couldn't really do any investigative reporting, you know, and see, but we went by where we had to go and give our number every day, and we went to, you know, different sites that we remember, so we did do that. <span class="page-break" number="32"></span> Interview with Eugenia Was WIEBE oma sbourans eoteewen 36</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I remember we were looking at a photograph of maybe it was the same trip or another trip when you were there with your daughter?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no, that was -- you know, that's the -- that's a different part of Italy.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's where you were originally from, right?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Where your daughter and --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, that's Apulia {ph}. That's not --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you ever go back to Abbazia?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, I went back a few years ago, and that was also a big, you know, blow to my memory, but I did find Villa Jaime where I was born, and I did find the park, and the places we went swimming, and Principe Umberto, which I remember as being this huge hotel was broken up into different parts. But the general atmosphere, the palm trees, and the beauty of the little place, you know, remains.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Doesn't mean your memory was wrong; it just means life changed?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, it just was distorted, and even though it's Croatia, you know, people still speak Italian there. Many stores still have Italian headings, and so the -- you know, the Croatian government now is making it -- you know, is resuscitating the allure of the place.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did your grandchildren express interest in what had gone on with you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not that much really. You know, they ask questions every now and then, but they never, you know, never explored. But my brother has some tapes, but, you know, he is not here anymore, and he lives in Pennsylvania. <span class="page-break" number="33"></span> Interview with Eugenia Was WIEBE oma Stour colseten 37</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: He lived in Pennsylvania?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He interviewed my mom before she died.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, I think. I don't know if-- what happened to the tapes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Because those could be very interesting to have at the museum.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, I don't know. I'll have to ask my sister-in-law if she has them, or if she knows where they are.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That could be quite -- that would be very, very important, you know. We would value that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't know what, you know, the interview is all about, but when I speak to her next, I will ask her if she remembers.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And for yourself, those formative years, when -- when you had such an insecure life and sometimes a life that could have been easily taken away, how do you think that that's -- what does it play -- when you think of your life in total, how big is that portion of it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, it's at the core of me, you know. I think it made me who I am. It made me strong and flexible, and it's something I'll never forget. It's a history that, you know, that will be with me forever, even though it's kind of not always there, you know, on the outside.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I think your daughter mentioned to me when she got in touch with us that you had never given your story before. You had never told -- <span class="page-break" number="34"></span> Interview with Eugenia Was WIEBE oma Stour colseten 38</p></p></dialogue>
