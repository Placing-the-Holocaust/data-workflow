<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was your family a very religious family?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. My father was not very religious but we attend services in the next small town because the town where I was born and where we lived later, it was composed only of two other Jewish family.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So both towns were not primarily Jewish.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, they were not.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I see. Did you live -- what was the next town that you were --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: (sounds like Parcheetza). <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Henry Kolber 5 where I was born.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you had said that there were also only two other families that were Jewish in the town.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That is correct.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh. And did you grow up right in the center of the town?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. I grew up in the center of the town and when -- and I attended public school there. And at age of 11 or ten, my father hired a tutor who taught us the -- prepared for the bar mitzvah, me and my brother. And we had this man -- or different men living with us. So he was tutoring me, my brother, and later my sisters in religious observance.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Let's talk about your experiences with non-Jews when you were a young child because you must have had many of them because there were only two other families.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, in my case, I have to say that the neighbors treated us quite well. We did not experience like in other area because my father employed quite a large number of the villagers. So they had to be quite decent with us. As a matter of fact, I went to school with one of the fellows, who later, I feel that he saved my life because he came to Auschwitz much earlier than me and he had, by the time I arrived in Auschwitz, he was a (sounds like schrieber) on the block. That's a quite high position. And he <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Henry Kolber 6 depending on the livelihood from my father.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And the teachers --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: The teachers --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- did not give you any problem?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The teachers never gave me any problem, because, as -- it was a village. It was not a town. And those teachers used to be involved with my mother because she was more intelligent than the normal villagers. So they came and sometimes socialized together.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you in any youth groups?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you do any sports?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not really. Not organized sports. I played soccer, which was very popular in Poland, but nothing organized.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. When did you first notice a change? What is the first thing that became apparent?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, in 1939, when the Germans start to occupy Poland, some of the inhabitants became Volksdeutsche. That means that they were claiming that their ancestor were from German descent. And they got some positions of importance. And then there were like -- they felt they're much, they are much better and that -- but actually they did not -- maybe there was overt antisemitism. Did not, I didn't feel any repercussion from them except they did not socialize or have anything to do with us.</p><p>This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Do you remember that actual moment when they came to your village?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh, I do remember this because we -- my father felt, the day the war broke, that was September Ist, 19 --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: "39.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: --"39, that we were not very secure in this village. So we packed our belongings on a horse and wagon -- actually, we didn't have no cars -- and went to the next town to be between Jews, where the town was, Stary Sacz (please check). And I would say it was at least 100 to 150 Jewish family live in there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was the name of the town?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Stary Sacz.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And then you stayed there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: We were there for about two days. And there was some incident at this first encounter with the Germans. They order all Jews to assemble on the marketplace. And they selected, I don't remember exactly, ten or 15 of the people, ordering them, and they shot them there. Then --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: This is something you witnessed.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes, I witnessed. That was my first part, encounter with the Germans. And --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You were 16 years old at the time.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, I was 16.</p></p></dialogue>

After the execution of those people, they also selected a hundred of people and locked them up in a school building overnight. My father was between those. And that was quite big shock to the family because we did not know what will happen with those hostages. Next morning, though, they were released and after, oh, I don't know, three, four hours, we packed our belongings and went back home.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And the next experience?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, the next experience was just that from time to time we were inducted in the work groups. In Poland the roads are not paved like we have paved here. They were, like, dirt roads. So we were, during the summer and fall, we built the roads. We chopped the stones that the roads are always ready for the transport of their heavy equipment and - - the German equipment. And in winter we shoveled snow because the climate in Poland was much more severe than we have it here. And we were -- the roads have to be clear for the army to be moved.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Are we talking about summer and fall of 1940 or --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: We are speaking -- no, of winter of 1939.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And the spring and fall and then --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: 1940.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- the winter in "40.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In "40. And what was the name of the town that you were in then?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, that was back to your town.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, I'see. Okay. So you were building roads.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Building roads and cleaning roads of the snow. Of course we, as I previously said,</p><p> there were only two other Jewish family so the workforce consisted of much more. They</p><p> brought Jews from adjacent villages and they were always ready to, we were ready to</p><p> work on --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you living at home at the time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes. I was living at home. And those conditions were to about 1941, when the (sounds like youthenlaut) in Stary Sacz was ordered to select about 100</p><p> young people from (sounds like Ermitz) and to be sent to Rabka, R-A-P-K- <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Henry Kolber 10</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was the only member of my family because -- well, maybe that's the best time to explain. My father was chosen by the man who was the (sounds like <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> Interview with Henry Kolber 11 community of this Rabka was assigned to provide food and shelter for us. And we lived there and went to the school. That was a very short walk, maybe ten minutes" walk, every morning. We walked there in the beginning. We built a shooting gallery, digging in the mountain and preparing the war for -- a shooting gallery they built there to train the new recruits how is the most efficient way to shoot. But after about four weeks spending the time there, the adjacent town, ghettos, were to be liquidated and the people were transported to Rabka. And Rosenbaum had a couple actions. And then we really knew what were our duty were there. We were gravediggers and we bury all people which were killed.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: They had these actions in Rabka.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In Rabka in this particular mountains earlier where the school was there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you said you were a gravedigger.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. The other 90, 90 young men, because there were 90 in the beginning, but later on, seven of us, of the group escaped. And to punish the remain of us, he took 21 and hang. So there were only left about 65 or maybe 70. Life there was, I find that the first came in Rabka gave much deeper impression on us than the large camps or were much more people killed in Auschwitz but more vivid things I remember from Rabka because this commandant spent time. We have seen him every minute of the day and sometimes if he felt like, he came to the camp, woke us up, and direct us running all around the place. And his specialty, he had a reitpeitsche, that's a whip, and if he didn't like someone, he hit them from the back. He cut his eye or -- and by the next action, you were marked that you will be shot. So it was quite hard for a young man to live with this</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So were you living at the camp, though? You had said you were --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, the school was about ten minutes away from the --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Town?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: From the quarters where we lived.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you didn't live with other Jewish families.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. It was made as a small camp, only we had guards on the gate where we lived. It was three small buildings.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh. You slept in barracks?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no, we slept in the -- originally there were Jewish buildings, maybe two family in each. So there were, let's say, eight rooms in each quarters. So put 24 people in each room. Slept on the floor, slept on the beds. But that was a small, very small camp, consisting of 70, 65 people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And what about the food situation?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The food situation? The Jewish community had to provide it. There was somebody who cooked and when we came -- in the morning we got a ration of bread and a coffee.</p><p>And in the evening when we came back to our quarters, we got a soup.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Nothing in the middle of the day?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, nothing in the middle of the day.</p></p></dialogue>

Every four weeks or so, we got a pass to go home, ten each. Each week on a Saturday he permit us to go home, ten of us. Then we waited for our turn. And Sunday afternoon we came back. It was a short ride on a train from time -- from the place where we were living.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you have to wear any identifying signs showing you were Jewish?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: We -- the clothes were only painted yellow stripes. In the beginning, it was not -- oh, yeah, we had the, every Jew had to wear the Mogen David on the white with the blue thing. But otherwise, in the beginning, it was not required in the small camps, work camps, to be any way else identified. Well, this lasted for about two months or three months. And we heard that the ghetto in Stary Sacz, because eventually my parents were also moved from the village where we lived to a ghetto, Stary Sacz, that the ghetto going to be liquidated and everybody going to go -- be sent. So on this particular week, we all got the permit from Rosenbaum to go home to say goodbye to our families. I don't really know if our parents knew exactly the condition because we did not share every brutality as what happened to us and what we have seen to the parents, at least I will speak for myself. I felt that there's no point to burden the parents what is going on with us. They had enough problems of their own. So I did not share too much. I went with general ideas, what's going on, that -- but I did not inform them. They knew that they killed ten of us because ten never came home. But what we were doing, that we were gravediggers and we buried people, I did not share this with them. But there was a general feeling that more or less they knew that they will go to some camp. And Sunday, when we had to go back home, my father took the group, because we still had a couple horses, from the</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

It was not a long ride but it was much better to give us a ride than we should walk because there was no other way to get there. So he came there to say goodbye to us. And I said goodbye to him already and went back almost to the train.</p><p>And in the last minute, I decide to go back and I jumped over the fence, because by the train station there was a fence, to say another goodbye to my father. And the SS guard saw me and started beating me. And it's not the pain of my -- what hurt me but the feeling of my father, who was helpless, that he could not help anything to his son. That was more painful. But eventually we got away. And a few weeks later we found out that the ghetto from Stary Sacz was sent to Treblinka. We knew very well what Treblinka was. Treblinka was just a camp where people went to be killed, gassed. Meanwhile, those actions in Rabka continue in much bigger pace than originally because apparently they felt that this part of Poland has to (youthenlate) -- euthanized (please <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> ontactnstonancedjusietneey for tare blormatierabouttfisenecion</p><p> Interview with Henry Kolber 15</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Were there men and women together?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: To be killed?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes. Men and women together and children that were killed.

In 1968, he came back home to Hamburg and he told the German authority that he's back from the war, he was in the Wehrmacht, that's the army, and he likes to get a pension from the German government. When I arrived to United States, I register for Wiedergutmachung to the -- from German and I got all the -- I gave this organization all the information, which camps I spent and what the name of the commandant were there. So they contacted the German -- the German authority contacted, apparently, the Jewish organization and they got my name. And they send me, first, the prosecutor from the trial sent me a telegram if I am willing to come and first recognize -- they show me pictures of him and I recognize him, if I am willing to go to Hamburg to testify to his trial. In the beginning, I was quite hesitant because it was only "68. I started -- I was married. I had two young children. And to renew the wounds was quite hard for me. But after discussion with my wife, we decide that it's my duty, because there was really, there were only three left from the whole group who were in Rabka who could testify as witnesses to his atrocities. So we went to Hamburg and testified. I had my wife and my two children, then I had only two, right now I have three children, to Germany and I, I testified for, I think, three days there to his trial. And, I don't know, I had a feeling when I was in camp with him that he was a big statue, big, heavy-built man. After I met him on the witness stand, he was just a normal, small -- so apparently his authority of life and death, which he had make in our mind, the statue so big. And he got convicted and he got life in prison. I don't know. I didn't follow this up, if he's still alive or he's out of his -- but at least that was a satisfaction, that, after all, he killed enough Jews but he did not kill everybody. There were some who could witness</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And he was punished. Of course I don't feel that the punishment was -- met the crime but here at least he was punished. And then I -- with the Germans, the young people, I have to say that at this time when we were there, we were treated quite nice. And the Germans had, at the time when we were there, some also guilt feeling because they, I presume they had to ask the fathers where were your grandfathers at this particular time, what did you do during the war. So there was some, I don't know, maybe I'm not -- I had some sympathy with them.</p></p></dialogue>

So they decided they're going to build a camp, a war camp near Krakow by the name of Plaszow. For about two or three weeks, we walked every day, a group of us, from Krakow and then there was another detachment from the ghetto to Plaszow to prepare for the camp because that's where -- their way to build the camp. They had -- apparently, they wanted to eventually evacuate the Krakow ghetto and the people who lived in the ghetto will be sent to the camp.

In other words, I was not very healthy. I just work. Because the work was very, very hard. I -- By the end, after a year and a half working just with the digging ditches and building barracks, I was transferred to a carpenter's factory because a man who was in charge of the carpenter's factory was acquaintance of my father.

That's all. That's short distance. Also, Auschwitz was on a Polish territory and originally Auschwitz was built to accommodate Polish political prisoners. To my knowledge, after I was liberated, I tried to research, I could not find any other transport which came directly to the central, to the center of the camp.</p><p>Generally, all the transports came to Birkenau, where there were selection made to go to work or to go to the gas chamber. This particular transport of 225 from Krakow came directly to the central camp, where there were 20 blocks. There were two-story brick buildings. On 16 blocks people lived who were sent to do outside work. Every morning they came back to work. One block had a hospital. One block was a bunker where all prisoners who tried to escape and they were caught, they were put there. And one block was the experimental block.

You were so conditioned, that whatever will happen, will happen. You did not dwell too much what you gonna do. You start to believe in fate already. There's nothing much you can do. You better don't think too much. Just watch yourself. Not to be too close to somebody who gonna hit you or beat you or whatever. You just try to be in the background and maybe. I had a very strong urge then when I arrived in Auschwitz that if there's any chance to survive, after what I went through, I'll have to survive. And, I don't know -- a good thing, though, that we were there on the quarantine. Each transport who come, was, I think, the whole week we didn't do anything. We could not get out from the block. We got food like normal, four ounces of black bread, coffee, black coffee, and in the evening you got a soup.

So there were some people who were already longer in the camp who were interested always to find maybe their brothers or whoever is family. So they came and tried to ascertain who -- the names and everything else. So after a while, someone somehow told the friend of mine who I lived and went to school with that I am here, you know. So he came visit me and brought me more food. And then after the quarantine, in the beginning, he arranged a good work group for me. I work far. We walked every today. But it was indoors.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I was working in a steam producing -- my duty was they had a big, big oven and that was a factory for cabinets and they brought pieces of wood and I threw in the -- to create steam. It was very easy work and warm. No elements of cold weather go through and everything. So if I wouldn't have lived there -- I mean through this period of, I think I was in Auschwitz four, five months, that's where I came to more strength, because when Auschwitz was liquidated in 19 --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Liberated.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Liquidated. Before -- the Russians were very close so they wanted to send everyone who was in camp away. I was almost on the last transport. It was already middle of December, in winter. And they did not, they could not spare any trucks or wagons. So we marched for two days and two nights. If I wouldn't have the strength in Auschwitz, I could not survive the march.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you with -- was it just men on your march?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes, there was on the particular march was men. And this particular -- in Auschwitz, on the barracks -- I mean on the blocks, it was only men. In Auschwitz, in the central lager, there were only women who were secretaries but they did not live in this particular camp. But a very strange thing, what I still cannot have answered to what happened on this march, sometimes during the march, there was an English military plane going quite low over our heads. And the Germans, the guards got panicky and started to run away from us. And how we were conditioned through this four years, we could not decide for ourselves what to do. So we followed them. We knew very well that there is no way to escape because we were with this blue and white stripes. It's winter. You could not disrobe yourself. And you could not go to a German house. But it is just that the conditioning through so many years, you did not function by yourself. You had to get an order. We didn't get the order to go away -- go turn right; we followed the guards. And it is quite puzzling to me how a human being can be conditioned to do things against their will. So finally --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: How many were in your group? How many people were on your march?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, it's very hard for me to determine how many people.

You did not care what's going on there in the front. You didn't care what's going on on the left side. You were only hoping that you will survive, so. But that was the condition. And you had to apparently adjust to the condition, what they were. And maybe it's, like today, it's not too good to dwell too much what -- how we behaved because, I mean, I don't know -- finally we arrived in a small town in, on some border of Poland and Germany and they gave us a big farmhouse.</p></p></dialogue>

And, well, we didn't know where we were going but we arrived in Buchenwald. In Buchenwald, we were placed on this block for young children. I mean, at least I was placed there.

I was put on the young man's block and this block became quite famous by Elie Wiesel's book, "The Night" where he speaks about Gustav, who was the blockalteste. I lived there and during the day we were not required to go to any work. It is just that once in a while food got more scarce. Instead of every day the rations what we were supposed to get, we got every second day. But they told us, if you volunteer on any transport to another camp, you might get more food. But somehow, I decide that I will stay there, at least I know what's going on here, I don't want to volunteer for any unknown situation.

Anyway, one morning we heard those shots very loud and a few minutes later we had seen the American Army came to the camp. In the first group it was a young chaplain, Rabbi Schacter, who when he saw what's going on there, it didn't take him long, he organized a transport of young people who their health was not very good.

So I had two eggs. Eggs were very valuable in camp. I would have gotten something in camp for that. So the guard randomly looked, he said, "open it."

We didn't take no showers, we didn't take no baths, so they gave us baths. We walked for, I think, two days without clothes, naked, everything, because that was more sanitary than wearing those old, lousy clothes. They burnt everything what we were wearing.</p></p></dialogue>

They went outside to Weimar and they brought some food, the American Army. They confiscated pigs and chicken and everything else and they came and they start cooking and they gave us -- and that was not very good thing because we didn't eat for so many weeks and now we got the food and many of us got really sick, diarrhea and type of illness from overeating. So then they got the rations of soldiers that also donated chocolate, the chocolate helped us. But, see, those soldiers did not expect the condition what occurred there, and they were just trying to help us.</p></p></dialogue>

And Yiddish was -- and I went to school to Gymnasium that was a little (inaudible) learn a little German, because the guards at the commandant gave orders in German, and if you did not respond to the order that was not in favor either. So you had to quickly you had to learn the German. That's why the transport that came to Auschwitz from Greece, those Jews suffered greatly because at least the European Jews understand a little bit Yiddish and they could respond after a while to the orders. But the Greek had a very hard time to understand the language and they were very quickly killed.</p></p></dialogue>

Some Jewish organization, the Zionist organization, because originally we went to Switzerland just for a little health and then go to Israel, because that's the only place we could go. We did not want to go back home to Poland, because we heard about the seven who escaped, escaped the Germans. They came home and they didn't live long because there is one who survived who is in Israel told us because I met him there to the trial he was the one who escaped, six, the poles came with hatchet and killed them. So we did not want to go back to Poland and there was no other place to go, so we decided to go to Switzerland and then go to Israel. But unfortunately England had a blockade to Israel and Switzerland did not permit we could have gone on our own through the borders of Italy, but that's whole thing was illegally and we felt at least the whole group who was in Switzerland from Buchenwald, we decided that we had enough smuggled then, whatever will be when there will be permitted to go here or there we will go. So friends of my parents myname our names were published in Jewish papers in I suppose, through the whole world but here we speak about in United States. And one day I received a letter from friends of my parents who came here much earlier to United States, if 1 am willing to come to United States they will send me papers. I decided I grabbed the opportunity and I came to the United States in 1947.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can we talk about some general questions now about your thoughts and your feelings and your experiences? How do you think the war influenced you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The war influenced me very, very negatively. My I'm still looking for answers to the questions. Where was the world? Where was the Jewish community of the United States where we were there? Today we know that was well known in 1942 that what Hitler was doing with the Jews. It is known also that when Eichmann came to Hungary, because Hungary was the last bastion of Jews, the Jewish community in Hungary saved about 10,000 Jews for money. And they were paid and when they were asked United States government or United States Jewish community were asked to donate more money for some reason, somehow, it was not forthcoming. So sure the blame lies directly on those people who helped Hitler or Germany, but the numbness of the world, of the demographic committee in United States, I still cannot understand. A ship of German refugee came here to this shores and was turned around and sent back.</p></p></dialogue>

It was bombed. Why they never threw at least one or two bombs at the trains which were coming to Auschwitz with the people who died? We were realized the people would have been killed, but they were killed anyway. But the crematoriums or the trains would be wrecked for a couple of days or weeks and at least the destruction would not have occurred as occurred. So Hitler did not hear really any opposition from no one. So he continued to do what his goal was. I get many questions, why the Jew resisted. My answer to them is I resisted for every day, because his aim was to kill me and I am still alive. So what resistant would it be, I mean I am speaking about my personal thing, would it have been better if 1 would escaped and hide someplace and be killed later by a Pole and I knew from right from the beginning we were told in Rabka, that you are responsible for your neighbor, for your person who you are living or who you are working, if he escapes you be killed. I never, never through the whole my living in camps had any time, notion, of taking a life of somebody else on my conscience. There are different types of people. I'm just speaking for myself. And I cannot, and I'm not sorry that I did not know, that I did not do. The next thing what happened in Buchenwald after the liberation, the young army soldiers grabbed few of us who were near, and they immediately, after the marching they took the commandant, previous commandant from the camp, the Germans, with the guards, and put them there closed in the bunk. They came to us and said, come with us, we show you something. They took us to the bunker there and showed us SS lying there on the floor and said, "you want a gun, you want a</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Yeah, very true, there were many of my inmates there who took their advantage, but I felt, and that bothers me today, sometimes, did I act the right I couldn't make myself to happen. Because I felt if I would do this to him, I would lower myself to this position of what he did to me. So I don't know. And sometimes I'm ashamed to tell this, that I was a coward.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. It didn't change much. As I previously said I was never very religious and I am not today. There were questions when I was much younger, where was G d, where this happened. But I cannot blame this on G d or religion or whatever. I accepted what had happened and I feel that maybe it always of suffering ofsome something different comes. I strongly feel that if the Holocaust did not exist, Israel would not exist either. So I feel that maybe the world to do something, that it did not do during the Holocaust, so gave us a country of our own.</p></p></dialogue>

And I speak with schools, I speak with Hebrew schools, and congregations, I go to public schools, and whatever. But my daughter, yes she Ihave one son who is 42 and one son who is 25. The boys, for some reason don't want it when I start talking about some Holocaust, when we have company they walked out.

I feel that I have to complete the circle, the cycle has to be closed. I resisted to go to Poland just purely that I will spend my good money to give to the Poles. But there is something more to it. I have to see the place where I was born, how it is, and then put a lilt salt in their face that I survived. So I'm going with my brother in law and my sister in law. I asked my younger son to go, he doesn't want to go. He belongs to the Hashomer Hatzair, Jewish organizations which go every year the young children go he never wanted to go, but</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: When did you hear about the members of your family, about what happened to them?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In Rabka.
