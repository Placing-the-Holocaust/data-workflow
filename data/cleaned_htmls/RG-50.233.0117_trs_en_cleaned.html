<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They never entered. I have to tell you that was my first, that is even today, one of my worst memories. That we were all already -- Everybody had to bathe, to take a bath, that it was worth that or it was the gas. Everybody had to take everything off and even the hair was cut. We were already without anything. Then the German people were there; they realized that there was a girl with an orthopedic shoe. So one leg was shorter than the other. They took and they realized when she was naked. They took the naked girl out and took her away, naked as she was, because of the foot. Now, I know, later I know that she was taken to the other room to be killed. Because they realized that only when she was naked.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you know this girl?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no. Only I remember the whole story. I have seen the whole story. At that time, I didn't understand, of course, what was happening. But I have the whole picture in my eyes. She was taken naked and killed.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: She was, how old?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Eighteen. A nice young girl. At that time, I used to have very beautiful hair. It was more light than now; it was a very nice color. Now, it is getting dark with age but you saw ---. It was fair and a bit reddish. My mother was very proud of it and when they cut my hair, she just thought, oh your beautiful hair! I remember. Then we entered this thing and then we met the girls from Czechoslovakia who were there already three years. Only a few of them remained alive after three years and they were the kapos, not kapo, lageraltester. They were who ruled the barrack.</p><p>Lageraltester that was the end of the whole lager.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: They were Jewish?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They were Jewish. Every barrack had a head. Lageraltester, that was the German name. They were these Czechoslovakian girls. They were telling us just at the beginning, do you see the smoke there? That is your relatives, your parents. I didn't want to believe it. I was a humanist like my father. I remembered that we had a dead person in our wagon already when we arrived to Auschwitz. I told my mother, they are so, I'm sure many people were dead during this long journey. Therefore the crematorium is running because they have to get rid of the dead people.</p><p>I didn't believe that they were killing the people.

When the Hungarian people came, these last transports of this brick factory, it was called the sigarnalaager, gypsy lager. The number of the lager was called 32C. Later, I learned that the gypsy people were living there with family. It was a family lager. They killed them before the Hungarian Jews were brought there because they needed the place. Very few gypsies who were in Auschwitz survived Auschwitz. Most of them were killed at that time. We came there and the second day or the third day, we were newcomers. We were very stupid. We didn't know the regulations. For instance, we got some bread. Then people were coming and telling if you give me a piece of bread, I give you this pot and you can eat from this pot. One of my friends bought a pot to have a pot from barrack. Later on came, not the Germans, Port, "toot" and then came another one and took it away because it was not allowed to have the pot. The pots were distributed before getting the food and then it was collected again. You couldn't own a pot and the people who sold the pot for bread knew it but she was hungry. Morika, that was Morika.</p><p>We were stupid and I don't know, somehow, they arranged a transport from Yangers and we were standing there and one person was missing. I think one person was running away from this transport and they needed somebody. We were standing there with mother and they just took me and pushed me in this transport and we were separated. If 1 were not so stupid, some days later, I would run away again but I didn't run away. That was the transport, I was separated from mother. Then they took us to the next lager, took we to be which had only the wire, which was separated with this electrical wire from the other one where mother remained.</p><p>I was there. I sleep and I heard they wanted to send for work, these transports. But it turned out that somebody had scarlet. Scarlet fever from these transports. So they stopped all the transports and we had to remain there. So mother was here and I was there. I could speak to her. It was not so easy but I have spoken to her every day, but in the very early morning because there were these towers in Auschwitz and in every tower was a German, an SS. If he thought that at the wire, there are too many people, he shot. I have seen with my eyes two girls who were shot. One was speaking with her sister who was on the other side and one was speaking with her mother. I have seen two girls who were shot.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was risky. So I told mother, I will come only in the very early morning when he is still sleeping and not awake.

Then I told her if you need aspirin, bring a glass of water or something and you have to take it before me. I would have give anything for bread, but I didn't want that I gave somebody an aspirin that she should sell it. Then I had --.</p></p></dialogue>

I remember my twentieth birthday that was October 13". It was a very ugly day because somehow later, they brought Polish people to this . Polish people with children. I don't know from where they came. For instance, the head of the barrack where I was, she gave -- she liked very much one of these children. She was three years old, the child. She was born in a camp already. A baby girl. She was there with her mother. Somehow, she like this child and she gave her food every day for this three years old girl. That was my anniversary when they collected all these Polish children, to kill; to take them away and kill them. The child, this small child, whom I knew through this head of the barrack, whom I see often, she was taken away too. Then I asked the head of the barrack, will they kill all the children? And she told, oh yes. Then we knew already what is happening. The big head of the , when the selection was, the big trucks came to the lager and people were just, were black.

It was an ammunition factory and some people were there. Somehow, this Sonderkommando through a girl who was working there, got ammunition. They blew up the crematorium and tried to escape in the commotion. But they didn't succeed. I have seen it because it was so that; there were people in the block who had to bring the food for, the evening food.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no. Ihave seen the SS. It was very close, the road, the lager road. The kitchen was close to the lager road and I have seen how the SS people are running after the explosion to the crematorium. They were so, it was so unexpected that they were just taken aback in running, do you understand me?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It turned out that this was the revolution of the Sonderkommando. They could recollect everybody, nobody could escape.

The girl <span class="page-break" number="17"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> was taken and she was killed too and nobody could escape. That's it, what I wanted. That is what I wanted to tell you. It was so that it was the custom or how to tell it, that when they brought new transport with the train, then it was blockspera, it means that you couldn't leave the barrack where you were. You had to stay there all the day, not to see. But somehow, --. I remember when they brought new people. For instance, from Slovakia, they first, as ve told you, only the girls were taken away. The unmarried girls. For instance, one, a cousin of mine who used to live there was taken because she was unmarried but two others who were married could stay there. They were taken later on in September from Slovakia to Auschwitz. I remember when they brought this transport, when the transport was coming and how few people could enter the lager. Maybe, I don't know how many they brought. After my mother, because a sister of my mother used to live in Yeetro and the whole family. I told mother that they were brought, I have spoken to people who entered the lager and so I knew that they were taken and that nobody among them, entered the lager. I remember that I told mother that your sister came and her family, her two daughters and husbands, and grandchildren and nobody entered the lager.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They won't miss me. In the evening, I told my mother I couldn't go away. I remain here.</p><p>Somebody was with my mother and other mother who had three daughters in the group. She ask me do you know anything about my three girls? I told her yes, they went. She said, oh they left me here. To tell the truth, they were smart. Later it turned out, when I was at home, it was years and years after, I met a girl, I met a girl with whom I slept under one blanket. She told me that this transport was already good. They went to a small town somewhere in Czechoslovakia.</p><p>They worked in a factory. The work itself was not too hard. The people in these small towns were very helpful. They gave them food whenever they could. Only one person died. It was six hundred people and only one died, one of them with natural -- something happened to her.</p><p>That was not a bad trip. All the others came back.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you know what they were making in the factory?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't know exactly. I was not so interested in that kind of factory. It was maybe a textile or something. She worked in Tunsaran. She was from Budapest but she worked in Tunsaran and so she was as the sister of your friend.. So she was taken away. It was not allowed to commute, the Jewish people couldn't commute. They were exempt, they saw they are exempt and they worked in Tunsaran and they used to leave that. Then the German took everybody who was working in Tunsaran. Tunsaran is a big factory which exists even now in Hungary. The bulbs, they are making bulbs and --.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, light bulbs.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes and it was a very important thing and the first Jewish people who worked there were exempt. They can stay there and work.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: This was in Budapest?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was Ujpest, the suburb. So that is that. It is one of the biggest factories in Hungary. So I couldn't go away and some weeks later, mother was taken away. I told myself, now it is no reason to stay here any more and I go away with the next transport. The next transport where I went, which was chosen, went from one part of the lager to the other part. That was the whole transport. It was the oldest part and all the circumstances were much worse. It was Ausenkommando, I told you, we had to work. We had to dig potatoes inthe pun___--.-~ We had to put potatoes in heaps and cover with earth. It was raining, everything was wet; all the potatoes got rotten. One day we were -- and it was a very heavy work because you had to carry it across; it was a hard work. You had to carry the potatoes. One day it was put there, the other day we had to remove them from there. It was silly work only it was very, very difficult, very hard work. In this potato, I got ill very soon. I was not so strong any more. I never was a strong person and I got ill. In the meantime, the evacuation of the camp was continued and we were taken from this old part of this lager back to where I used to be, back to this relatively new part, this B2B where I have known all the physicians.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It's still 1944?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was 1944, that was November, late November already. In Auschwitz, there were two reviers for ill people, not two parts, two sections. One was the E section for women, it was only one and F section for men. In the small revier, in B2B, they couldn't help me and if you are more serious ill, you had to be taken to this E section. I was taken to this E section and later I met one girl of Ujpest, of my town, saw me when I was taken to the E section -- not alone, with several people. She told me later in Ujpest, I was sure that you are taken to be killed. I never thought that we will again meet each other here in our town because I was so upset and I was sure that you were taken away to be killed ["Who?"] I tell you later. I don't know only the name but several times I have met her in Ujpest. I was taken to this E sector and that was maybe December already. In January, 18" of January, and I was bad, and I had malaria because I had temperature; the temperature rose suddenly disappeared. I had four or five of these and I was again without a temperature. I was there with many other people. It is January. It was told that everybody who can run, who can walk have to go and to leave the camp. A transport will go and it was told that there are no trains, you have to walk. All my clothing was __ wrong, it was greenish, something green and the very same one and a pair of shoes.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Nightshirt and a pair of shoes. But then we managed some and everybody in the revier had clothing. But somehow, we managed to get clothes. Then it was not the strict order anymore.</p><p>My friends brought me some clothes. It was a coat and a Jacket. I got some clothes. Then it was a full day, everybody got a loaf of bread and it was told that everybody who can walk must go. Then we were some young girls and we decided not to go. We thought we are not strong enough, we cannot walk. They will kill us if we can't walk. The only chance to survive is to stay here and to see what will happen. That's the only chance. If we go, we are sure that we will be killed. We were maybe five girls. We decided to stay and we will see at that time, we had the clothes and we will see what will happen.

At the river, was a big battle. It lasted two days. It was on the 27", we have seen and we have heard the battle. That was our chance. We had no electricity in the camp and we had no water. Itwas_ sin the case of fire, this water, because there was running water in the camp. It was not anymore running.</p><p>We had fuel, we had coal to heat, we could heat the barrack.

That was in the night and at 8 o'clock in the morning, he was at my bed and asked me what happened to you, in the daytime you were not so ill. I have seen you at noon and everything was okay with you and what happened to you in the night that you were so ill? He knew everybody and he visited and from that time, I remember, that several times at midnight, I awake that he is standing at my bed and feeling my pulse, my heart rate. He knew everybody, he was an excellent person.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The story with my illness. I told you that I was one of the four most ill persons. This Russian military hospital was dissolved in "45, September. In "45 September, I was certified (??) tuberculosis already and they took me to Krakow because I couldn't walk yet. They took me to Krakow, the university clinic. Ten more months, I had to stay there. I was there and I returned to Hungary 46, the 1 of August. It was very difficult for me to come back, I had no documents, only one small paper which I got from the Polish Red Cross that I was this number and with my name, that I was liberated in Auschwitz by the Russian army. It was written on this paper that everybody is asked to help me get home. In "46, everybody was at home already, or everybody died, and I had to walk to Ka__ to the Red Cross and they couldn't arrange me to go home, the permission to go home. I went to the council, to a high- ranking officer in Ka__ I know who he was. I was told if I give him sum, I can leave the camp. He will give me document and I can go wherever I want but I have no money. He told me if I go, that the paper that you have is nothing. If I go to the Russian people, I can get the same paper from them. It is nothing like you have. I was very angry. I decided that I will go to the State Department in Russian. I have to find somebody who will believe me, that I am Hungarian and a Jew and I have to go home.

They all were killed by the Germans there. Somehow, because the wife told that I don't leave him to go alone and I go with him, somehow, this very simple Christian woman, she could save his life. They came back from Ukraine with the same paper that they got somehow, the same paper what I had. I came home with this group. At the frontier, it was "46, the Russian officer didn't like us to enter the country. They say they will have to check who we are. We had to stay at the border; it was joined there already, this Jewish organization from here, from the state. They gave us food, they gave us where to sleep. We had to wait there. That was on the Hungarian border. I knew, somehow, these are Hungarian- speaking people who are living in this village.</p><p>I spoke to somebody because in this village used to live the brother-in-law of this boy with his sister. They used to live in this village. What do you know about Mr. Mueller, this boyfriend who disappeared in Russia. I asked the people, do you know Mr. Mueller?
