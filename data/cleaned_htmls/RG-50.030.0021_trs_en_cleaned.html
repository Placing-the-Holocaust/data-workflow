<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was born on August the 7th, 1912 in Czernowitz, the capital of Bukovina. It was, until 1918, part of the old Austrian-Hungarian monarchy. In 1918, it was uh given to to ...by the powers to Romania; and in 1940 it was occu...on uh June the 28th, 1940, it was occupied by the Soviets as compensation for twenty years of Romanian occupation of Bessarabia. It hadn't been for over two hundred years part of any Russian empire. It...1 would say it was occupied as a result of the Stalin-Hitler pact, and uh the same criteria should apply to it as they applied today to the Baltic States. Uh in these forty years, the Russians have been able to change demographically the population of Czernowitz. Interesting is the fact that they have attracted a large group of Russian Jews to Czernowitz...</p></p></dialogue>

She was a fine pianist, excellent uh uh accompanist. As a matter of fact, she accompanied uh uh a well-known singer by the name of Selma Kurtz in Vienna uh as an accompanist. She had a fine technique but uh marrying my father, this uh really brought an end to her music career. She played for us and uh instilled in us the the love for music, especially since her specialty was uh uh lied[er]. You know, I was familiar with lied[er] as a small child.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Could you describe the life for Jews at that time in your childhood?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Czernowitz had a very active uh uh Jewish community, culturally. Uh the Jewish community had produced quite a few remarkable people in Jewish uh uh cultural, in Jewish cultural history. Itzic Manger (ph) is one of the uh these figures and the well-known and famous, uh fablist (ph) is this could be the term which I could use...he was uh...I just missed the name...uh, well I'll come back. Eliezer Steinbe...Steinberg (ph). Eliezer Steinberg wrote beautiful fables fables in Yiddish. It uh...Czernowitz had a permanent Yiddish theater, uh Goldfaden_ Theater. It had a permanent uh German and Romanian theater, national theater they called it, which was a replica of the uh of the opera from Vienna. Beautiful building.</p><p>Excellent acoustics and uh uh there were uh so-called part-time German, uh Ukrainian and and uh Polish uh cultural organizations. Uh in...as soon as Hitler came to power in Germany, things changed. The Germans...we had a large German population in...out in the suburbs, especially which were uh uh...not Schwabian...1 don't know from where they uh really came...and uh their political uh attitude changed. Hitler and his propaganda ministry were quite active and the same happened in the other German colonies in Romania. Romania had...in Bessarabia there were Schwabian colonies which were for a long time already that they came to Bessarabia under Katherine the Second. Uh then Transylvania had uh Saxon, especially in the southern part Fagaras-Brasov. Uh the Banat had also Schwab Germans and uh naturally as their attitude toward Jews and uh and uh as apparent of the new National Socialist inclination of the German people, uh uh fell on a very fertile ground. Uh in the late "30's the uh Romanian government fell under the influence of the Iron Guard, first Cuza- Goga, then government, then the Iron...then the Iron Guard had a tremendous influence. It was very anti-Semitic. It was a chauvinistic movement which aligned itself uh intimately with Hitler under Marshall Antonescu to a degree where they took part in the anti-Soviet campaign with uh two armies. So did the Hungarians and uh voluntary uh the voluntary uh divisions from Spain and from France, does not matter (ph), and from Belgium.</p></p></dialogue>

You have to go to Hungary. Jews in Hungary in that time, 1941, were still alright. We had...Gabriel Zinreich, my friend, had a Hungarian-speaking wife and he put us on a truck to Munkacs. But in order to get to Munkacs we had to pass through Poland, through the General Government, and it happens that when we passed the bridge uh over the Dniester in Horodienka we got picked up by Hungarian gendarmerie, uh beaten and uh we ended up later in the ghetto, in a little ghetto in Poland. And here started our Polish episode which had to...which turned out to last the whole war and ended up in 1944 where I joined the Polish army.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell me about the time in the ghetto.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The ghetto where we ended...where we lived was a little town. It, it was fascinating to me. I had never seen a uh a uh an establishment like Korolovka (ph). It was a small town. It had no railroad station. It had no sanitation. It had no water supply. It had no electricity. It uh...you had a wasser treiger (ph) who had to bring the water to the people who paid him. You uh...you uh...there were approximately sixteen to eighteen hundred Jews in that little ghetto.</p><p>It was a natural ghetto. It was like a stetl from the time of, which Shalom Alehem described.</p><p>I have never been in such a stetl and uh for me it was really fascinating to to to to study it. It uh...one doctor. One Jewish doctor. One Jewish dentist. The doctor was Dr. Teibers (ph) and everyone had a sufix in Yiddish. Dr. Teibers was called Tiberhazel. The dentist was called...his name was Gunie Wiesenthal...was called Gunie Pipick (ph) because he was uh heavy. Uh the Jews lived around a remick (ph), the ring platz (ph) in the center of which was a pharmacy. Magister Schwartz was the the pharmacist. These were attached houses but the the Germans didn't really need to establish a ghetto. There was a natural ghetto right there.</p><p>They just established that no gentile had...be permitted to come into that area and no Jew is permitted to go out. It was difficult to reinforce this because the borders of that ghetto were quite uh loose, so it happened that these Jews were able to communicate with the farmers.</p><p>Having done commerce and business with them for so many years, they knew each other and uh life was naturally easier than in the bigger cities. Uh we had problems with food. I saw immediately that uh uh I have to to do something to uh to establish a source of food and uh I went to that Dr. Teibers if he could direct to me his uh overflow. He said there is really no overflow at this time, and you know, uh in that time you didn't pay for a visit. You, you...the farmers or the people who came for medical consultation paid in uh in food. So...but he said...and he gave this advice. If you get the permission to practice outside the ghetto in the little community, because there are no doctors around here, uh we...you you could uh you could survive. I would like to mention here the attitude of the Jews in that little ghetto. When I came in, the Russian had left. The Russian had been there, in Korolovka, since the seventeenth of uh September of uh 1939 when they entered the eastern part of Poland, and there was...the attitude of the Jews was not uh friendly towards the Soviets. Many Jews had been deported. So were many Ukrainian who had been deported, especially Ukrainians who</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Ukrainians were very uh very nationalistic in their political aspiration and as soon as Hitler attacked Russia, the area was flooded with uh leaflets in which uh they uh were proclaiming that the time had come to establish the uh Volna Ukraina (ph), that means the free Ukraine. The leaflets were signed by a Ukrainian uh uh uh leader by the name of Stephan Bandera who established a group of people later who uh carried his name and they were called Banderovitsis (ph). Very anti- Semitic and very anti-Soviet. They said the time has come to proclaim the free Ukraina, to kill the Jews and the Communists. The uh...I didn't know how to go about getting the permission and I was directed to what the chief of the Judenrat , the Judenaltester who was a man by the name of Max Glickstern, Glickstern. Max Glickstern was married to a uh woman from the Bukovina by the name of Hilda, Hilda uh Zinreich and was a cousin of the, my friend Gabriel Zinreich, so I had access to him. He was a businessman who never did very well, but when he came to the ghetto he was already nominated to be the elder of the Judenrat . Uh he uh lived like a king really. He had power. Also, being a small community but the powers uh con...uh con...confer power to a human being and his attitude changes completely and uh it did on uh Max too. While I would have to say that in many instances he behaved very honestly, still people who had money to bribe and the Judenrat was bribable to a very, very large degree. So was everybody. Uh there's...uh belonging to their admini....to the so-called Jewish administration uh he gave me a uh a...he got for me letter signed by a priest in a small community uh outside Korolovka by the name of Bicewslote (ph). He directed me. He sent letters to the uh lecaspoiutove (ph) which was the Kreisars (ph) of the of the Ukrainian physician who was in charge of the area, and he gave me permission to the...uh to practice there. The letter from the priest was signed by a priest by the name of Stamosese (ph) who was the leader of the Ukrainian organization. And we were brought by a uh uh man whose family later survived the war by the name of Sturmer who was a person who had intimate contact with the farmers around Korolovka. He still managed to keep a couple of horses hidden in someplace outside the ghetto and he brought us to Benceslote (ph) and now started for me a a very interesting uh uh practice. It lasted no more than six months because the area was later declared in May uh "42 Judenrein . When we came there uh he brought us to the house of the man by the name of Samy Reinstein who had a who had a dwelling where he had what they call it propinatzia. He sold liquor, schnaps and uh small uh items to the farmers. Right now he didn't have any more that store and he was able to rent us a few uh a couple of rooms. Uh the next day he he told me I should go to introduce myself to the priest being the leader of the community. Father Shamosheshin (ph) spoke some German. He was a lean mean in his early fifties or late forties. He uh uh was very non- committal. He said for twenty-five years I had asked the Polish government uh to send a physician here. Uh the Germans had to come finally to make it possible for Benceslote to have a physician. Benceslote was also known that it had a large estate belong to an absentee land-lord by the name of Count Sapira (ph). The count...the estate had been uh taken over by the Soviets and transformed into a state farm and the Germans left it the same way. A week later an event occurred which uh which was important. Somebody knocked at the window of our of our room and uh when...Mr. Reinstein, Samy Reinstein opened the door, he said Doctor, it's for you. They want you to come immediately to the priest. The wife of the priest This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

I, having his assurances that this, the call was genuine because I was afraid to go in the middle of the night, I uh...the man who who had come for me was a militant (ph) from the militia, Ukrainian militia. I found the uh the wife of the priest in severe upper abdominal pain. She had a gall bladder attack, gall stones. She said she had it for many years. She was in agony. She was perspired, begging to help her and so was her husband, uh the priest. I had one ampule (ph) of a synthetic morphine opium (ph) preparation, , which I gave her <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> she stopped bleeding. They kept her for three or four days in the hospital and uh I want you to know this was a time there weren't knowing the transfusions. There were no even transfusions. That operating room had no oxygen. Nothing. No suction. Nothing, but it functioned. It was 19 uh 41, "42 now. It uh...he brought her home and a week later he showed up in uh where I worked, embraced me and said Doctor, I don't know, I don't have the money to or how to pay you, but remember if the time will...I know you have a hard time...if circumstances will come that you will need help, come to me. I took it as a uh as an empty uh uh thank you and didn't pay too much attention, but it stayed, stayed in the back of my mind and really later it it uh uh was a lucky incident. When the area was declared Judenrein we returned to the ghetto. Do you want to ask me something?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No. It's fine.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It's alright? We returned to the ghetto and now a very hard life. Uh food. Food and during the summer of "42 we heard that this was the rumor that the of the Gestapo from Stanislow (ph) is around in the area liquidating ghettos. That means aktion. We established a uh guard every house. In that time I stayed in the house of a certain Aaron Spotheim, in the ghetto. Aaron Spotheim had a of : , that means how much. That means he was a bad man. He was really a...not a very friendly uh person. Uh the whole ghetto real...uh really didn't like him very much but he he uh let us in and so we were happy there and with his help when the aktion star...in the area started, we we decided to build our own bunker or our own front. Being uh what he was, , he said nobody should <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> they...you had to consider them educated people to a large degree in comparison to the other people in the ghetto who who were not educated, who didn't have any university schooling.</p><p>It uh behaved in such a way...the circumstances created it. Example. During the summer of "42, seeing that I really had nobody to rely on...I'm a stranger...I'm a foreigner...who is going to help me? I had...we had no money. I started to explore the area around Korulovka. In one of these explorations I got into another ghetto by the name of Czortkow (ph). It was a bigger ghetto. It had five thousand Jews there and the leader, the Judenaltester, was a lawyer by the name of Dr. Ebner (ph). You know in the old Austrian-Hungarian monarchy, every lawyer was called Herr doctor. I wanted what they called a psheapuska (ph). Pshepuska in Polish means a passirchein (ph), a permit, because I wanted to make my way or to find a way toward the border. The border was Zaleszezyki. It uh...when I uh sent a militia man in ann...to say if Dr. Ebner can receive me, I don't know what the militia if he understood very well, but I ended up really in front of Dr. Ebner who said, who are you? What do you want?</p><p>Very hostile. I said, look. I'm a physician from Czernowitz, you know, Czernowitz. As a matter of fact I was trying to...Czernowitz had a a deputy by the name of Meyer Ebner...I say...the same last name... said you probably must be related. He said, sure I'm related. What do you want? His attitude was...he called the militia man in and told him in Polish uh Czortkow. That means search him. I didn't know what...and he said uh see if he had, if he has grini papimna (ph). That means dollars. I didn't have any. He says what do you want? I say I would like a , a pshapuska (ph). He said, look doctor. I have no time. You are bothering me. You take my time away. I have...I have my people to take care of. Get out of my ghetto or I'll give you over to the Gestapo myself. I was really amazed at that hostile reaction and I was very depressed. I left that ghetto because he said in ten minutes you have to disappear from my ghetto. Alright. Czortkow was a city which looked or is a city which looked like a fortress. It had big uh tall uh uh walls. It was one of the eastern cities of the old Austrian-Hungarian monarchy and probably for protection against invasions from the east, but it was a a frightening city. I left the city in a hurry. I was disappointed. I was angry. I was hungry, tired, and I came and throwing me out of the ghetto, Dr. Ebner saved my life.</p><p>Outside the ghetto, I was exhausted. I looked for a place, a , and I fell asleep. Until in the morning I heard uh I heard engine uh noise. I looked out and I saw trucks filled with police, German police, Ukrainian police. They were liquidating the ghetto in that day. By throwing me out of the ghetto, he had uh really saved my life. To make a long story short uh at the end of September, beginning of October, finally the aktion took place in It <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> of two hundred and fifty Jews. I am going to say to the community hide. Whomever it will, it will hit it will hit but I'm not going to make. And he left the meeting. So now everybody was finishing or starting to to to uh because everybody knew it is it is...the end is near and uh the result of that aktion was really disastrous. It wasn't two hundred and fifty. It ended up around fourteen hundred were taken and it explains to a large degree what has been discussed so many times in the last years. Was it correct or was it right or was it fair from the Judenrat or the Judeneltester...I just read the book about Rumkovski, the chief of the Lodz ghetto, you know, to give out in order to save the community a certain number of Jews. Here Max Glickstein had re...had refused to give out two hundred fifty and later we asked ourselves the question...if he would have given the two hundred and fifty, you know, there would have remained uh fourteen hundred still there. But it was a a a question which nobody really could uh answer satisfactorily. Uh some two hundred, hundred eighty or two hundred Jews who whose hiding place were not found, were uh were uh survived. I witnessed one scene where a uh a tailor by the name of Singer whom I had known in the ghetto uh was on his knee before a German and said, herr Gestapo, . He looked at him... <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0 these are murderers. Well, he said, there is a man outside the ghetto who waits with a carriage or the , you know, to take whoever...if you want to go. He'll pay you whatever you want. I went back and I told Gusti this will be the only way to get some food. I didn't tell her that it is to Oxenetz because why should...she heard later while I was away. I knew that in the area was an epidemic of diphtheria and when I came out the...the outside the ghetto, I found a militia, a Ukrainian militia man with the cap of where they have the emblem of the Ukrainian uh organization. The Ukrainian Nationalist organization had the, was OUM, for uh Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists, Organizationa Ukreinski Nationalistiv (ph) in Ukrainian, and their militia men had an emblem...they call it the trizub (ph). Trizub is a trident . It looked like a trident and they have it on top of their cap. He had a trident thing and he had a I thought it was a frisky horse. There were two uh wheels in the front, two in the back and something...and we had to sit sideways on it because there was no...there were no sides walls on it. Anyway I said before we leave I would like to pass by a...what we called the convent. There were two Polish nuns who uh who provided the population with uh sporadically this drugs, medications and I passed by...I knew the nuns because one of the nuns a throat infection. Being an ear, nose and throat man, Dr. Teibers a year before had told me, had sent me there to see them because the nuns, you had to to to treat for free and Dr.</p><p>Teibers was not very much interested to treat for free and this was the reason why he was called over . Anyway I...they gave me a serum, two ampules of serum I think around ten cc's each, large ampules, and uh whose date of expiration was...as a matter of fact I don't remember it...there was a date of expiration. I took these two ampules and we not knowing if I'm going to use it. We...after four, five hours we arrived in Oxenetz and entering I saw empty houses that the wind was was was uh uh...the empty windows without glass panes were uh uh and he shout...the man shouted and said in Ukrainian to me...used a very derogatory word. He says . Here our Jews lived. Our Jews. But he <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 1 Just a medical call and I will leave. I realized immediately if that if that child is not going to recover I don't think I'll recover or I'll survive it. But to make a long story short, I was hungry so I said look, I didn't eat the whole day. Oh, he said, food...no problem. He called his wife.</p><p>He said why don't you make the doctor...and he said pane doctor. That means herr doctor. So Luh said make me a a uh uh five eggs, this slanina, this bacon and they put a bottle of vodka.</p><p>I had three drinks. I ate it. I felt good and I fell asleep. When I woke up uh some ten or twelve hours later and now it was morning, next day, ten o'clock. I went in to see my patient.</p><p>He was breathing slightly better. He still still had some but we were able to force a little water or cold milk in his throat. I uh didn't know, I didn't have what to do so meantime somebody else came and said doctor, could you see my wife. So my fee in that time was two chickens for a cold, so I asked the wogt if he'd give me permission. He said sure, why not.</p><p>Anyway in the evening, at the end of the second day I I was a a lucky uh uh proprietor of six chickens. I had three. I slept the second. I ate and drank well and the third day they...the child was breathing now much better. It was...it...the the serum had... was very worried. The serum at that time was not a very concentrated serum and uh there were a lot of reactions, the reaction what we called serum disease. It...you could have really serious uh uh side reaction, sometimes even fatal. Anyway, that child had absolutely no no side effects. He recovered.</p><p>The fourth day he was fine. He asked for food. He had now a little bit of a...still around hundred, hundred and two, being that, you know, the European thermometers were from thirty-six degrees Celsius so...centigrade...so uh I said, I asked the wogt how do you uh...do you think I could leave. He says oh yes. Never said thank you. The only uh person who came forward was the wife, his wife. Not the mother of the...the mother of the child didn't leave the child but the grandmother, the wife of the wogt. She came out, took my hand and said in Ukrainian, doctor, thank you very much. You are a good man. You saved my grandchild and the wogt said, the car...here is the man who brought you. I said...oops, I'm sorry...he said...I'm sorry ..he uh said uh... had asked for what they call a koretz (ph) of... is hundred kilo, two hundred pounds of uh wheat, kernels. He said no problem. I found the hundred kilos on the carriage...on the briska. Meantime I had twelve chickens. The moth...the grandmother of, the wife of the wogt had told me she's going to take care of and really everything was on the carriage and I asked the man when he finally arrived at Korulovka at the ghetto...this was . That means the aktion...1 am I am coming back.</p><p>Aktion had not taken place yet. In no time the whole ghetto, you know, uh knew that the Romanian doctor is with a whole...meantime the rumor that I am bringing a tremendous amount of kernels back. To make a long story short, we had wheat only twenty kilos, not twenty I don't know. Twenty pounds of that kernels we were able to turn into into flour and to bake it. The rest got lost during the inspection of a uh agricultural, German agricultural inspectors. They inspected the ghetto and this was really to to get the food out of the ghetto.</p></p></dialogue>

I knew more about the Shutzbund. In Vienna the Shutzbund in Vienna was an organization, was a fighting organization of the Social Democrats in Vienna who had fought against Dolfuss when he was Chancellor of Vienna and uh they were beaten and why he told us this story I didn't understand. Maybe he felt we were candidates to any uh...but he...uh then he started to talk about the Jews. He was already drunk and he said to us in German, to me, uh yeah, Juden .

Anyway we found...we had made an appointment with the Ukrainian fellow who took us to a place uh where he fed us really and uh hid us and two weeks or ten days later, there was an alarm. We had to run. During running there was panic. We ran in different directions. We lost each other and Gusti and I ended up together out in the woods. Meantime it was cold. We didn't have where to go. I'm reminded now the promise which Mr. Zarevski, the husband that Pole had told me...it took me one and a haLf days to get. He was in a little town...I think Smikow (ph), I don't remember exactly. He lived in a hut outside...I knew where he lived because he had brought me to see his wife there and uh was hard to get there. It was outside...he he tried to keep a very low profile, being Polish and I...then later I understood why. Because it turned out he was a member of the underground, the Polish underground. When I knocked on his window it must have been four o'clock in the morning. Uh I heard somebody moving inside.</p><p>Finally he opened and then I told through the window who it is. I uh...he opened and let us in. We were exhausted. He gave us some food. He let us sleep there and then he said, look, uh uh this is a bad place for you to stay. I didn't understand why. To me it looked like a very good place. But he said this is... have to find a hiding place for you. A week later or six days later, he said I found somebody. He took us on a tour which lasted probably three hours, way into the woods, and he, on the way there, he said the furster (ph)...furster is a a uh uh Polanization or Ukrainization of the German word . It means a man who takes care of the woods, of uh uh...he's a representative of the of the county, in the woods. He sort of uh uh surveys the cutting of trees where they ma...where they collect wood for the winter. He he uh sells or gives the wood out to certain people in certain communities. He's an official person. We met him there and he again said...we came there. The first thing we ate something after these three and a half hours of walk and uh he was very respectful toward Mr. Zaresvki, as if he would be his superior. I didn't understand why. Whatever he...and that he knew about us already and he said yes, I have a place for you, but not here where he lived...he he was with his wife there. He was a rep...he spoke Polish with Mr. Zarevski. He had certain loyalties toward the previous administration because he was the official representative of the Polish uh community there. He was an employee of the State, not of the county, and...but he was very respectful toward Mr. Zarevski, and they brought us to a barn some four kilometers far in the woods, an empty building - hay with an at...so-called attic, you know, and uh we...in the attic there was something which looked like a bed as if somebody had slept. I understood why he brought us there. That means if somebody would find out that Jews are there, he could say he didn't know anything about it. He said he will visit us every week. He gave us a couple of uh blankets and he gave us some food. <span class="page-break" number="12"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 4 he said he's going once a week to visit us, night time, and really uh it happened. For three weeks he came every week, brought us food. One day I saw around six o'clock...it was already slightly dark...two figures coming. It turned out to be Zarevski and Janek.</p><p>was the name of the person, and uh uh uh Zarevski or Zaremski, said I want to talk to you personally. My wife...so , the first thing, my wife uh sepa...stayed aside and he <span class="page-break" number="13"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 5 is...militia is coming there. He doesn't know why they are coming but he heard one militia man who had a a Polish mother, you know, who had still...had told him about it, and uh apparently also uh was on the run. Something had happened. He didn't tell me what <span class="page-break" number="13"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 6 run away because I had maybe fifty or sixty dogs start a whole...you know, naturally immediately their owners will come out to investigate what's going on, so this was bad because we could be found out and uh uh the stricter interdiction by our hosts were not to go too far, to stay...and I had impression while I walked...this must have been in April...it was already, or May uh that uh...oh yes...meantime because of that knitting business, the attitude of our hosts had had started to improve. It was only bad when they got drunk or had a fight, and usually then they uh then they had uh...they drank and they got a little high. They started to have a fight. It had to do with Polish-Ukrainian or I don't know because I didn't hear but there were times when he hit her and then she was yelling, but these were not good uh omens for us because uh if somebody would have found out that he was hiding Jews, he would, he could have been shot. Anyway, coming back, walking outside, I had the impression somebody is following me, and I went in circles, walking a little farther than usually, and I heard uh...really I was sure now somebody followed me because I heard...he must have stepped on on a on dry branches. I heard them uh the noise of uh branches until finally somebody told me from behind, hands up, , and...in Russian, and went through my pockets. I had a knife with me. They took my knife away and...he took my knife and not they. He took my knife away. Told me to lie down with my face down and started to inter...who I am and so I told him look, uh Romanian...now I told immediately I'm a Romanian physician, you know, and he said uh...he used the term evrei (ph) Evrei (ph) is a Russian term for Jews, but not derogatory. Uh it uh it means you are a Jew, but it's not a derogatory term. It's uh it's the way how in their, in the Russian passports you are being uh uh indicate your nationality. He wanted to know with who I am, where I am, how long I have been there, how uh...well, he said, uh I want to see...in next week I'm going to be here. I saw immediately he doesn't belong to the local Ukraine. I was afraid he might be a Banderovtzi (ph) from the Ukrainian uh organization which killed Jews. He was not. He didn't have the trizub. He uh he uh he had a a German uh uh sub-machine gun, a Schmeisser and uh didn't tell me...I asked him...he didn't answer. He says I would like to talk to, to see your wife. I want to see if it's correct. Alright. A week later or ten days later..we had made an appointment. I brought Gusti there. What could I do. Yes, he said, no word to your house about me. I don't trust them. I don't know them. No word. And I came the uh first thing, when I came with Gusti to meet him, also night time, he looked at her, as much as he could see her in the dark. He said do you follow my orders. I didn't know what he meant. I said not to tell your host anything...orders, he said. So it was a military term, you know, and I didn't know...now he told us who he was. He said his name was Vasia. He is a part of an organ....of a parachute group which were uh parachuted near Tarnopol and they have to prepare the terrain for a large group. He said...I said how large. He said close to a thousand people. A thousand people parachuting... didn't sound to me very, very uh...yes he said. He mentioned a General Kovpak, K - O - V - P -A - K. He's their leader and he will come with the big group. He has to, orders to prepare and he says they have to fulfill an order, he says, but nobody in our...only a few people know our task, what we have to perform. Later I found out the whole group is supposed to destroy the industrial triangle in northwestern Galitzia , three in Borsczow. There were mines. There were oil, you know, and two weeks later <span class="page-break" number="14"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 7 friendliness he brought us a kolbasa. Kolbasa is the Russian term for salami, for kilbasi (ph), you know, and he brought a piece of bread and uh...terrific delicacy for us. The second time when he came he brought us some uh salted uh lard. Salted lard was one of the preferred things for us, because if you spread...a little piece would keep you the whole...it was rich in calories. It could keep you a whole day, you know, your stomach. Again he inter...I started...now again he says, do you speak Romanian? No, this was later. A week later he asked me this. The week later he came. He was very de...it was now July. July "43. He said we had fulfilled our task. The large group had arrived. We had destroyed...the triangle went up in flame. I don't know how much. I can rely only what uh he told me, and he said uh...the second time when he he had asked me again uh would you like to join our group, I said sure, why not. , what did I have. Uh, but he had told me he doesn't like our hiding place. He has to find for us another hiding place and he really did. He found for us a hiding place again. It was a Ukrainian couple who apparently were very pro-Soviet and very...apparently who were not very well regarded by the Ukrainian Nationalist Organization because of some job they had had during the occupation of Galatia by the Russians, and apparently he was a contact of theirs and so on. Meantime...as soon...why, when I asked him why do you look so uh shattered, he said, oh we fought very hard. The Germans attacked us. As soon as they destroyed that triangle, the Germans brought a whole division, I think of Ukrainian SS. The Ukrainian formed I think two SS divisions and uh he says they destroyed everything. As a matter of fact he says our group is now in the mountains, in the Carpetian (ph) mountains.</p><p>They pushed us back and the higher and higher we go...and he says and I have a task for you.</p><p>Yes...meantime he had brought me also a gun. He had brought me a gun...a big twelve shooter. A Belgium FN. He called it FN enca (ph). FN stands for Fabrique Nationale, because I could read the inscription on this. It's a big gun. It has...it's a nine millimeter gun. It has a big uh twelve uh bullet magazine. It pulled my pants down, (laughter) you know, but a gun was something which uh...uh so by August he came back to us. Yes...we were meantime transferred to that couple. Again, we were in a barn, a much smaller but there was no...(long pause/blank in tape)...didn't have any more of that uh that uh uh contact with the nipping, with Anka, the previous hostess and uh they said...one day he came, he said next day I have your...meantime he had inquired about Romania, how well I know the northern part of Bukovina and so on and he said I'm going to be a courier to a person who is in Romania, in the northern part of Bukovina. He gave me the name. The name was, | think, Petre Hreniuk.</p><p>Petre Hreniuk. H - R - E- N-1I-U-K. Petre Hreniuk lived near the Zastavna (ph). Now my sister was the uh in charge of a pharmacy in Zastavna and I knew the area. I had...I knew the area from Czernowitz, how to travel to Zastavna, but I never had done from and Zastavna was not far from from uh the border. All those parts...you could reach it by uh walking. He said you have to meet Petre Hreniuk and uh try to to uh...he should hide fifty of our fighters. I said alright. You have to leave tomorrow. He told the couple, the woman of the...uh he went to the woman. She came over and he said you have to prepare for me uh food I should take from, for a week, ten days. He felt, he figured out...took me much longer because I did the biggest stupidity of my life while I was . It was...he told that he <span class="page-break" number="15"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 8 Poland and uh the General Government in the northern part of Bukovina. Meantime the Bukovina had nearly occupied by the Romanian and was a Romanian administration there.</p><p>I...there...the crossing of the Dniester was no problem. It was a drought. The Niestra was very uh very uh shallow and I am a swimmer. I...so it didn't uh affect. I came to Petre Hreniuk who...uh when I gave him uh...there was a uh a...I had to tell him who sent me, everything. Finally he he knew about it. I think somebody else might have told him because he knew about the group. The group had had uh uh parachuted near Tarnapol (ph), between Tarnapol and Chotkow (ph) near Skalat (ph). They had first, while they had parachuted they had immediately a a uh a run-in with the Ukrainian police which brought Germans from Borszczow, from Czortkow and from from uh , to help them fight. And this is how <span class="page-break" number="16"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 9 where I was born and to tell you the truth, when I saw the house, Marshall Fosh number 9, I I looked at it. I looked at it and yes...and on the way there I had seen a few people with the Juden star (ph). They didn't have what we had in Poland, that uh uh white band with the blue star. They had the yellow star here and uh I tried to pass, uh to keep a low profile as much as possible. While I was in my street I saw coming a former girlfriend of mine with a Romanian officer, arm in arm, and uh didn't even uh spent one look at me. I was dressed like a farmer. I recognized her. She didn't even look at me and then I decided I did enough stupidity coming in to the city and uh I still have to go back and...oh yes...what was very important, Vasia had told me my wife is going to stay in Poland. He said it's the...if I let Gusti go with you you'll never come back and he was right. And yes... had to leave my gun there. He said you cannot take the gun of course. It might uh, it might induce you to be, to start a fight or something not good. Better if you don't have a gun. And he was probably right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were your parents still alive at that time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No. My father and my sister, I found out later that they, you know, generally from the community of around a hundred thousand Jews, around eighty-five thousand were deported to Transnistria Moghilev and the centers in Transnistia. The area uh uh...Hitler gave the Romanian an area beyond the Dniester between the Dniester and the Bugr rivers, which the Romanians called Transnistria, where hey deported a few hundred thousand Jews and uh from Czernowitz they took eighty-five thousand. My sister was declared uh...eight uh fifteen thousand Jews remained in Czernowitz which were declared uh important for the economy of the city, as a former (ph) city, and she got a permit to remain in the city. She remained with my father. I didn't know who lived in the house. I didn't dare to go in not knowing who...it happens that my father and Melane (ph) stayed in that house where I was in front of that house looking at it. I didn't realize it. I didn't ask anybody. I tried to to to to sneak by and finally decided...oh yes...I had asked the, that couple with the horse who had brought me to Czernowitz when they returned and they said ah between two and three o'clock. I said do you have...but he said we have no watch. Neither did I. So I figured out more or less...I went back to what the Prut, toward the river where I fell asleep for a couple of hours because meantime it was only ten o'clock, and around twelve o'clock or twelve thirty I was back at the place where we had decided where we meet. They were already there waiting. They had sold what they had to sell, and they were wait...they were ready to leave even without me, but since I came earlier I still found them. We crossed the pontoon bridge again. Nobody asked any questions, and I...when I came back to north toward the border I decided to go back to Hreniuk and to rest a little bit for a day, which I did, and this time he was quite hostile. He wasn't very...he said what are you doing here? I told him I was in Czernowitz and he said you went to Czernowitz? Aren't you afraid? I didn't tell him how stupid I was doing it, but uh I couldn't resist. I had completely...it was an emotional reaction which I couldn't explain. Coming back to Poland I uh told him...I found him in terrible shape, terrible. He had a wound on his his...two feet...he had walked probably a lot. He said he's trying to make...he came to say goodbye to us. He left me the gun. He told me the order of the day, of General Kovpak is every soldier got fifty bullets. He says since I had a Belgium</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

He says you have twelve.</p><p>Remember - the order of the day is forty-nine bullets for the Germans, one for yourself.</p><p>Don't give up. That means for you it's only eleven for the Germans and one for you. I never got a chance to shoot it. But it uh...I mean to use it. He left me the gun, took...he embraced us both. He says I don't know if we'll ever see again. He was very...he was in terrible shape because he had to walk hundred plus kilometers. He told us that the front was now between Harkov and Kiev . Kiev...1 think Kiev was liberated already. It was between Kiev and Kamenets Podolski, and the Germans are retreating but he said keep a low profile. Watch out for the Ukrainian, for the Banderoski, he said for the Nationalistic organization. The time were...the winter of "43-44 was a hard winter. We stayed with that couple. We had terrible problems. Problems mostly of food. Food was a a major item. The people had...I don't know...the nearer the front came to us, the friendlier the woman was but the more hostile the man was. I don't know why. Uh we dec...we decided quite a few times to leave, but we didn't have a place where to hide. The area was hostile. The pop...population was hostile. So we stayed for them. Anyway when the...in in uh at the end of February the uh we saw already forerunners of the Red army and here our hosts suddenly got extremely friendly. They came out. They gave us a couple of new...for me a pair of new pants. They gave my wife a pair shoes. We took...uh say goodbye to them. They...and we started to make our way back toward Czernowitz. In the summer of "44 I decided to join the Polish army and uh I was brought by the Russian, uh one Russian to what Poland...where the front was now <span class="page-break" number="18"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 1 time to a uh a city by...small city by the name of Shedlitz.

There is no sign where it says where to go. There were no people there to ask where to go. Luck. Luck, again, again. Many times when I went to uh wrong I had to go back and go, you know, because it uh that part led me into a little community and we tried to stay away from communities. The population was hostile. You needed only one or two persons who were friendly, who were able to...or not able...willing.</p><p>99.9% luck. That if they caught us, there was no question. We had left our friends. Doctor Gabriel Zinreich still in Korolovka and they hoped, they felt that what I'm doing and Gusti is, has no chance. I knew that my chances were uh small, but my point of view was I'm going to try. At least try. To give in without trying, I wasn't going to do it. No. And uh as uh you know, it's the results which count and uh coming to this country, I tried, we tried to push that experience aside. Very very uh uh convinced that we...in order to grow roots in this country, we have to put our experience and not to think about it. Many things have to be accomplished. Very eagerly a family, and when we found...Gusti had seven pregnancies and she, in these seven pregnancies...she had no problem getting pregnant. She had problems carrying the baby. She...the first baby uh was six months, then five and a half months, four and a half months...but we are talking not about the times today where you have a well- equipped pre uh uh...a baby with a premature nursery. In that time they didn't have premature nursery. We had one baby alive in 1971, and the baby...the chief of the anesthesia department came to me and said Fred, we know your history. Uh you lost so many...uh the baby was two and a half pounds. It...a two and a half pound baby in that time...I recessitated the baby myself. As an anesthesiologist I am equipped to do it and it was a baby with a good sucking reflex and some and I wanted to keep...if I could have kept that baby even in my hospital, it was a hospital in Brooklyn, St. John's Street and, or St. John's Avenue, and uh it uh it may have survived. He convinced me to send the baby to Baby's hospital. He said this Presbyterian hospital, the finest hospital in New York, and there in order to to feed the baby they the baby. They put a tube and, but again, here we are in 1951. The tube was not uh...it was a polyethylene tube and in that time they may have been short of polyethylene tubes because they they uh uh sterilized it, by changing every second or third day, by boiling it. Polyethylene uh in that time when you boil it, it gets stiff like a board. And in their uh in their uh procedures they perforated the stomach of the baby, and while they were feeding the baby the the belly of the baby got bigger and bigger and one day I get a call from the chief resident. He was a Swedish uh resident. He said Dr. Bernard, we'll have to operate on the baby. I say why do you have to operate...it was five days later, or six days later. She said we took an x-ray. We put some uh some uh radio-opaque material, and we found the tube was not in the stomach but was in the abdominal cavity. That means you have a perforated stomach. They operated on the baby, and was a healthy, fighting baby, and uh but small, premature, and uh the baby survived surgery for two days and died of generalized . <span class="page-break" number="19"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 3 Tape #3</p><p> TECHNICAL CONVERSATION</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I would like to mention a uh an event which occurred to me in 1943, which really didn't make sense to me uh in that time but it came so spontaneous.
