March, we Start again, which we used to meet in Manhattan. Now, most live in Brooklyn so we meet here in Heights Congregation. We make a party once a while; we have our own cemetery and so on. That's almost every hometown has but a lot, like the youth, don't go in so they give up. Which I'm trying now to take in my kids to it. Of course we had friends; we played together, we went to school together, yes, yes. Other than Jewish friends, very little. I especially had a few because, as I said, we lived in a street, one side was Jews and one side was non- Jews. But mostly like the little towns, most of it populated from the Jews. Like the surroundings around, like the farmers and this, they lived around the town.</p><p>They called it in Jewish the shtetl. <span class="page-break" number="0"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection also. Because I know more the reality; I am more educated and so on and so on.</p><p>That time I was Jew 100%. Now I'm born Jew, I am Jew but I'm different. Not agreeing with everything -- so going, let's say it was the Christmas holiday, the last day of the holiday, the last day in school before the holiday. Then the action for two, three weeks. They came with strings and to the string attached weights, like a kilo weight, a half a kilo weight and that's the way. They knew that they were going out from the school. If it happened during the day, I go to the teacher and | put a report, something happens. Not too much, but something. But this time he knows in the afternoon, he's out from the school for three weeks -- kill that Jew, hit that Jew. So that's the way they were hitting. You came home bloodied, with blood, with faces like this. You killed our God! That was the only thing. That was Christmas time. It came ---.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It came before Easter, I remember, like today, when you went to school, how far was it? A mile? You went through the main street like they call it here Kasioska, there was the movie. As a matter of fact, from the movie was a Jew. At that time wasn't movies like today. There was outside all the pictures what the movie is.</p><p>The movie was calling G___. Now, why, it's not Polish, maybe it was ---. That was all the story when Christ raises and so on and so on.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: When you pass there, it's the same thing, it's the same thing. Anti-Semitism was very big. Let's say Saturday afternoon, we were juvenile boys, we went out for a walk in the main street. As I said, the whole shtetl was Jews. Around -- so Polaks when they came out. Unfortunately it happened to me this week <span class="page-break" number="1"></span></p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, anti-Semitism was very, very big. A Jew couldn't get too much of it. They say it is -- they say -- he couldn't get to a higher -- no. They felt it in the school, on the street; they felt it all over, all over. The Germans, they knew where to make the crematoriums. They didn't make too many in Czechoslovakia, different people. Same Catholics, different. But in Poland, all the crematoriums, all the camps were in Poland. I was in the camp in the beginning, near our hometown. I didn't have to run away. I could have walked away but where? You walk away and the Polak will give you for a kilo , for two pounds of sugar. If not for <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection family, two pounds of sugar, they did it.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can you tell me a little bit about when the Germans first got to your ---, when the war started and the Germans first come to your town?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, the war started September the 1". Naturally, as the war is, bombs with everything, whatever. I didn't understand too much. I didn't know too much.</p><p>Two weeks later, the Germans came into our hometown. It happened, it was the first, or the second day of Rosh Hashanah, the New Year's. Of course, we didn't believe it or not in the synagogue. It's not like the big town, every corner you had a synagogue. In the little towns, I don't know how it was in the big towns, the little town was a shul and a basm . That means one is the synagogue and one is like other than a synagogue. Let's say the synagogue every Saturday, the basm__ was for every day, day and night, even to go in for a whole night, if you were cold, to warm up. So it's Rosh Hashanah, New Year's. Before New Year's people like leaders grabbed the scrolls, the Torah, which you probably know, the scroll and they brought them. Let's say, this one brought to his house and around the neighbors, we prayed there. Was the first day or the second day of Rosh Hashanah, we heard, of course, shooting and this and that. A week before, it was bombs, which people got killed already, in front of me. One woman got killed -- I run out with a cover to cover her and so on. The second day they came in so naturally, we all start praying, we were afraid. After the Germans start to go around, nothing will happen, everything is quiet, we should go out on the street normal. About two, three days later started the feelings of the German. First they took -- in Polish they call it , hostages. Let's say this one is a rich one, they went into the magistrate, to the - and they got through the big Jews. They took this one, they took this one, they took this one. One they killed right away to show us what's all about it if we don't -- if we revolt against them or what. It started, they were there. Naturally -- and we didn't know. Now we know what the politics was between Stalin and Hitler. They made some kind of --.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Pact?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Pact. We didn't know that. All of a sudden, we hear the Russians are a couple of kilometers from our town. The next day they came in a patrol; with a tank and the school square where I went to school. We all around to look; everybody looked.</p><p>The Germans were laying down looking at the tank and so on. I didn't <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. Youth, mostly youth.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you think about doing that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's what I want to bring out. My grandmother, she was my mother, she brought me up. She ways to me, Avul that means my name, Avul run, run. I said how can I leave you. The grandfather was laying in bed paralyzed. He couldn't move, he couldn't talk. It was naturally, seven years already. The only one because he and me, we were in the town. But he was a businessman with his wife and children and I was near my grandmother. So nobody understood it, only me. For instance, they bombed before they came in. I took him on my back, as little as I was, and I dragged him to a cellar whatever.</p><p>He says I don't want to live no more. So nobody understood him, that's enough for me. My grandmother says, go run. I says, where I'm going to run? Leave you with the sick grandfather? No. Those days wasn't like today but I am today in this respect, I am today ess in this respect, no time old fashioned like.</p><p>I'm American, I'm modernized but in this respect, I don't want my pleasure I want my family to give . So I says no, that's all there is to it. After he run away with his wife and children to a village, people were running even before they came in. How could I, I wouldn't go nowhere. Then it started with the Germans. They were there -- people ran, people came back. Naturally youth people. I had friends, people came back; they got stuck. They couldn't go back, they went to concentration camps. They started, every day, you have to go work.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What kind of work were they making people do?</p></p></dialogue>

It was plenty snow; God gave us also plenty . Poland had also a pact <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection build a -- in German, they call it . What does it mean? That means gasolines, with oils, with everything towards the war. On the ground, they took us, we had to go every day from the house to work which the Judenrat -- probably you heard of the Judenrat -- they send you -- every day off to work. If you didn't go, they came for you with the Jewish police and they arrested you. Let's say if I didn't have a few days" work for me, I went out on the square there; you came along, you gave me ten zlotys, I work for you. First I look to who has. Every day I was at work. Whether voluntarily or not, being home, they going to catch me just the same. I needed a couple zlotys to make a living. In the meantime, you were at work, the Polaks brought in potatoes and all kinds of vegetables.</p></p></dialogue>

You worked there and we built a top that thing also. The rail was going and the by the Polaks and they did that. Enough so that half a year later, they started the war so everything was from us. The first station to send them the work. Then they make a hanger , it's a big -- airplanes, they started. We didn't make them but we fixed them and everything and so on. Like in 1943, was the first aus ____-- means to send away the people. They knocked it - - yes, before that, in spring, all of a sudden, that was 43, in the middle of the night, they came and says from Lublin to the Judenrat and they told them what they want them to do. We didn't know. They knocked at every door, every Jewish door, the Judenrat, the Jewish police, had to show them which is a Jewish home. They knocked on every door and they kicked them out on the square, on the school place there with Germans and Jewish police, Polish police around, to watch them who they took out. I lived in that house, as I said, on the other side was Polak. My grandfather died already. He died right in 40 which now, next month is the anniversary, 50 year, in 1940. He says 52. I, with the grandmother in our house. He lived at the end of the street with his in-laws. There was he and his wife, three children. There was a brother-in-law. He came back from Brussels in "38. Three years he couldn't stay, the war goes, he came back. When he came back from Marseille till German -- he had to go by train -- when he saw everything, he said, give me a little boat and I go back already. He saw everything.

I couldn't do it, I didn't know, I was a child. I said, Jetma, please let me go and see. Naturally it was going on like a stock market. Whoever gave money, got it. She didn't give money, I went to . She was running there and back. By four o'clock was a shooting and they took almost four kilometers to the station. They took them all to the station and from there they didn't know where. They started to find out, we find out where they are. They separate them into two camps. He was in a different camp, his brothers-in-law were in a different. It was near the Russian border which before the war was there. I would say, very big jails from the Polaks. They called it Ka .

They took us out on the market.</p><p>Everybody. What can you take with you? My grandmother she had to take -- whatever she took with her, how you call it when you die? A shroud, that's what she had with her because she wasn't as committed and that's what she had with her. They took us out and we're standing in the market; it's full. Here, over this goes on a stock market, a bazaar. The Judenrat, was sitting there an old swith beard, came over the Judenrat to him and they wanted to take him out. He said no. What, what nobody knew. After an hour or two standing in the market, five by five, five by five, to the railroad station which I mentioned is four kilometers.</p><p>We came to the railroad station and standing there by the railroad station and they start sorteering, sort-like. There was the arbeitzan, the guy from the labor department from the Germans. We called him -- by everyone and usually in the little town, you had a nickname. You didn't know very many except in school.</p><p>But in order for the Germans not to know what we are saying, so we call here such a chin, so we call him the __ which in Polish -- Jewish ----.

Every morning when you went to place yourself to go to work, first by the Judenrat, then by the arbeitzen the Germans and the Judenrat and they saw that you were there, you were there, you were here.

They callitthe _ from the Polaks. They took people on back but me with my grandmother till what, there was no. So we were walking. As we were walking the four kilometers, we found plenty dead people; all the people which we knew them very well. Probably they couldn't walk, they shoot them.</p><p>We go about three kilometers, almost our town. Our town was on hills but the main town was in a valley. But it was a lot of hill down. When you're standing on this side of the town, you could see the whole town until over the other hill.</p><p>We come and already they call it the w b , the wide mountain.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: June 4, June 21" I think, I remember it good because in our town, all the machinery, all the Germans, military and everything that the people said look at the road -- it's lower down almost a meter. Such a and everything. You never saw anything like it and it started the war. When it started the war, it stayed in our place where we worked, was a whole, everything to fixing. There came one soldier with 30, 40 tanks to repair. He begged us, he gave us to eat; slow down, nonsense, slow down, slow down. Because otherwise, as soon as it finished, have to go back. I don't want to go back. I want to stay with you there.</p><p>Every day in the morning we went to work. You walked like five, six kilometers every day and in the evening you came home. Sometimes they gave a truck, sometimes no. This went on in that place, this went on in that part and we all went to work till they didn't pay us. They didn't ask us where you make a living from and so on and so on. We did some military work especially the youth. A youth like me, they took me, they came in, that means , that means <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Our region. Trawniki pointed us to . There is a big story to tell about that. We wanted to go home already. There were partisans around in the big forest. We had a few incidents. All of a sudden there is a shooting and the bushes are burning. It's an unusual thing. We ran into the camp, there was no appell, nothing, that caused a panic. Every night when we came home, counting, an appell; somebody had to be punished or whatsoever. We read the story, good, good, he will forget. That SOB didn't forget. The next day, yeah, where is that swine that he ran away from me? Anyway, we were discussing, me and uncle and some friends around, if he calls you, no. We decided, if he calls you, first of all when he calls you, . Whatever he say, yessir, yessir, yessir. Don't say nothing else. I wanted to go for him. He says no, I go. He went out, stood like this, Jew swine, you dog. No, first he says, where were you? He says and we made up with that meister, with that German in case he asks to say the same thing. He gave him a deal, so you should say that I was calling you and you didn't hear him. In case they ask me, I will say the same thing. They were civilians from Yugoslav; they were like Germans, they brought them and they were our masters. We worked together and so on and so on. But they were on the free; they had living conditions and so we made up like this. When he went off and--- Where were you? So he said, you know the title. I'm sorry I didn't hear you, my master called me -- that means the meister -- he always had that machine carbine and a whip with end, a weight. You swine, he says, when I am calling you, nobody's g--d-- business, you have to come to me. Everybody was looking in his hands, what he's taking, either the machine, carbine or the whip. He took the whip. Give him like this over the head. that means disappear. He had here, after the war in Germany, when liberated, a German big doctor told him to remove it because that might take cancer. I have here also, you see?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What happened?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It happened like this. We were at work. The women and the children were like in the ghetto. The ghetto was around the synagogue. It wasn't fenced, you can call it a ghetto.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was there some sort of barrier? So you couldn't get out or---?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, you could get out but where could you go? If you go outside the ghetto, the Polak will catch you and bring you to the Gestapo. Then they going to shoot you because you did something wrong. So there were the children, the women and the non-working people. Otherwise, everybody was, whether in this place working; they were in three places working, which after that they were camps. Naturally, you ask me question, how did we live, from what? We had counts for provision.</p><p>One evening I come home from work -- yes, so they going to give Judenkarde, that means a "J". A J that means Juden. Whoever get the J card is legal. Who will get those J cards? My mother-in-law if I would have it, only a wife and thst's it. So whether it belonged to my grandmother, nowhere. We were hiding her, in a basement. We brought her down to eat, within the ghetto. One evening I come home for work, I says to my aunt, to uncle's wife, give me the soup, I'll go down to Grandmother and give it. She says I gave her already. What do you mean, you gave her. I want to go and see her. Don't go. I says no. Then she revealed to me, they took her away. All those that they didn't have the J-card, that means the work-card, they took them away. Where they took them away, there is a town, 20 kilometers, a little, little town. So they took them there. There is less publicity and from there the station four kilometers, and from there, it's gone. But in the same time, when they took them, something was with the partisans, a shooting and a lot in the middle of the road. What's the difference, this way or the other way, they got killed or something, bombing, gone. Now remains all the legalized people and all the working people and we are working. From Friday morning, it was Friday morning, yeah I think. Friday morning, that all those up that have the Jew card, they legalized; they have to go to the public bath. The public bath was a Jewish bath, for religious purposes, forv cleaning purposes, the bude, the bath.</p><p>The Jewish, they have to, it was for all kind of purposes. Usually it is a Friday.</p><p>was working because for the Saturday; all those people have to go that have the Jew card and clean themselves and so on and there they will get the real card and legalize.</p></p></dialogue>

Whoever didn't want to live no more, he went to the wire. Either the wire killed him or the guard killed him. The Ukrainians were the guards but beside the Ukrainians was the lagerfuhrer, the SS man, that Fiess and he has his helper and a few officers but they were with the guards. Those Ukrainian guards, they were not allowed to go in the camp. They were allowed their duty, not in the camp. You ask me a question, what did they have a business to go in the camp? there was a lot of business. For instance, you came home -- we had a stock market, as I told you, we had bargain of this. They didn't have too much to eat so they, from the guard, they came in, not all of them, whoever was duty-free and they was looking by us. Or sometimes, when we came in by the gate, counting so they can pull you out. In the boot, this they were allowed and to strip you and to look. Sometimes you find money also. Anything you were not allowed you could find, otherwise, we were not able to survive and so on and so on. In 1943, when it was the Warsaw uprising and the rest of the people, they brought to Treblinka. Why I mentioned this? it's a connection.</p><p>From Treblinka, 800 people, they brought to us, to Budzyn in that camp. Eight hundred people, well-dressed, they brought them to us, 800. When they brought them to us, so the Ukrainian I'm an old calhoon but those arte the new ones and they knew, the Germans didn't know so much as the Ukrainians, they knew that they have money and so on and so on. Going in from work, , that's a new one, a Ukrainian pulled him out, stripped him --they stripped once my uncle also. They came in, in the barracks. Once, if the lagerfuhrer, that Fiess or his helper, adjutant, came in and saw in the guard. And the guard said, this one, where are they? Right away you guard, you are not allowed to do that -- shoot him. So they were sleeping, those var people and this and that. Many came over to me, they say this all the time, I'm an honest guy and so on. Abie, do me a favor. Here's 5, 600 zlotys, hide them. Where did you hide them? At wotrk. If tomorrow you didn't go there, -- I had a young fellow, a Yugoslavian.</p><p>He was a year older than Iam. I remember his name, German, which he was my master, I worked for him. I had to . [had a hiding , he knew. I <span class="page-break" number="12"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection and that carbine, machine carbine looked like it. He's going already with the --.</p><p>Every morning he came in and he took us people, he rush them off from the barrack and running. Besides this, there wasn't those blocks, those blocks you saw. Was block 2, outside from the fence, right across the street. There was that block and in that block was a lazarett. It means a hospital. If you was sick, they took you there. It was like, it was -- in camp was tailor place, shoemaker place, it was for us. But in that block was for the SS. Some people were there and there was a lazarett also.
