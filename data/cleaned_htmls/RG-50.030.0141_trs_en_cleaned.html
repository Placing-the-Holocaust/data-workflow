<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Could you please tell me your name, where you were born, and when you were born?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My name is Sol Shaya Lurie. I was born in Kovno, Lithuania, 1930, April 11.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell me a little bit about your family, what your father did, what your mother did, your brothers?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Do you want to know before the war?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My father had his own business. We used to be in the lumber business. There were four brothers that were partners and my grandfather. My mother was a housewife, take care of the children and also to cook. I had three more brothers beside me. One was Menda (ph), Hiram (ph), Slima (ph). All boys, no girls.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you the youngest?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, I was the baby. My mother always wanted to have a girl. My father told me, but it didn't work out. What happened after the occupation in Germany, when the Germans came in the Ghetto, my mother became pregnant, and it was a girl but it aborted. She didn't want to have no children.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, you were fairly wealthy?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, well off considering. We had everything we needed. Life was good. The Jews and the Gentiles got along excellent, and we had workers by us and used to come to our house. They loved our family, and my grandfather, rest in peace, he was my idol. I worshipped that man.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell us about him?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: He lived with us. He didn't want to stay with anybody -- he had twelve children, and the only one he wanted to stay with was my mother. He loved my mother. I used to worship him. When he passed away he was 100 years old, and if you saw the man you thought he looked 60. He used to like to make . He used to drink with his workers, <span class="page-break" number="0"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did you do other things with your grandfather other than go to synagogue?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: lL used to go walking in the park with him. I didn't drink with him. That's one thing I didn't do. Wherever he went, I was like a little dog that followed him. Wherever he went, until before the war when he passed away. Once, he was going to visit his children in America. He had three sons and two daughters in America, and I wanted to go with him.</p><p>He said I can't take you alone. I got so mad with him that I didn't want to talk to him. But when he came back, I still loved him. Even to this day, the most thing I remember is my grandfather more than my mother and father. I have so many beautiful boyhood memories of him. I think he pulled me through the war. Whatever happened he just -- I think he watched over me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When did he die?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He died in 1939, just before the war broke out. I think he's still watching over me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you close with your brothers?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. The whole family was close, oh yeah. We used to go all over together. We used to go in the summer time, we used to go to the beach and we used to go on picnics. We had a nice summer home about seven kilometers away from Kovno. It was beautiful, a real beautiful life. Everything was so peaceful and quiet. There was no hatred between the Gentiles and the Jews, not that I noticed. I used to have Gentile friends. My brothers used to have Gentile friends. We used to play together. We used to ice skate together. We used to go swimming together, fishing, whatever. Life was beautiful.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You went to school?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes. I went to for about two years so when I start with the Jewish school I <span class="page-break" number="1"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: What happened in 1939?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In 1939 we heard that the war broke out in Poland and the Germans went into Poland and the Russians came into Lithuania took over the Baltic states. We were so happy the Russians came in because the Russian soldiers used to be stationed in the woods where we had our summer home there and we used to go there. We used to go over there and they used to give us they to a child was a big thing. We used to mingle <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> discriminate who they bombing. You see people -- as soon as you saw the planes coming, you jumped off the wagon went in the woods in the ditches. They came by and when you got up the person right next to me, shot dead. Some people were just blown apart from the bombs. After the planes left we got back on wagon and we kept on going.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you cry?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I never cried. And we came to a small town for the night to rest. We figure tomorrow morning, we'll continue. Meanwhile, we lost -- my father lost his brothers. We got separated when the planes were attacking, and we stopped in this little town. We slept over one of the synagogues there. When we got up the next morning, the Germans were passed us already. So, they said all the Jews have to stay here. They put guards in front of the synagogues. Nobody could walk out from synagogues. Even if you had to go to the bathroom, you know because those days there was no bathroom inside so most of them were outside so we had to make in pots and they wanted to get rid of it, and they just took whatever you made and just threw it right back into the synagogue. We were there for a couple of days, and then they said everybody has to go back where they came from.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was that like?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It wasn't pleasant because food we had in the wagon what we took, but we couldn't get out of the synagogue and you made human waste and everything was inside. We smelled terrible.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were people frightened? You weren't alone?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was with my parents, I didn't have no fear. Some people were afraid. Maybe I didn't understand that much. When you're younger you don't understand as much as when you're older, I guess. I understand now differently.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you notice other people being afraid or screaming or crying or were people getting together?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Some people were getting beat up. First of all, it wasn't from the Germans, a lot of Lithuanians, the Gentiles started. They were doing the beating up. They were taking away the things that you owned, and we knew something wasn't good already because the way they were treating us.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did that surprise you because you said you got along very well with your neighbor?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Sure we were surprised. You figured you didn't see the racism when the Germans weren't there. But as soon as the Germans came they changed completely. I wouldn't say all of them. I would say 95 percent changed. Some of them were beautiful. I mean, some were very nice. Even in the Ghetto they used to come over the fences and bring you food and <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> everything. So, I cannot use everybody, but most of them changed.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, you were in the synagogue for two days. then what happened?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Then they told us we go back to where we came from. So, we packed up and they gave us a horse and wagon back and we were going back to Kovno. The way we were going to go one way on this road and the Germans stopped us and he said don't go this way, he says.</p><p>Go where the troops are going and nobody is going to bother you. If you go this way, they're killing all the Jews and taking away everything you've got. So, my father listened, and we went to the German back to Kovno and we got there. We went <span class="page-break" number="4"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Before the Ghetto was formed, you were in Kovno for a couple of weeks?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, something like that. I don't know exactly, but a couple weeks until we went into Slobotka.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you able to get food?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, we had the maid, and also one of the workers who used to work for us, used to bring us some food and one of the maids that used to take care of us, her name was Naja.</p><p>She used to bring us some food.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: She was Gentile?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. Also, one of the workers. I remember he was a tall, big husky man, also used to love to drink. He loved our family, and he used to bring us food.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you see people being killed during this period of time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You saw a lot of people getting shot, but most of the shooting wasn't done by the Germans. Most of the shooting, the killing was done by the Gentiles, by the Lithuanians themselves, because they could confiscate everything you owned took away your property, took away your apartments, whatever you owned.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you saw that happen?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> AS Oh yes. Especially in the Ghetto, I saw a lot of it. one of the <span class="page-break" number="5"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, what's your first memory?</p><p> A Well, my father had two brothers there, in Slobotka, and also my mother had two brothers living there. We stayed with my mother's brothers. I remember good times, because you know you didn't realize because we had the freedom to run around. Nobody bothered you. You couldn't get out of the Ghetto, but nobody bothered you. You could walk on the sidewalks again. I remember my cousin had a bike and I was in Israel the last time and we were talking about it. He used to take his bike and ride around because the things we had we all confiscated. And life wasn't bad for me, but maybe because I was young. The older people were suffering, but when you are a child, especially a youngster, you get everything you want whatever was possible. Food we never had a problem.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In the Ghetto you had not problem?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, my father used to work for the Ghetto. He used to bring the food in to the Ghettos from the outside. The Ghetto always had food, even most of the people had food, used to do baking, always got flour. We used to bake, you know, bake the break, used to dry it out and make like a toast so it doesn't spoil so fast so that if you couldn't get no flour you had extra bread. I don't remember being hungry.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did your brothers work as well as your father?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, my brothers worked also where the food -- the side by the gate where I told you that's where the stables were. The only one that didn't work was me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What about your mother?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My mother didn't work, no. Most of the men worked. The women didn't work. And then little by little, you know, the first, -- I don't know how long it was, maybe one, two months after, the first action that they told everybody to report to this parade ground around there, and the Germans took certain people on one side and some other people go on the other side. I remember they told us to go on the left side, and we didn't know which was good, whether the left way was good or the right side was good. What happened, my father was working and when he came back into the Ghetto, he couldn't locate us, so he found out it was the action. So he went to the commandant of the Ghetto and he told him that he can't find his family, and the commandant from the Ghetto came and they found us and we were on the wrong side of the action, because people that were on the side that we were on, they went to the Ninth Fort, and everybody got shot.</p><p>Whoever went, nobody came back. My uncle, my father's youngest brother with his wife and two children was in that action. They died, also one of his sisters with her husband.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did your father try to get them out too?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He couldn't find them. There was so many, maybe 20,000 people were going inside. He <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> was happy, must finding us.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: This was a German?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, the German commandant. He came and he got us out. Because nobody knew which was good and which was bad until they started to transport you out.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you know after that that they were shooting at Ninth Fort?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yes we knew it. People were coming back, like the Gentiles, they said a lot of them were alive when they were shot. They were still alive and when they put the dirt over the graves, the ground was moving. After that we knew they were killing. They had Ninth Fort and they had another one, I think it was the Fifth Fort, but mostly killing was going on at the Ninth Fort.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So what did you start thinking then? Did you then get afraid?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was never afraid. I was never afraid. I never had no fear. No matter what happened. I remember one time they were taking all the children away from the parents and my father where the stables were, with the horses, we used to have a cellar there, so he took me and my cousin and the two children and my cousin and another kid and he put us in that cellar and he put wheat over the door, over the trap of the cellar so he figured the Germans weren't going to find us. What happened to my cousin, she had asthma and from the wheat, it started to affect her. She couldn't breath. So, what happened, she lifted up the cover, and the wheat was starting to fall inside, and then she was trying to close it up, and the wheat must have gotten stuck on the hole there and when the Germans came into the stable to see if anybody was hiding there in the straw, the wheat seeping into the hole.</p><p>They opened it up and they found us. We had to get out from the cellar and like somebody told me Sol, , it means run away. I started to run and I <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> father and my brothers thought I was dead already. I came back smelling beautiful. It took me days to purify me. They were happy to have me, even though I smelled. They were happy to have me. That went on and a couple of weeks later, my cousin and the two children, they all got killed. At the time they found us in the hole. Everybody that was hiding there was taken away.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Who told you to run?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My brother . Then another time, in another children's action, and they took me away and they put us in a stall to take us away to be killed and my brother</p><p> was delivering water there and he came in where they had those big wagons for water, it's like a tanker made out of wood. He got me out and put me in the tanker, in the water, and he took me out from the barracks and took me back home. He saved my life. First my brother saved my life, and then my brother</p><p> saved my life. There were always actions there and they were always taking away children. One time I remember they were looking for children, my mother, may she rest in peace, she hid me in the house, they had the big quilts made out of feathers and that's where she hid me. When the Germans passed by, they didn't find me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you under the quilts?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Under the quilts. Little by little most of the children were gone from the Ghetto. We used to have a big river there called the . That was the only thing that <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> 0 would never take me alive, nobody. I would fight. I knew people that went just like sheep, most of us. I guess we were taught that way. If somebody hates you, turn the other cheek. In the Jewish religion that's what we're told. We were told respect.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Sol, you kept running away?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's to save my life, but I didn't know how to fight. We weren't fighters. I only had one fight in my life and that's a long time before.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were your brothers in the resistance, in the underground?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, the only one that was in the underground was my cousin, my father's sister's son. He was the only one. There wasn't that many.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What do you remember about the Jewish police?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The ones were nice. Everybody gets a little power, and everybody wants to save his own life so what they do to somebody else as long as they could save their life. They had a little more power than everybody else and they thought that the Nazis would never do nothing to them because they are kopos. So, the people that they -- like the underground - - they used to take jewelry from the people and give it to the Germans just to save their own neck.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember seeing things that the Jewish police did?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The only thing I remember is my cousin being killed.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What did you see?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I didn't see him being killed, but my sister told me. They came into the house and just shot him. That was it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In your normal every day life did you ever see the police, did they ever shove the people or did you hear them say anything?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Even the actions, the Jewish police were involved in that. They used to walk with the Nazis. If they knew somebody from their family, they saved them. That's human nature, and they had that power and that's what happened. Most of the actions the Jewish police were involved with it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What about the Jewish council. Did you ever hear about Elkous?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I heard his name, but I didn't know what was going on. <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> 1</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Anybody else?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I told you, names I don't remember.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you play with other children? I mean, as they kept taking children away there were fewer and fewer children?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Sure we played. As they took away it got smaller and smaller. Ovariotomy there were separations, by the time they liquidated the Ghetto it was tiny, maybe six thousand Jews were left.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were there particular games you remember playing? I know you went on bicycle.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The children used to play football and soccer. That's most of the games we played. We used to go through the water in the summer time. We still could walk through the water.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You went swimming?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was there any kind of schooling?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No schooling. I know I didn't go to school at all.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you have books in your house?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We had some books. My uncle, should he rest in peace, he smuggled in some books, they used them on the outside that's because the whole family was involved in buying food in the Ghettos, so he smuggled in some books. So, I found a picture it was in Israel and I found a picture of my uncle smuggling in the books and he was distributing books to some kids and they didn't know who it was and me and my brother <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> 2</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: By the Germans?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: By the Germans. If you didn't look at them the right way, they used to beat you. I saw one child being torn away from the mother and just thrown right against the wall. When you're young, those things don't affect you so much. The only time that bothered me was my cousin, he got beaten up. I mean his hands were , he was bloody. That's the <span class="page-break" number="11"></span> 3 another one. Two families in two rooms. The kitchen we had outside. You had to go outside to cook. If you had wood you could cook. There wasn't much wood, if you didn't have any wood, you didn't cook.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, it was quite a different situation in Kovno?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We had a beautiful house. We even had a toilet inside the house those days, which was a big thing. We had running water, hot and cold water in the house, and we had about seven rooms. I was on the top floor, because nobody wanted to live on the ground floor because we used to have floods. There was the and the , the <span class="page-break" number="12"></span> 4 Somebody found out, they used to kill you for the piece of bread. Once I ate it, I knew nobody was going to take it away from me. As soon as I got it, it went into my stomach.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What did you sleep on in the apartment?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In the apartment, we had mattresses.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: On the floor?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> A No, we had a bed.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Everybody had a bed?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, I slept in my brothers. We had two beds. I slept with my brothers and my mother and father slept together. We had blankets, we had a because certain things <span class="page-break" number="13"></span> 5</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I want to ask you a question. When you jumped into the outhouse did you even think about what you were doing?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I didn't think what I was doing. I just wanted to save my life. I didn't know how deep it was. I just jumped right in there. I was lucky it wasn't full. It was the will of survival is unbelievable. You could go through is just mind boggling, the human being can endure if the will of survival is there. Even right now when I start to think what I went through in my life, I can't believe that I did it. I'm here to tell about it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: When were you 2 <span class="page-break" number="14"></span> 6</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you want to stay with your mother?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, I wanted to stay with them, but I couldn't. I was with my father and my brothers. My father had two brothers that were also there and their children. The women were left at and the men they took us to Landsberg, Loger A. They were there for <span class="page-break" number="15"></span> 7 completely undressed and he passed by and he looked at you. He walked over to me and he looked me up and down and he says to me, take a step forward. I said to myself, we're going to the crematorium. Then he walks a little further down in front of me and Marvin Shapiro, he lives in New York, too, he looks at him and he says take a step forward.</p><p>From the whole line, four of us, took a step forward. The rest that were left standing there, they took them away. We didn't know where they went. We found out they went to the crematorium. They all got killed. Me and the three more of us, they took us to Loger D. It was an experimental barrack. In the barrack that they put us in, it was an experimental barrack. We didn't know, but that was supposed to be a labor camp. And we were there -- the food they gave you a little slice of bread, a little water and that's it. Once in a while you got a little soup and that was it. I got very sick and when I felt I was burning up with fever so I went over to the water there and I washed myself with cold water and I said to myself, whatever will be will be and I laid down. I got up the next morning and it was like nothing happened. The fever went away and I felt beautiful. We were in that camp for about three weeks, four weeks and all of a sudden they walked in and they needed somebody for work on the farm for harvesting not far from the camp.</p><p>They took a couple of people from our barrack. They didn't take me because I was little, small. Somebody told me he says Sol put some straw in your shoes. You'll get a little taller, and that's what I did. I put some straw in my shoes and I got a little taller and all of a sudden a German walks in and says "We need one more," because one of them was sick. He wasn't healthy enough to go to work. He came in and he looked and looked and he took me. I got to work on the farm. I thank everything that is happening to me all the time I thank my grandfather, he was watching me. He still watches me. Everything that happening to me, he's still watching me.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We didn't know what was going on there. Nobody knew. All those things I found out after.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you didn't see anybody --?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, they were making lampshades from human skins. They were experimenting how to save the soldiers. They would take the people and experiment to see how they could save the soldiers" lives.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, you never saw anything?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, all those things I found out a little after. As a matter of fact, I got some pictures from where they made the lampshades. Somebody took pictures and I got one of them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did you know it was --?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: You looked at him. You could see his eyes. That little smile on his face. <span class="page-break" number="16"></span> 8</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did you know it was 2 <span class="page-break" number="16"></span> 9 Tape #2</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Talking about the crematorium you said you found out later on an explanation of why you got out of there, can you tell us?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: When we came, the first group of children and everybody, they went into the gas chambers. We were the next ones to go in. We were all undressed. We had the towels and soap. We were going to the showers. It was 12 o'clock and they said no showers today and they took us to Lager A in Birkenau. The next morning we got up and they put numbers on our arms. That's the way they identified you. You didn't have no names.</p><p>Everybody was a number. No names. A couple of days later, about 48 hours later, they told us to go outside everyone. We went in a line and one end of the camp to another.</p><p>And , | didn't know it was , but I found out later that it was</p><p> . They passed me by, they looked at me and they told me to take a step <span class="page-break" number="17"></span> 0 camp and wasn't used to working I guess because in Romania the one guy they weren't toughened up like we were already. He didn't run, and the German that was guarding us picked up a shovel and I got hit in my right arm and now I can't move my arm, for many, many years this caused it to happen. The shovel broke in pieces. I didn't even feel the pain. Now, my arm | can't straighten it up. I may have to go for surgery. From that camp they took us to the Loger -- it was going on a couple of weeks and we saw people coming in from the trains, gypsies, Romanian Jews, everybody is coming, they were burning -- they couldn't burn fast enough.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you outside where you saw the trains coming in?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yes, we were outside. While we were working there, the trains were coming in with the people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: During the day?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> A Yes, during the day. You worked a twelve, fourteen hour shift, well, from the morning until at night. They were going to the gas chambers. The crematorium was day and night, we saw the smoke coming out.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did you find out they were gas chambers?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You could smell the flesh, you could smell the burning. Especially when they burned them outside, when they used to pile up the bodies and the wood.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you ever see the piles of bodies?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, it was always away from the camp.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But somebody told you about it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, after this, the pictures were shown. You could see when they burned them the outside of the wood, the stench was so that you couldn't even breath. You could smell the human flesh being burned.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did anybody help you in Auschwitz Birkenau?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Did anybody help me? Well, when I went to work, no help actually, just self endurance to survive, the will to survive and also worked hard. They liked when you worked. When they took me to work on the farm, there was a German guard over there that used to watch us. The commandant from the camp wasn't around, officials, and he used to say sit down and take easy. He used to give us his food to eat.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: This was in Auschwitz Birkenau? <span class="page-break" number="18"></span> 1</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, that was when I was working the farm already. He was an older man. He said, that's my job I have to do what they say. If I'm not going to do it, they're going to kill me. The commandant came one day, he came -- they take me from the farm, I was in charge, and they liked the way I worked, and he gave me a job. He said I got a job for you. He put me where the gate and he said make sure -- because people used to come away from the farm, there used to be potatoes and vegetables and things like that. There was man on one side and women on the other side. They were Russians. There was a lot of Russian women were there and he says, make sure you don't let anybody bring in any food in the camp. I had to search them. I was a little kid. I used to stay by the gate and a little hut or whatever and I was supposed to search them. I never searched them. One Sunday morning they had an inspection and they came in and they found potatoes in the box and vegetables. What happened, they got everybody out that was in November, we got everybody out completely naked undressed. He made them crawl on the ground like snakes the whole day and the whole night. He comes over to me and he takes out his gun and I thought he was going to kill me already. He says to me "You're lucky that I like you, because you're a very good worker." He says, "Next time, make sure that nobody brings in any food in the camp, if not you're going to be done." Two days later, they started they took the women away from the camp. I was watching. I used to inspect. I was there until they started liquidating Birkenau.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How far away from Birkenau were you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I would say maybe five six miles, a big farm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you start checking people after this?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: lL used to watch, but you see by that time already the harvest wasn't there no more because everything was harvested already. What they used to do they used to bury the vegetables in the ground for the winter so they don't freeze.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you ever discover anybody stealing or smuggling in food?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What did you do?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I took it away but thank God it didn't last long because a week later we were finished already. We stayed in that camp until they started liquidating the camp.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How was your food supply?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The food, we got rations. If you had a potato, some people used to eat potato. If you worked on the farm, you took a potato. But the food you got your ration in the morning, <span class="page-break" number="19"></span> 2 bread and once in a while you saw a little soup and water, and that was it. You get used to it. Your body gets used to it. You eat it up and you learn to survive.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you still wear the uniform?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did everybody wear uniforms?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember different kinds of insignias they have, different triangles?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The only thing I had was a star, a yellow star with a black marking.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: A black mark?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, Jude, it said Jude because you had different nationalities. You had the Russians there, too.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did it have a J?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No it was marked Jude and they had a black marking an they had Russians there, Polish prisoners.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember what color?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I don't know what color. The only thing I looked was myself. I had to survive myself, nobody else. So that's who I looked out for, myself. The Russians started coming close to Birkenau. They got us together and we went on the death march.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you know when that was?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We walked for a couple of weeks, and people were walking and it was winter. It was in December, no food, no clothes. You wore the same clothes winter or summer. It didn't make no difference.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What shoes did you wear?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: What shoes? I had shoes with holes in them and the ones they gave me in Birkenau. That was the only thing I had. It was two sizes bigger than my foot, but that was it. I used to put straw into it so it made my size. We start to go on the death march for about I don't know how long. Day and night we walked and people used to die like flies. They used to shoot them right on the spot. As soon as you fell, that was the end of it. One night they <span class="page-break" number="20"></span> 3 put us in the barn, the first time in a couple of days that they put us in a barn to sleep. The next morning we got up everybody . There was a lot of people that couldn't make it. Whoever made it walked out. The ones that were left they burned the barn down with the people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How come you had so much strength?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't know. I still say my grandfather was watching me. Something was pushing me.</p><p>I'm sitting and I'm thinking and I still don't know how I survived this.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you ever want to give up?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Never. I always said to myself I want out of here. That is the only thing I had. That was the whole strength I had from that. No matter what they did to me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So where were you going on this death march?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We didn't know where we were going. Walking and walking for a couple of weeks we walked, without food, without water. Once in a while they gave you a little piece of bread. Finally we came to a place, I don't know what town it was, and they put us on trains, open freight cars. It wasn't freight cars anymore, they were like coal cars, dead winter. They packed you in like sardines and we were riding for a couple of weeks, without food, without water. You're packed in that freight car, I don't know how many were, but and somebody used to die you used to throw them right out so you'd have little more space in the car for yourself. The only water we used to drink was from snow. We took some snow and used to put it in your mouth. That's all the liquid you had. The train that I was in, if 20 people survived the journey, it was a lot. I don't know how many people there were. Finally we ended up in Buchenwald. Into Buchenwald we got out from the train, the SS with dogs, and they march us into the camp and they took different, -- the children they put them in different types of groups. Me, they put me in the Russian barracks there. They had French in there, they had American soldiers there.</p><p>Me, they put in the Russian barracks, me and my friend Marvin Shapiro. We stayed there for a couple months. I know we heard the war was getting closer. You could hear the bombardments. You could hear the shells exploding. They wanted the children. Take the children away. Most of the Jews they wanted to take from the camps anyway, and the Russians, they said that's it, no more, we're not giving anybody up and they said the Jews</p><p> . Nobody should go. We should start a resistance there and they took all <span class="page-break" number="21"></span> 4 We didn't have no water, no food, because they were going to get rid of us. My friend Marvin Shapiro got very sick. He got typhoid and they put him in an infirmary, hospital whatever it was. Meanwhile, April 11th I was going from Birkenau from the back from the parameters I saw a tank coming down the camp and the time was about quarter after three, and sure enough the Americans came and liberated us.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you scream?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no excitement whatsoever. People didn't have no strength to scream. People didn't eat. I understand the camp was supposed to be blown up at 4 o'clock. I didn't know myself, but people were saying. The commandant called from Weimer, how come you didn't blow the camp up. The answer, one of the Germans that was in the camp he said you come down and you do it because the Americans were there then. Everybody came running out you know, you mean we're liberated And the Americans came and the next day they started to cook food with meats and everything fatty and greasy things. And me, I was a child and somebody told me don't eat that stuff. The only thing I ate was a piece of bread. That's it, bread and potatoes. I wouldn't touch a piece of meat, soup or nothing.</p><p>People that were eating it got dysentery. They got that because the system wasn't used to food like that. They got dysentery, diarrhea. They were dying like flies. People were just dying like flies. Now, I still say my grandfather was watching over me. I mean I was so hungry and all that food in front of me as much as I wanted and the only thing I ate was bread and water. That was going on for about three or four days until I started to take a little meat. A couple days later they took us out to the camp and they took us to barracks where the German soldiers used to be. That's what they put us in. And we were there, with food, with freedom, we could go where we wanted to go. I went to Weimer and I didn't have no hatred. Whatever they did I still because my thought is if <span class="page-break" number="22"></span> 5 because they were without parents. Belgium, Holland, Sweden, France took children. 522 of use went to France and the funny thing, I forgot to tell you. I was liberated right on my birthday, April 11, 1945. It was a beautiful birthday present. We went to France. We stayed in a children's home over there. I went to school a little bit. What happened, my body was so unused to food that anything I ate I used to get poisoned. My body just reacted. I used to break out in boils all over my body. I used to have boils like my fists. It took two years almost until my body got used to food. One day we were supposed to go to Israel, 1945 and what happened, a couple days later before we were supposed to leave, somebody came from he American Red Cross and asked if anybody --- I'm going a little too far ahead of my self. A guy came into the home and he's asking names and he asking my name and I told him and he said did you have a father and three brothers. I said yes.</p><p>Your father's name is Simon? I said yes. He said well he was liberated in Dachau and they're staying in Landsberg. I was happy and going to the home I said they found my father and my brothers and I want to go to them and they said okay. They got me tickets on the train. I went on the train. I came to the German border and I met somebody. This is a little kid he said where are you going and I said I'm going to Landsberg to find out if my father is alive and my brothers. He said I just came from there. The whole family went back to Lithuania, Kovno. I said to myself I'm not going to go I don't know where to find them. I picked myself up and I went back. I went back to the children's home. And while I was there I was supposed to go to Israel and I was saying they came from the Red Cross and they asked if anybody has family in American, and I remember when my grandfather went to American and I knew had some children there and I remember New York, I said yes, I have uncles there and aunts and I remember New York and I gave them the last name because it was the same as mine and he said okay, we're going to put it in the paper any survivors of the Holocaust, and sure enough my cousin is reading the paper and she sees my name Sol Lurie is looking for in America and I <span class="page-break" number="23"></span> 6 my mother would have gone, she would have survived. I guess her time was up and that's it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Sol, tell us what happened to you after , what changed?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In 1987 I was like a piece of stone, I didn't want to talk about the war. I didn't want no questions asked about it. I couldn't show affection to my children. I was messed up pretty bad. So, I couldn't show affection. I was like a piece of stone. In 1987, I had to go in for open heart surgery, and after my open heart surgery, my whole personality changed. I guess I got another chance at life or got a new life and I became very sentimental, very soft. I started to show affection to my children. I started to show affection to my wife. I always loved my wife and my children, but I couldn't show because anything that you got close to in the war, you lost. So, I was afraid to show my affection, because God forbid I would lose them. My open surgery changed my whole personality. I became so affectionate with my kids, everybody. Even now when somebody says something, I watch a movie, | start to cry like a baby. Before it never bothered me. In 1992, my wife was diagnosed with cancer. They gave her three months to live, tops if she survived. She fought for eleven months, it was a miracle to survive. I guess I got a good chance to get close to her. I showed her how much I loved her. She knew it. I didn't leave her for a minute and she was terminally ill. She couldn't walk. She was in terrible agony. She started with 25 milligrams of morphine, she went up to 275 and that didn't help her. But I guess God wanted me to survive to show her how much I loved her. She was a fantastic human being, a terrific mother a beautiful wife. She was so sick and she didn't want to hurt her parents because her parents were still alive. Her father is 88 and her mother was 85. But the cancer and the will to survive is unbelievable. They gave her three months, and she fought for eleven months. She wouldn't give up. She denied that she had it. She said I'm going to be beat it. I got so affectionate to her. I got so close and she showed me her love which was unbelievable and she kept on fighting the cancer. She wanted to go to Florida with the cancer. She was getting radiation and chemotherapy. She wanted to go to Florida. She couldn't walk, we went to Florida in a wheel chair. The whole time she was in a wheel chair on pain killers, she was getting radiation in Florida, too, and chemotherapy in Florida. I guess my wife was looking out for me. She wanted me to be happy I guess. She fought an unbelievable battle and we have a friend of ours her husband passed away 2 1/2 years ago and my wife used to tell me I should call</p><p> , maybe she wants to go out with us. Her mother also had cancer and she said call and see if she wants to go to support group with us. And I didn't <span class="page-break" number="24"></span> 7</p><p> used to relieve her pain. I used to get up at night and I knew she was in pain, and I said you got any pain, she says no, I said I know you got pain. She said no I</p><p> don't want to bother you. And she went to doctor and she went to the last chemotherapy and she got so sick she was in the hospital and they gave her the chemotherapy and she got blisters in her mouth. She couldn't swallow. She couldn't even take a drink of water.</p><p>Her face was completely blown up, her lips, the flesh was showing. It was such a pity, and the doctor says there is nothing more I can do for you. So, she went to another doctor and she went to him and he said you want to hear the truth and she said yes I want to hear the truth. He said, there's nothing more I can do for you. We came home and she says to me, I don't want to live no more. That's it. And all of a sudden the pain got so bad I called the doctor and he raised the morphine from 75 to 175 two days later he raised it another 100 milligrams, 275 milligrams and I didn't want to give it to her, I didn't know what the morphine was going to do to her. She couldn't take the pain no more. I said let's put you in the hospital maybe they can help you. She says okay. I didn't even want to take her to the hospital because this way I fear that she thinks I'm throwing her away. I didn't want to take her to the hospital. I took her to the hospital and she stayed there a couple of days and the pain, she was getting injections of morphine close to 275 and she needed medication and she was getting patches and the hospital didn't have it and I had to buy my own medication for that, and in the morning I went to pick up and I said to her she didn't want to eat. I used to stay there from 8 o'clock in the morning until 2 o'clock in the morning. I wouldn't leave her for a minute. So at 8 o'clock I said why don't you eat something, she said I can't. I said have a chocolate chip cookie. She said okay I'll have a chocolate chip cookie if you promise me you're going to go home at 8 o'clock. I said okay. I gave her one chocolate chip cookie, then she took another one. I went home 9 o'clock and the drug store didn't open up until 9 o'clock in the morning and I got the medication for her I got it at 10 o'clock and she was waiting for me all of a sudden I walk in and they're working on her, oxygen, she couldn't breath and as soon as she saw me she stretched her arms out, her eyes bulged, she stretched her arms out to say good bye to me. She said Sol, Sol, I came over I said I'm here, everything is going to be okay.</p><p>As soon as I came she relaxed and they put the oxygen on her. I transferred her to a private room, and that was Friday she was supposed to go home. I was going to take her home because I got in touch with the hospice because she didn't want to die in the hospital and Friday morning I was supposed to take her home, and she died Thursday night. I arranged for the funeral and everything I made sure we passed the house when we are going to the cemetery, we stopped by the house. Before she died she was pushing me at that lady there and she knew I'll have somebody and she passed away and after she passed away for a couple months I was very confused. I didn't know what to do. I was lonely. I missed her. The first time I went to I was supposed to go to a <span class="page-break" number="25"></span> 8 only lives a couple blocks away from me and all of a sudden like it was pulling me, going for a walk I pass by house and I know somebody that lives across the street. I couldn't go into her house because it didn't look right and a man lives across the street from me and I know him and I always stopped to talk to her and my excuse was because I'm going for a walk that's why I stopped by. Well the thing was I wanted to see IT see her outside. About a week or so, one day she had a <span class="page-break" number="25"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
