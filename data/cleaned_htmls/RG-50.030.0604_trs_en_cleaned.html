<dialogue class=""><p> Wolff, conducted by Julia Danilina on October 17th of 2010 at the Kindertransport</p><p> Association conference in Arlington, Virginia. First of all, I would like to -- you to</p><p> introduce yourself. Tell me your first and last name, where you were born and when.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My name is Michael Wolff.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: First of all, let me thank you for taking the time to conduct this interview with us, and</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> I would like to return to your early years and I would like to ask you about your family</p><p> and about your town.

I was born in Breslau to -- to Arnold and Elsa Wolff, who lived in Reichenbach,</p><p> where my father had an interest in a sawmill. I was very young when I left Germany. I</p><p> don't have any recollection of the size of the town. The reason I was born in Breslau is</p><p> that my father did not like the clinic in Reichenbach so he sent my mother to Breslau, but</p><p> we actually lived in Reichenbach. As far as the town, I have no memories at all because I</p><p> was just -- I left just before my third birthday.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see. Did you have -- and do you have any brothers and sisters?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't have brothers and sisters. I'm an only child. As a matter of fact, when my</p><p> mother told her father that she was pregnant he was very annoyed with her.

Wolff 4</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So both of your parents were Jewish or just --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Both of my parents were Jewish. My father was born into an orthodox family. He was</p><p> the youngest of six, of Doctor Wilhelm (ph) Wolff and Hermenia (ph) Wolff. My mother</p><p> was -- was the youngest of two. She was born into the Frantz and Martha David family</p><p> in -- in Guben.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was their occupations by the time --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My father -- my mother worked in -- in my grandfather's store when she was young.</p><p> Her mother died when -- when she was only 13, and -- no, I'm sorry, 17, and she -- so she</p><p> worked in the store helping my grandfather. He had a general -- a small general store,</p><p> toys and, you know, home goods and that kind of thing. My father was set up by my</p><p> grandfather with a half interest in a sawmill in Reichenbach. He was the youngest, like I</p><p> said, and the rest of them, the older kids went to college, but by the time my father was</p><p> ready to go my grandfather was getting old so he just bought a business interest, half</p><p> interest in the business.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Would you describe your family as well off or middle class or, do you remember that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I would -- I don't remember much, but my -- my feeling is there -- they were</p><p> reasonably well off. I think middle class is probably appropriate. My mother worked as a</p><p> bookkeeper for quite a while until she got married, and I know she got pregnant pretty</p><p> quick after that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember if your parents were religious?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My father was born -- was raised orthodox, and he had a problem when one of his</p><p> favorite cousins married out of the religion. They sit Shiva for her, and -- which really The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

Wolff 5</p><p> annoyed him, so he left -- he had nothing to do with orthodoxy the rest of his life. We</p><p> were not extremely religious, but we -- he always celebrated the holidays. That's about</p><p> the extent of the -- of their religious activities for -- for various reasons. Shavuot was</p><p> never a big thing in our house, but the Passover was very big always, always had</p><p> Passover, and they always attended services for Yom Kippur and Rosh Hashanah, and we</p><p> did almost nothing for Hanukkah, so that was basically it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember that day when you were sent off as a Kindertransport child?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I don't.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You don't remember that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I don't, but I can tell you the story behind it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Sure.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Of course in -- in early 1939 my mother's best friend sent her daughter Eva to be taken</p><p> in by foster parents in Scotland, in Glasgow, Scotland, and my mother was unwilling to</p><p> let me go at that time. When -- by May she decided it was probably best if I go, so she</p><p> made arrangements for me to be adopted by the same family or by -- by a member of that</p><p> family in -- in -- also in Glasgow, Scotland.So in mid June, and I believe it's the 15th of</p><p> June, but I'm not totally certain, she went to Berlin with me, and since I was -- I was two</p><p> weeks short of my third birthday, she was allowed to go on the train to -- to the -- to the</p><p> ship. So as a matter of fact the story she tells is that they had to stop the train because</p><p> a -- the head count was one over. They had counted her as one of the children. So once</p><p> they got it straightened out we went to the -- shipboard, and she handed me over to one of</p><p> the older girls, you know, please take care of my child, and that's how I got onto the ship.</p><p>The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

Wolff 6</p><p> There were approximately 180. I don't know the name of the ship. She wouldn't -- it was</p><p> very, very difficult for her to talk about it. You know, it was really hard, and she had</p><p> handed me off on a ship. She thinks there were about 180 on it, and I was the youngest of</p><p> the -- the group.When we got to London, Liverpool station, she had arranged -- with her</p><p> usual thoroughness she had arranged for her -- one of her girlfriends who lived in London</p><p> to meet me there, and I met this lady much later on in life and she told me that, you</p><p> know, she was the only person in the London station speaking German, so I grabbed onto</p><p> her and I wouldn't let go. Now, the family that adopted me in Glasgow, Mr. and Mrs.</p><p> Ness, Mr. Ness came down to London in his car and picked me up, and she</p><p> actually -- this lady Elsa Weiss (ph), was her name, you know, made sure I got with him,</p><p> and we went to Glasgow.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And what are your first recollections of --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [remember the house in Glasgow. I don't remember anything about the trip, but I do</p><p> remember the house in Glasgow. You know, I remember at the end we were at a dead</p><p> end street. At the end of the street there was a hill, and across the hill was a railroad track,</p><p> and the trains would always fascinate me going by. I remember Mr. Ness very well. I</p><p> don't remember Mrs. Ness, and I don't remember Anita, their daughter, who was two</p><p> years older than I am, and I do remember him -- you know, they were very orthodox, and</p><p> he was -- he always put on his tefillin in the morning prayers, and I had my -- my building</p><p> blocks, my wooden building blocks, and I would tie those on standing next to him and I</p><p> would dove in with him, you know, kind of imitating him. That I remember.</p></p></dialogue>

Wolff a</p><p> the story?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The -- my -- my -- you know, I pieced it together from my father. My father had a</p><p> small prayer book, and inside that prayer book he has -- he took notes from this whole</p><p> thing, you know, of when he was arrested in Christinenthal (ph) and where he was and</p><p> when he got to England, so a lot of this stuff I pieced back from, you know, taking -- you</p><p> know, trying to get stuff out of my mother and from his notes in his prayer book, which I</p><p> still have.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, so your parents ended up also in England?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not really, but let me go through with that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Sure.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Okay. According to my father's records, he came to -- he came to England in August</p><p> of "39. My mother -- back in Germany she was, you know, taking care of her father,</p><p> who lived with her. She was -- took over the -- charge of the sawmill because the partner</p><p> was also arrested. My father was arrested. The partner was arrested in Christinenthal (ph).</p><p> They were sent to Doha (ph), and my mother had all this responsibility, so -- plus she was</p><p> trying to get him out of there, and if you had a visa to get out to anywhere you</p><p> could -- they would let you out, and, you know, a little money also under the table also</p><p> helped. So in August of 1939 he came over to England, but he was not allowed to land in</p><p> England per se. They kept him in what they called concentration camps at the time,</p><p> which were actually work camps. He was on the Isle of Man, and then he was on several</p><p> other ones during his stay. They kept moving him around. He -- he came to see me, and</p><p> this is what I get from his notes. He came to see me, and of course I wouldn't -- I didn't The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

Wolff 8 recognize him, and I denied that he was my father. He was trying to tell me he was my father. He came to visit me several times in Scotland. While this was going on my mother was applying for visas worldwide, anywhere that she could go, and the only place that would take her, the only visa she was able to get was in Bolivia, South America. So in early 1940 she left for Bolivia. Somehow they managed to keep in touch with each other constantly, and my father asked that she go through Italy and not through Holland because a lot of the ships out of Holland were being torpedoed. Well, she went through Holland, and not -- and not out of Italy, and irony would have it the ship out of Italy was sunk and the ship she was on, she made it to Bolivia. As soon as she got to Bolivia, she went to work for a Jewish lawyer, who happened to be the partner of a Bolivian senator, Dr. Bachnorsodo (ph), and through his help she got visas for my father and I to come and join her in Bolivia. We had -- Mr. Ness drove us down to Liverpool, and we had three hiccups so to speak. We got to Liverpool the first time and my father was late because they didn't release him on time, so we had to go back. We missed the boat. The second time they arrested my father because his papers were out of date, so we had to go back, and he was in jail, and then they finally got it straightened out. On the third time -- excuse me -- in late 1940, I think it was December 23rd, around there, we finally sailed for -- for South America. I remember very little about the crossing. I remember that I heard cannon fires, and I heard -- you know, we were on emergencies. I don't know if it was a drill or actually a boat sighting, but we -- we came through, and I remember a little bit of Bermuda. There was -- I remember very vividly there was a big ship model in -- ina window that I really wanted. You know, I was spoiled. I had a lot of toys in England, The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

Wolff 9 and, you know, my father, you know, he had basically two coins to rub together in his pocket, and it was -- there was a big tantrum. We went through the Panama Canal, went through -- you know, came down to Chile and to Bolivia, and I met this woman at the station in La Paz. You know, my mother hadn't seen me for a year and-a-half, and of course I didn't know her. You know, it was a strange woman. We -- we were very poor.</p><p>When my father had the sawmill back in Germany, he built a series of about 12 or 13 boxes in which they put all their -- their goods in, big wooden boxes, and we went -- we managed to get one of them to Bolivia, and it happened to be linens and bedding, and she kept selling the linens and bedding to keep us going. My father finally found a job, which was out of town, in a sawmill, run by a fellow Jew. My mother was working for this -- Doctor Breeker (ph) was his name, you know, as a -- as a secretary or something like that, so I was in -- I was in day school, and sometimes I would stay with the Breekers (ph) in the evening. I can remember very little about the day school, but I do remember that for lunch every day we had this fruit compote, and even at that age I would pick the raisins out of the compote because I never liked them, so just that's what I remember.</p><p>Eventually my father got job with a -- in a mining town, Potosi, which is very high up in the Andes, about 12, 14,000 feet up in the Andes, and so we moved to Potosi, and we stayed with -- the first place we stayed was with my mother's girlfriend from -- my mother's grammar school girlfriend. Her name was Erma (ph) Freed (ph), and they had an apartment. They let us stay there -- they had an extra bedroom -- until we got settled. Her and I were just -- you know, Erma was the total opposite of my mother. My mother was a very, very serious person, you know, very straight, and Erma was a total cutup, and we The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

Wolff 10 would, you know, call each other names and pick at each other, and you know, do tricks to each other constantly, and we did this -- as long as she was alive we did this. And then we moved into a -- our own apartment, which is kind of an interesting apartment. We had a bedroom, a dining room and a kitchen, a very large kitchen, and the bathroom was -- I always tell this to my grandkids because they don't believe me, but the bathroom was across the patio, and it was shared by -- by three or four apartments. It did not have running water. It did not have any lights, so I always traipsed across the patio with my bucket to flush, my little board to sit on and toilet paper, a candle and matches. You know, it was a big trick. We -- like I say, there was -- the only running water we had was in the kitchen, and we would take a bath once a week, you know, in a big tub just like the farmers used to do, and you know, the water had to be boiled and the water had to be filtered because it came to town in open channels. It was pretty primitive. And I went to school, and I went to grammar school, and of course I stood out like a sore thumb. There was about three or four of us gringos in the school, and the first -- my first year there I got -- during one recess | got tripped up and broke my arm, so my parents didn't want me there. So they moved me to a Catholic school, which was really -- really across the street from our house, and I wasn't treated very well there. They -- you know, they -- they didn't like Jews, you know. They made me go to services. I got to kneel. I got to cross myself. I probably knew more about the Catholism than I did about the Jewish religion, but I survived. Later on my father became a manager up in the mine, up in his section of the mine, and they gave us company housing, so we moved out to -- to a place called Chaco, which was outside of town, and it was kind of far out. While I was in town we -- I was The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

Wolff 11</p><p> going to Hebrew school once a week to learn a few -- a few things, but once we were out</p><p> of town that was impossible because we didn't have a car, but it was a nice home. We had</p><p> a really nice house, you know, compared to what we had before, and I went to</p><p> the -- the -- to the school, the company school, which had, I think, eight kids total, you</p><p> know, from all -- from first grade through -- through sixth, seventh -- sixth grade, so we</p><p> were in a company school. I started learning English again, which I had totally forgotten.</p><p> My mother always kidded me. She says when I first got to Bolivia I spoke Spanish,</p><p> English and German in one sentence until I -- you know, I lost the English and then</p><p> picked up Spanish and the German. So I went to school there until the sixth grade,</p><p> and then they sent me out of town to school in Aurora, which is a town approximately</p><p> 400 miles away, and I was at boarding school -- I was in boarding school and went to an</p><p> American school there. It was an Angelo-American school, which mainly teaches from</p><p> the states, retired teachers from the states, spinsters mainly, and I was bar mitzvahed</p><p> there in town, and I -- I learned my Hebrew for, you know, a month -- two months before,</p><p> and I forgot it two months afterwards, but it was -- it was interesting, the school. My</p><p> mother believed that -- you know, in Germany you wear short pants, so I had to wear</p><p> short pants. So my first year there I'm -- I'm taller than most kids, and I was -- I was</p><p> wearing short pants, and that was -- that was terrible. That was just a really bad year. The</p><p> second year I grew into long pants, and, you know, I was one of the older kids so we</p><p> were pulling the tricks that had been pulled on me on the younger kids, so that was a little</p><p> bit better. You know, as soon as we got to Bolivia my -- my parents applied for a visa to</p><p> come to the United States, and my father was actually Polish quota.

Wolff 12</p><p> Germany, but it became Poland after World War I, so they considered him Polish quota,</p><p> so we applied right away. Now, the whole time we were in Bolivia my parents and the</p><p> Ness family were corresponding with each other. They kept in touch. You know, my</p><p> parents kept -- you know, I don't know -- through the Elfbaugh (ph), which was the</p><p> publication for the German Jews basically, they kept -- I think it came out of New York.</p><p> I'm pretty sure it was. They kept -- you know, you could put ads in there, you know,</p><p> Arnold and Elsa Wolff from Reichenbach, Germany looking for their family and friends,</p><p> and they -- they got in contact with all my -- all my uncles on my father's side and my</p><p> aunt, and they -- they got in touch with a lot of their friends. So they -- they kept</p><p> in -- they were big writers. They always wrote letters and always kept in touch, and they</p><p> still corresponded with the Ness family so -- while this was going on. In March of "52 we</p><p> finally got okay to come, so we left Potosi and we went through Oruro to La Paz, which</p><p> was a beautiful city, and then eventually to Arica, where we boarded the ship to come to</p><p> the states. We came up the West Coast of South America to the Panama Canal, and the</p><p> first thing I saw -- actually Panama City was in United States territory. I saw first an</p><p> African-American speaking English, which just totally blew me away because in Bolivia,</p><p> you know, the Mestizos and the Indians only spoke Ketroamina (ph). They didn't even</p><p> speak Spanish, so that was a real surprise to me, and we flew to New Orleans and then to</p><p> Memphis, Tennessee, where my mother had a cousin, and they -- they actually vouched</p><p> for us, and that's how we got in. I went to high school there. Well, they put me back a</p><p> year because we got here in March. The -- the school year here was almost over, so they</p><p> put me back a grade, and they -- so I had to struggle with that.

I joined an AZA group, you know, the AZA group, leg of the B'nai</p><p> B'rith, and I met a lot of kids and a lot of friends. My father was having a hard time</p><p> with -- with the heat in Memphis. He had arthritis and it was bothering him a lot, and,</p><p> you know, jobs were hard to get, so my mother had another cousin in San Francisco, and</p><p> my father decided he was going to go to San Francisco, so he went ahead of us.</p><p> Sometime, I believe, in March or April of "53, went to San Francisco, found a job and</p><p> found -- found a place for us to stay with a Jewish -- a boarding -- like a board house type</p><p> of thing.

They</p><p> both had new jobs, and we really didn't have any money to -- to -- to spend on a trip. So</p><p> my parents, you know, were denied -- refused them, and they were very angry.

I lived in Concord, worked in Pittsburgh, and then I got drafted. What had happened is, I went to work for Pacific Gas Electric because of getting deferments from the Army and as soon as I got there they cut out the deferments so I got drafted. So I went to Fort Ord for, you know, three months for basic training, and then on the way to -- to Dugway, Utah, where I was going to be stationed, I picked up my wife in San Francisco and we went on, and it was -- it was kind of interesting. We got to this -- you know, we got to Salt Lake City on a Sunday morning, didn't know a sole, you know, found a soldier, and he was going up to Dugway, and so we got on here and we -- we drive out of Salt Lake City, and we drive for miles and miles and finally come to a little town, and all we could see was a snowbank because it had snowed for a while, and he said this is where you're going to live because there is no house on the post, and then we drive for another hour and we come to this gate in the middle of the desert, and, you know, what is this. We finally got to the main post, and sure enough I -- we couldn't get -- we couldn't get any on post housing, and we ended up in a little dinky basement apartment in town, and I had -- I had to commute back and forth, usually on the bus, and you had to get up at five in the morning and walk over to the bus.

So in -- in May of 1970 I went up to Santa</p><p> Barbara and stayed in a private home, just rented a bedroom and stayed there for -- for</p><p> three or four months until we found a house, and eventually my wife and the kids came</p><p> up and we settled in Santa Barbara.

This is Anita Ness, the daughter of the couple that adopted me, and</p><p> she -- he said okay, well, I'll do it, and I forgot about it. Three, four days later I get a</p><p> phone call.

Why haven't you called me? I said, I didn't know your name. You</p><p> got married. I didn't know your married name.

They were all older than I am, and I</p><p> was told how I used to bite Anita. I was told, you know, I had a purse and I used to hit</p><p> her with it, and the thing that really, really bothered me was that when I left her mother</p><p> lost her child, so her mother was really upset when I had left. And one thing we learned</p><p> just this year when we were back in London, from Anita, is that when I -- when my father</p><p> came to -- when Mr. Ness took me away, they had -- Anita was out of the house.</p><p> They -- they -- they took her someplace so she wouldn't see the departure, so she</p><p> wouldn't, you know, get sad at me leaving, and I just found that out this year. I didn't</p><p> know about that before. Anyway, we -- you know, like I say, we met the family, and I</p><p> was -- I was really unhappy that I, you know, caused that much pain to the mother. It just</p><p> never occurred to me. Why I don't know, and the night before we left for England my</p><p> mother had called me and she says find out what happened to Eva. That was a little girl</p><p> that went ahead of me in 1939, and I said, who is Eva? That's the first I ever heard about</p><p> it. So she told me. So I -- Eva was there in Glasgow at this -- this party. She was one of</p><p> the cousins. Her parents didn't make it through, so she -- she stayed there, and she is, you</p><p> know, the child of the family that adopted her. So that was -- that worked out very nice.</p><p> It was -- it was a pretty good reunion, and, you know -- you know, we keep in touch still</p><p> to this day, and I finally convinced Anita that -- to come to the states a couple years later.</p><p> So in 1995, scared to death to fly, just actually petrified of flying, she and Eva came, and</p><p> we -- you know, we went all over.

I couldn't get -- my mother, you know,</p><p> really wouldn't talk about it. She did get the Spielberg tapes, very, very reluctantly and</p><p> never watched them. She was just -- it was just too hard for her, but she did it because we</p><p> really pushed her. Mainly my wife pushed her, and so I finally cornered my mother. I</p><p> said, you know, you're the only living person that has met Eva's mother, and you have to</p><p> talk to her. So they finally went into a room. I don't know what happened, but hopefully</p><p> she told her something. So that's basically, you know, my story. I keep in touch with</p><p> Anita, and we went over for the Bar Mitzvah of her grandson in -- in "97 I believe it was,</p><p> and then we went over again in June of this year. We went to London. I took two of my</p><p> grandkids, an 18-year-old grandson and a 21-year-old granddaughter. We took them</p><p> there, and I made arrangements for Anita to come down to -- to visit us in -- in London,</p><p> and we went to the -- we went to the war -- to the Kindertransport Monument. We finally</p><p> found it. It took a while because nobody knows where it is. We found it and took a lot of</p><p> pictures there with the kids, and then Anita came down, and both her daughter and her</p><p> son live in London, although they don't speak to each other, so they came in separate</p><p> groups, and we sat down and we talked, and it was kind of interesting to see the reaction</p><p> of my grandkids.
