And uh part of Kovno that lay on the other side of the river Eleya was designated as a ghetto and all the Jews had to leave town by the 15th of August.</p><p>And I very much wanted to, to do some drawings of that exodus. but it was really dangerous to, to be in the streets.

If, if they knew people from, from whose windows you saw things that really some of these people uh for in- stance, Dr. Rabinovich is, is responsible for the raid on the potato field.
