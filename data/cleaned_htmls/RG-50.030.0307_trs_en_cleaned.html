Eli who was two years older than I was, he was more enterprising but for his own good. He was not part of -- he would try to help stabilize the family but we used to love each other and we used to fight each other and we used to do things that 13, 14 year old boys used to do. Abe on the other hand was much older that we were. He was older than I by ten years so he was more a serious person and he had very little in common with us other than try to take over the father figure, which he didn't succeed in many ways. In 1938, in 1939 things were getting worse in terms of what I recall there were quite a few refugees who would be coming from the western part of Poland especially those Jews who were exiled from Germany who came from Poland and somehow they didn't stay long enough in the western part of Poland and they kept on moving and settled down in our place in Louve. This was in "39 and it wasn't really that bad yet, yet they came the German Jews in thousands and settled down in Poland.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was born in 1925, October 29, 1925.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you work in the winery?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I did not. We had people who used to take care of that, but as I mentioned before our enterprise, or the winery, wasn't that much as busy I think in 1934 or 1935 so I didn't work. The only time I went to the cellar or to the winery is to see the process of making wine, how they were stirring the wine and to smell the wonderful smell that still persists in the winemakers. They were there, of course, I recall we had a winery that took space a whole block because that whole block used to belong to us. Underneath in the cellar under the whole block was the whole winery. I recall that barrels where the wine was stored for aging was stacked four or five barrels stacked high. They were smaller. They were not the 55 gallon barrels which is the common size here in the United States but I recall they were maybe 35 gallons. This was the standard barrel at that time to age honey wine. I don't recall how long they were aging but that smell and that wonderful aroma contributed from the honey it was still there. But in 1934 and 1935 we were all gone and I don't know who took over our business. It could have been that my uncles had took it over.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Very little. There's only one event that I recall about my father when I was four years old.</p><p>He had a beautiful flag, eight or nine rooms and each room was designated for a certain purpose. Beside the bedroom and the dining room we had what we used to call salon which is a large area and we had a special reception place for certain events or for our friends of the family. So, we had a fairly large flag. My grandfather who actually brought</p><p> The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

That was my family, the immediate family. Our immediate family consisted of our three brothers, my mother, my aunt Miriam and my grandfather. My grandfather brought me up. He was in a way a philosopher on his own. He was a self taught mathematician. He was a true philosopher.</p><p>Not only would he be reading philosophy books but he also was a scholar in his own mind with the tumult and all the laws of Jewish rights. He would get up in the morning four o'clock in the morning and he would be on his way to study in the synagogue. I knew that he would wake us up because he would be coughing. Whenever he woke up he would start coughing because he was a heavy smoker and when he left I didn't hear any coughing any more. So, he did traditional things with him. He would get up and go to our synagogue. We used to call it a . He would stay there until from four to seven, seven thirty and by that time he would come home and wake us up and go and prepare ourselves to go to school. My grandfather, he was very helpful. He actually prepared me for my bar mitzvah. He was very fluent in Hebrew and in German and of course other languages like Polish and Ukrainian. But his special language was Hebrew and German. By profession he was a printer. He came from which is south of Louve. He did have one sister I think and he had some family somewhere in Romania. I don't know that much about grandfather's side because I never met his sister, but I remember back in 1938 that somebody from which is from Romania, came to visit us and we knew then that there was a cousin from grandfather's side that they live in Romania. He had a good life what I recalled even though it was difficult from a national point of view, but it was close. We were one family. We had a good rapport and a good relationship with our uncles. The other brewery in that was right across our street so we had a major industrial park if you will of breweries.</p><p>It was the Isaac Brewery and there was the Brewery and then there was a Brewery and we were all together in it. It was good. I recall the way we were distributing our wine to different stores. We had a wagon and horses and we would be delivering wine so often. I used to like to go to the barn and every so often just to be together with the horses. So, the whole where we used to live, we used to live on which is a normal whole block that compares with any block in the United States, it was all one brewery. We were sort of like a corner house which was a three story corner house that borders on and " That was the main road in the Louve that carried on for a number of miles. The is sort of almost like a district, an area where Jews used to live. It was a dominant area for Jewish life. It had many synagogues. In all, the Jewish people used to congregate right there. I don't know how many thousands of families who are there, but there are basically, it was the majority in . The minority in that area were mostly Ukrainians and there was some Poles. There were more Ukrainians in our area than there were Poles. This is not to say that this was typical for -In our area it was typical. The main activity in was on Friday where all the peasants or all the farmers would come and sell their goods, produce mostly. We had a farmer that would come and deliver every Friday, sometimes Thursdays, but mostly Fridays, dairy and the milk and the butters and the produce. The potatoes for winter time.</p><p>The cabbages, all that stuff because was the main outlet for those <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> purchasing wine. It wasn't a trade off. It was just a matter you would be buying for a certain period of time. My mother would be purchasing from week to week produce, but for the groceries she would go to a special store where it would specialize in Jewish food.</p><p>It was a vibrant area for Jews to live. It was very interesting and when the market the farmer's market was over by Friday night, Friday evening as a matter of fact, you would see everything was depleted. The whole area was quiet because Friday night we would be going to synagogue, so the area was depleted. Saturday it was not as fortuitous but it was still kind of vibrant, mostly for the farmers who need to do some other shopping. So the whole weekend was vibrant and active when it came to Sunday, Sunday was much much quieter. Although the Jewish life continued. When the life in those days and I'm saying "38 and "39 was quite active it was also troublesome. Because we wouldn't be completely free of any problems. Any rumor that would install it would be quite dominant in our lives. The rumors were obviously of what happened in Germany and what happened in some other countries like in Romania or Russia although we knew very little of Russia but there were rumors, and he rumors were that Hitler was making statements that affected us automatically. There was a movement in Polish society to promote the anti-semitism. There was a part of that and anti-semitism was very dominant already in Louve and it was moving toward the end that we were worried. We didn't know whether we had to take any action. In fact we didn't take any action other than we had a way of saying let's wait and see what any troubles would be forthcoming. In 1939 it was a year that we will remember the rest of our lives because it's the year the war broke out. I don't remember other than I recall when the war broke out it was a time where the was bombarded. All the houses, one bomb hit our house. We were then in our basement, actually in the cellar was where the winery was, but we no longer had the winery but we had the cellar. A bomb hit just a part of our house, just a part of it, but it was -- the damage was done not directly to our houses in general, but the staircase, for example, which were concrete staircases, were they were marked and there were some splits in it, although we didn't think anything looked collapsed, but there was damage in it already. When we were in the cellar we had some other friends and some people were in the cellar and we felt we are in trouble when we got out and it was a while that I got out with Abe my older brother to see the damage. We didn't see any fire.</p><p>Nothing was really down other than one portion was hit and there were some other buildings that were attached to our house and we checked that and I remember my brother said well, there's not much damage to our hiding place. So, that I recall that we were hit by a bomb. Apparently it wasn't a large bomb, but from there on, that was the beginning of the war and in probably the next few days things had happened that Poland was divided into two major areas with the lights somewhere west of Louve and the Russians came in. This was a new era that we began. The Russians occupied the eastern part of and was part of that territory. I recall when the tanks were rolling down from coming from and they were huge, huge, I have never seen in my life huge tanks and apparently they didn't have to fight anyone because the Polish army was not in our immediate area. If they were they were somewhere else. So, there was no conquest to be bragged about. They kept on moving, and they occupied and our immediate lifestyle had not <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> new regime and so on. This was the Soviet territory. So that means that our house no longer belonged to us. And probably we did not have to pay any taxes any more because this was our main concern pervious, because my mother always had to come out with money for the loans we had incurred some years ago. So, that was a relief in a way. The big question was how do you make a living. My mother didn't see how her facial with the army showed that she was concerned about those things. Eli was basically two years older than I was. He wasn't much concerned about the family as much as he wanted to find himself, and he tried different approaches. He didn't feel like going to the gymnasium. He never cared for that. My older brother Abe was concerned because he was one of the intellegencias and there were rumors that the Russians are rounding up the intelligencias for reasons that I don't understand. They would put them in prison which was on -- I recall that prison being called . Whether they were arrested or not I'm not quite sure, but he was with us at home. During that period of time, 1939 and into 1940, 1941, there was a period that I don't recall too much about Abe as much as Eli. I continued to study. I continued to go to school, the gymnasium until that time. The subjects my studies were now basically new. First of all since Jewish -- this was a Jewish gymnasium, we were told that now we are going to be learning Yiddish language. That was a surprise. In addition to Yiddish language we also had Russian language along with the Polish language, along with the German language, which was okay. My mother also makes sure that she wanted me to learn the English language and the French language.</p><p>She used to, back in "39, she sent for me a special tutor for French and English. I was better in English than I was in French. That's how I picked up some of my English language. But in the Jewish gymnasium we picked up two more languages and I was quite proficient in Yiddish, although the Yiddish alphabet is the same as the Hebrew alphabet. You actually write in Yiddish the way you pronounce it. In the Russian language it was very similar to the Ukrainian language so I was also pretty much aware of that language, so we kept on going with our normal, normal studies with exception that we picked up two more languages. The life under the Russians don't have too many bad recollections other than that during that period of time more since Poland was divided into two areas, the German area which is the line, quite a few refugees were coming more so from the western part of Poland to our area. Of course the Germans occupied the western Poland so they were directly under the German authority. And Jews were fleeing from that area. I recall that in my class in we received at least three German students one was from , one was from Berlin, two were from Berlin and one from . And there was another fellow who was also a <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, they did not elaborate other than would I think would happen was the whole family escaped Germany to Poland so there were no problems with the family and they hardly spoke about any events that involved them. They were boys. They were my age. They were more interested in soccer games. They were more interested in learning the language, how to deal with us because we were actually and they were the Germans so we were basically -- they were not even of Jewish nature. We were Jews. We knew the Hebrew. We knew the laws. They were not that much involved. They didn't care about that. Not that we cared either because we were actually just a part of our lives.</p><p>We were not frightened to bring them into our way of life. They had their way of life. So, they did not mention anything of their event. The refugees who were coming in more and more from the western part, from Poland, we felt that we better slowly but surely being overwhelmed with those people and the reports that they brought from the western part of Poland was just bad. They were claiming that the concentration camps are being established. they were claiming that there's a terrible persecution going on. We thought in because we knew about persecution that persecution -- because we didn't have the same rights as the Poles of for that matter the Ukraine, but these were true persecutions they were telling us. We didn't understand what a concentration camp means. It was a hearsay and in fact you just didn't believe that. It wasn't a part that he would accept that, it just wasn't acceptable. We didn't know what people would do in concentration camp let alone the establishment and how do you so things people ignored that part. But as they were coming, more by thousands, the shed that we used to have at home, we have opened up, the salon and the special section room. We gave it up for them to dwell on it, to live in there. We had a large kitchen and we offered them everything we had. They stayed with us. Some of them took to work. Some of them moved out on their own, mostly they were not families, they were mostly single people men and women who came who escaped and tried a new life maybe it was temporary because they had left some other people back home wherever their home was. There was quite a few from , from Warsaw from -- I don't recall the small towns in the western part of Poland. So, they stayed with us for a number of months until one day, one night a knock at the door, we had a big house in . It was the Russians came in and they forced themselves into our place and they basically took all of these refugees. That was traveling maybe 1940 there was a time when there was a major gathering, a major expulsion of the refugees from to Russia. And we befriended some people there, so we were not far away from the main station. I run into that, and they put them in boxcars and a cattle trains, cars and they were locked up over there. That's how they were going to transport them from to east to Russia. We couldn't do anything about it. I knew they were crying, really crying. What did they do wrong?</p><p>These were Russians and this was the main event that I recall that the Russians did to the Jews. They didn't kill them, but they put them away. We found out later that they were sent to and to different parts of Russia. I never met them again. Life in continued after that expulsion until another war broke out and that was in 1941 and that was the time when the main when the Germans invaded . Can we stop for a second? <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> Tape #2</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: So when the Germans occupied there was a part that we didn't --when I saw we, I'm talking about the family. The family, my mother or my brothers and I was just a boy listening to what's happening, what surrounds us. We were concerned yet there wasn't much that we could have done even though that it would be an immediate danger. Our immediate danger would have been from the local people that we would be threatened by. As I mentioned before we lived in , which the majority of people were actually Jewish people, but also the minority were the Ukrainians and Poles. We were not quite sure how to take it, what really happened, although we heard a lot that the Germans are very threatening people. We soon found out that the first few weeks in Louve after the German occupation of Louve, there were quite a few robberies and personal insults and personal beatings of Jews by the Ukrainians. Some of them were maybe Ukrainians, some of them were maybe Polish, but it was very dangerous to go out.</p><p>It was very dangerous to walk on the street. Soon, we had a curfew that would not allow the Jews to walk after certain hours, evening. That was maybe just as good, but the problem that we actually had when it came to night, that was the time when the main robberies and the main assaults on Jewish families began. It was the night first 1:00, then 2:00, then 3:00 in the morning. They would rush into the house and if they couldn't find anything, they would destroy or maim people. Only during the night could you hear the night cries, the night help rescue, seeking help. This was horrible right during the night.</p><p>We, at home we were basically safe because on the first floor we had a tenant that used to live and apparently he was a . He was half German and half Polish, I think.</p><p>They occupied that level and they actually controlled the gate, not that he would help us directly but people know that somebody's -- Snyder I think was his name, he lived in that house, so we were basically protected. But you could hear at night the horrible screams being robbed and maimed and so on. It was a very bad period, but it wasn't getting better because every week there would be new regulations and new instructions and at one point and I don't recall exactly the month, we got instructions that we had to vacate the premises, the homes, where we used to live, and move into a small ghetto that was</p><p> . To find a dwelling and to move out, and we didn't have that much <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> our home. Not quite sure what he was doing. I'm sure he was trying to survive, trying to find some angles to get out of a bad situation. We moved out to that small ghetto. A secretary to our business who used to be our secretary, she used to live in that area, in that small ghetto in a free standing home and she offered her house to my mother. I don't know the deal that she made with my mother but at least we were secure that we had a house to go to and that was a relief because at that time it was very difficult to get an area because you're talking many thousands of people had to move out of one area to another area where you have a comparable exchange of dwellings. It wa questionable, but we had it. With our house in that free standing house and I recall there were maybe three rooms perhaps and there was another family that moved in with us. Now, it was a period of time that we acclimated ourselves into this new ghetto. The faces that we didn't know before all of a sudden we knew them very well. They were all Jews. The way I understand that a Jewish police was formed who supposed to bring law and order in the ghetto and our ghetto. We were not much concerned with them, other than there was another area that we were quite ambivalent that we did not know what that all means to us. We all of a sudden have a new life in a new ghetto, new people, new surroundings.</p><p>The future, who knows what it's going to bring. The rumors were actually in that ghetto that those people who work will be much better off if they don't work, meaning that you better have a place to work and then you'll be getting some kind of identification card that will help you survive. Survival really didn't mean too much to us other than it came to the point where you had to survive somehow not knowing of camps or anything of that that we are immediately placed in jeopardy of our lives. That didn't grasp yet. We weren't involved in that. We were involved mostly in our personal belonging, in our personal lifestyle and being attacked by hoodlums because you are a Jew you are no longer a human being. The ghetto didn't mean to us that this was the end of our line. It was perhaps the end of persecution by the Ukrainians. You were not directly confronted with the physical abuse, the physical maiming of people. The rumors were you better get work. That was in "41. I was 16 years old, and I wasn't -- didn't know where to find work.</p><p>Where do you find work in ghetto and I run across a friend of mine who told me that there is a place on Street who -- and they called it that they're looking for some workers, but he felt that I wouldn't be strong enough. I didn't know what the work consisted of, but anyway it was something to look into. I went back to my mother and told her that there is a place that I was told that they're looking for some workers and whether she would allow me to go interview. My mother didn't think that she objected other than she warned me be careful. I went there. I went to . They called it later on . isa <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> he says yes I can only if he can carry that ball. He took me out and tested me out, and he selected the largest ball, 75 kilos. Every ball was numbered and I picked it up and I carried it and I dropped it the place where he wanted me to drop it and he hired me on the spot. You can work with us. It was basically not a relief for me other than that I felt that I'm employable. I went back home told my mom that I have a job and maybe we'll be more secure. From there on it was very little things I recall other than I was working every day with them going back from ghetto to or .</p><p>It's maybe a 20 minute walk, maybe 30 minutes. So, at that time, I was going back and forth and my mother all day long I would be working and evening I would be coming home. At the same time I was able to purchase some produce at the place I used to work, like tomatoes and maybe bread although we could buy some bread but we were rationed in ghetto. So, it was helpful. I don't recall at what point they have established living quarters in . It was some time later than -- I'm trying to recall something which I'm not quite at ease with me. Let me say the time sometime in August of 19-- it was in "42 already. I did work a number of months. It seems to me going back from ghetto to and here I'm blank a certain period of time that I <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0 tell whether that couch was separate for anyone else it was one part. The frame and the couch, the upper part was one unit. That's why when there was any action, my mother would be hiding there. I would make sure of that. When I got home, the upper part was moved so I was scared of that. When I cried out for my mother she came to life. She was there. She was on the inside of the couch so even it was moved, she was in that area. She was wrapped around in a blanket, a dark blanket. So even though they were looking for her, they didn't find her. She was there, so we had our moment, with my mother. A number of weeks went by before another action came about. I think during that action I lost my mother, and I don't know how they got her. So, she was gone. Eli was gone, Abe was gone. It was a part of that they have then decided to establish a living quarters, I think, on the premises of . <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 1 to impress and I wanted his assurance. Abe was a little bit on the snobbish side because he was always with his friends talking about zionism, talking about the world's affairs.</p><p>He tried to settle all the world's affairs. Eli was completely different from both of us. He was more or like a happy go lucky fellow. He wanted to live now not tomorrow. Now is the day. Since he didn't have that much, he would take certain things from home and sell it to satisfy his needs, and I was fighting with him. I wasn't angry with him, but I tried to preserve things that the family had. He understood that very well, but he was my favorite brother because maybe we were fighting all the time and we loved each other and he used to give me some secrets and at night he used to take me outside the house and we would be smoking. So, I kept things in secret. He was very good natured, though. He cared about us. Now, Eli was taken away from us some time. I really don't know when. He was taken away from that small ghetto. Now I heard that Eli was in concentration camp in</p><p> . We weren't sure that this was a death camp, but it was very <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 2 some sand to the factory. His name was . And he selected me to be his helper to care for the horses and so on. I really enjoyed that. I'd rather work with horses than work in the factory. The foreman of the factory liked also bunnies, rabbits. He had a cage of rabbits in the stall in the barn and he asked me to take care of them. So, I had the horses now and I had the rabbits and I used to take care of them. It was pleasant. I liked to work with animals and at the same time I was the helper of . Lused to call him . He was a very nice fellow. A very straightforward fellow. He was Ukrainian. He did not see me as a Jew. I was Wilek to him and he was to me. I didn't care that he was Ukrainian even though that I knew that the Ukrainians killed Jews and abused Jews and vice versa. He saw me as Wilek, a fellow. So, he was very nice to me, he was human. We liked each other. So, I was his assistant in doing anything that the factory needed, to take care of. Caring for the animals but also transporting asphalt. This was going on for a number of months. Now, I had an opportunity to go out of the factory with him and see what was going on. Now, when I drove with him on the wagon, I did not have a band, I don't think so because I was part of the</p><p> . So, we used to drive oh maybe a kilometer or so to get the <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 3 Tape #3</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So we used to bring the asphalt back to the factory and of course in the process of asphalt being liquified later on in huge ovens and that's how we get the process of that tar onto the paper. That was my work in , working with day in and day out. We were able to drive from our factory to maybe two or three different streets, and of course at that time Louve, that area any way, was already Jew free. There were no Jews there anymore. Perhaps some were hidden, but there were no visible Jews.</p><p>The place was basically very quiet. It wasn't vibrant as it used to be the times that I recall back in "38 and "39. We were doing this a number of months and Peter and I we were very much befriended. We were talking about at times that it could happen that one of these days they will take me away. The discussion was how do I survive. How do I get out of this place. I did not have good moves ahead of me. I did not see too many visions, what is a good way of doing it. In back of our factory there were tracks and those tracks you could see every so often Hungarian troops going somewhere and the thought that came to my mind, wouldn't it be nice if I knew some Hungarian language and just jumped in the cart and said hey, I'm one of you. But it was just a dream. Back with Peter, I told Peter what's a good way of surviving. He didn't give me a good answer. One day he came and told me, you know Wilek, if I could hide you I would do that, but I can't trust my wife. I thanked him for the offer or his thoughts. We had a farmer that would deliver some produce over a number of years and he was a very good friend of ours. He looked me up in , and he told me that if you need a place come to us. So, in that <span class="page-break" number="11"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 4 getting closer and closer of annihilation of the Jewish population in Louve. We knew about Warsaw and we knew they were fighting. We also knew that the downtown ghetto is getting tighter and tighter. Very few Jews you could see being escorted on the street, less and less because until that time you see a group escorted by the militia. People from ghetto to work from work back to ghetto. Of course we were stationary. The group of the 40 Jews. We were stationary. We live right then and but we see them once in a while and sometimes I saw on my wagon these groups going back and forth. I mentioned before this slaughter house and there was one Jew who used to work there and as we were cutting the asphalt and that Jew across the field would look and wave to me and I would go there talk to him and ask him what his business was while he goes back and forth from the slaughter house back to ghetto. But at the same time, he offered me some meat to take it with me so I would bring that meat back home. Home meaning my people. I would bring that. Occasionally I would be going from to ghetto just to go there. I didn't have anyone there. Maybe I would be going with a friend of mine because he wanted to accompany, but I recall everytime I would be going there, I wouldn't be going there too often, but I was given an armband with a W letter which was for meaning that we were working for the , the army, even though that manager of our factory was a captain in air force which doesn't make sense but that's the way it was. He apparently was very good, very good. A reasonable human being. He had an excellent rapport with Fessel. He was I think captain in the air force. He was the one who would warn us when major problems occurred. At one point, he would warn us that we were about to be picked up by the guards. We would move out. The way I dressed myself -- I was dressed myself as a typical farmer. This is the way I could disguise myself the best, with long boots, with special boot type slacks. They're specially curved that the boot accepts the slacks and with a hat and a cigarette in my mouth. I used to roll my own cigarettes so I was a typical farmer. The first time that we were going to be picked up I just left. I had no where to go. Ghetto was opened. You could go in to ghetto but who wants to go into ghetto. So I went downtown on Street where I used to go with friends of mine and prominent the area when we used to be young boys and free of troubles. It was like three or four o'clock or two o'clock, something right afternoon that I ran off from and there was very little <span class="page-break" number="12"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 5 did not feel so crowded in my life because that was the first time I was exposed to that. In other words, living in in my own bunk in the basement with only 40 <span class="page-break" number="12"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 6</p><p> and Horowitz they were all dressed up. They're ready to move out. They were not moving yet, but they were ready to move out. I didn't even try to look down in the basement what is going on regardless even though you have a hiding place, I wasn't about to stay there. I decided to go, to move because I didn't see any future in hiding in that place. Sooner or later, probably sooner than later we were going to be discovered, so I didn't take this place as a safe one. My point was is to get out. The question when, that is within an hour or so. I went to Peter. I said goodbye to him and I moved out. That was the last time I saw Peter. He wished me luck and I went out. I kept on walking. I don't remember all the streets that I went through, I just followed certain streets and I went through a place a main thorough and right on the street a friend of mine, well, not a friend but an acquaintance. A fellow I went to school with, to public school, Sayer his name was and he saw me. He looks at me. Of course he knew that I'm Jewish and I look at him my question is is he going to betray me. I didn't think so. He grabbed me and we went to a gate, to a house and I told him I need your help. What do you need? I said I need you to be here at a certain time, about three o'clock. I don't know what time it was then but there was plenty of time. I thought I'd need him to go to the station to get my ticket because I had my farmer in mind. But I was on my way to that lady. Just in case I didn't get any results there, I'd have a chance to go there and I needed him to help me out to buy a ticket, a train ticket. I wasn't sure how to buy it. I wasn't sure that part how to buy the ticket, but besides I needed his help anyway if he could offer me or at least not to betray me. He said I'll be here at 3:00. What else do you need. I told him I didn't need anything other than to help me to go through that period of that hour or two. I kept on walking. I didn't think that I would be betrayed by Sawyer. I didn't think so even though he was Ukrainian. So, I kept on walking and I went to that place. At first I didn't recognize the house because he described me a certain house but when I looked at those houses, they all looked the same. Across the field there was barracks where the Ukrainian militia used to live. There was an area where I felt well, you do or you don't. I went to one house and I asked -- her name was Maria, and I knocked at the door, is Maria home? The person says no Maria here. I'm sorry. Then I went to another door. It must have been one of those houses so I went to another house. The next time and she opens the door. Maria was there. Now, Maria doesn't know me. I know Maria. She was limping. She was a good looking lady, probably 25 to 28, Polish. I asked her that I'd liked to see Mr. Fessel. She says no Fessel in this house. I said well, probably not but please tell him that one of his workers is here. She says no Fessel is not here. I said okay. I took off. Maybe I was misled. I took this as a true sign I was misled my next option is to go to my farmer. I kept on tracing my steps back, the same way and I was going to see Sawyer. As I walked down I'd say a good half a mile down the road, I hear some hollering behind me. It was Maria with her limping legs was after me. She was hollering for me to stop. I finally stopped and went back, kept on walking towards her and she looked at me. You're so stupid and some other expletives. Come back with me. And probably I was stupid and she took me back and walked me right into this room in this house where Fessel was.</p><p>Now, my first impression was grim faces because they were not sure how I got that name, how I got the address because if I could find them someone else could find them.</p><p>Obviously true, Peter could find them. This was their main concern. They weren't concerned about me but about Peter. Peter as far as I have never seen him drunk. And Peter he was such a friend that he would never betray me. So there was no concern. I</p><p> The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

The group consisted of Fessel and his brother. His brother was a tall, very heavy set fellow who impersonated a German captain. He had a German overcoat and a German hat, but when I saw him, he was just Fessel, an obese fellow. It was Fessel, his brother, his lady friend, two other people who I don't know how they got in there probably through a different route, but the route that I know how Fessel got into this house was Fessel his brother, and another worker, I think Kline, who used to be his personal secretary in . So at least two people from our factory, his brother which I never saw him before, his lady friend. That lady friend was a sister of that other couple, that was already there apparently and another fellow that I don't know how he came about there. Maybe he was completely independent but he was a lover of Maria. So we had like seven people there. I think there was seven, I was the eighth one. It was a time where they were concerned about their security because of Peter. The question was whether or not they should send me back, back to Peter's place home and tell him no one was there. So, I could go and apparently go back home to their place to secure their hiding place. It was stupid and it was very inconsiderate and but because they would put me in a double jeopardy really, because it was very difficult to travel, walk that number of miles to his place. They finally decided not to do that because they felt that Peter was more of a friend of mine than of theirs. They left it at that. So, now I was not one of them, but at least I was in a safe place for the time being. The area we were in one room I think maybe it was another room, but basically I was in the front in the large room that was together with this hiding family. We had a trap door to the basement which was not in the walking place but in a crawling space. We had a special area that was covered with a rock in case something happens we all go inside and hide ourself there. We had our food.</p><p>Apparently Fessel had enough money to supply for our existence there and apparently paying also Maria. I'm sure nothing went free because she demanded some money. I didn't have any money so she couldn't get anything out of me, and she never asked either.</p><p>So, I thought things were taken care of by Fessel. The other couple they also were from Louve, I forget their name and that really irritates me that I don't remember those names because they're very important people because even though you're hiding and you're sort of in a group relationship, you were strangers. Maybe you had one thing in common, we are all Jews and we want to survive. There was one thing in common but different interests in different projections in their lives, that was another thing. So, the dynamics of our group was strange, but I could listen to their conversations. I could take part of some of them, but Fessel was the dominant fellow who would set the tone of this group. There was a point in time the ghetto was liquidated already and now there were rumors that the concentration camp is being liquidated. The rumors were also that the <span class="page-break" number="14"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 8 weren't even talking about Hungary at that time at all. The question was they're going to be moving out, should they take me with them. I confronted that part with Fessel and I told Fessel that although it wasn't his obligation towards me at all but I asked them that I would like to be with them. I could always stay here, but I want to get out of Louve in general. This is a horrible place. I don't want to be here, even in hiding. He said well, we'll have to see what our resources are. We'll have to see if we can give you some papers. He apparently was good enough to do that for me. I was told that their plan is to escape ultimately to Hungary from Louve to from to</p><p> Mountains, through Slovakia to Hungary. That's the plan. I walked with</p><p> them all the way. I'll go with you anyplace you go. I felt that I could be of help to them if they needed me. The time came sometime in the early part of December I think, maybe it was in December, that we got our papers, the Gentile papers with our photographs and the stamps and the my name was . I took the name of an <span class="page-break" number="15"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 9 Tape #4</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you have any idea why Maria would want to save Jews or at least save this group?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I'm not quite sure. I never asked her. The only thing that I could stipulate was that she was prearranged prior to that. The fact that I saw her one day in a factory walking towards the office that means she was prearranged. She was given I'm almost sure that she was paid, handsomely paid, by Mr. Fessel. I know other things that during my stay in the hiding would be that her father would be visiting her one day in the week and that was the day that they used to play similar cards to poker and he would be playing with Fessel and Kline and Joseph evenings and it was make sure that her father would always be the winner on that evening. He may be losing a little bit, but in the end when the game was over, he would be coming out with money. He knew about us obviously, so he was paid that way through winning in this game. Other than that, I don't have any other facts, but Maria a person of no wealth. She had this house and she was with Usak who told me where she used to live and maybe that was part of the attraction, but I'm not sure what was the other relationship, whether she did it actually strictly for money and part of human compassion. Maybe it was a combination of both.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was this a very lonely time for you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: It wasn't lonely because I was always active. I was very active. My mind was always going regardless what was going -- what surrounded me. My question was to myself how do you get out of this place. I was fierce about it. I was driven by that. How do you get out and stay alive. Because I felt that I had to say something later on. Maybe this is why I'm here, but I felt that maybe other Jews will survive but I think I had a feeling that I had to say it, to say that part. So lonely, no I wasn't lonely. I was too dynamic to be lonely.</p><p>So, when they saw me coming back from that train station and they greeted me with enthusiasm at least at that point in time I was one of them and soon after we packed our things whatever I had. I don't think I had anything with me. I just had just my hat, my jacket, a scarf, my boots and I was ready to go. We went through the main station, got our ticket. There was a direct train to . It was all night. We went through over night and the following day we were already in . We were picked up by <span class="page-break" number="16"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0 the verge between December and January. It was very cold and we took a train from to a small village close to Tatra Mountains. It was basically a ski resort and we departed from there. We picked up and we kept on walking. It was an area probably that was not very much guarded by the Polish police. By the way, this area was strictly guarded and governed by the Polish people, Polish police force and border police.</p><p>The smugglers were actually Polish. I forget their name. I forget even their faces but we got through and we kept on walking through the Tatra mountains. The episode that I recall was walking in the snow. It was so called and also the snow was very deep. The surface of the snow was frozen so each time you walk into the snow, you like walked into a trap because you couldn't get out. It was a very difficult walk. Now, the lady who was pregnant she had a horrible time walking. At least I had boots but I don't recall if she had boots. So, she kept on walking and her friend, Fessel I have never seen him helping her.</p><p>No one else would try to help her Kline or Joseph. The older fellow Fessel, he had a heart problem. He was always holding his hand on his heart, so he was incapacitated in that mode. I was young. I felt good. I was strong and I tried to help her. I did help her. I kept on walking with her. At first I was walking with her and giving my shoulder to her and embracing her and kept on walking but at least we were in step with the rest of us. At one point in time I asked Fessel to help her because I was getting tired and I asked Usak to help her or Kline to help her and they all felt that they were too tired themselves, they wouldn't survive the trip. I couldn't leave her. I had to walk with her and I walked her and a long time I just carried her and I didn't see any one of the people to help her out. Such a shame, but we survived. We went through the Tatra mountains and got into Slovakia. At least we were there. We were so called safe and the boarder police grabbed us. They took us into a place which I don't recall too much of it, but then later on we identified ourselves as refugees from Poland, so we were all Polish. So, from this police area I think they took us into a school. We were given lunch and had milk and we were cared for. I don't recall how long we stayed there. There was another couple from Poland, independently they came in. They were refugees. One was a professor | think, a Polish professor with his wife, and some other people. At that point they took a picture of us that [had it but I lost it during my other events but Usak got it and showed me some time later. The object has to move from Slovakia now to Hungary and within a few days I think we were moved from Slovakia to another border town which I have a hard time remembering. It was comes to my mind. Maybe I'm wrong but was the border. There were some Jews -- see Hungary at that point in time was not occupied. It was the early part in January. If I recall well, when I was already in Hungary, Hungary was occupied in February by the Germans, maybe a later part of January but not the early part. We were brought in and and <span class="page-break" number="17"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 1</p><p> with the Polish organization with all there were different refugee camps, not camps but offices and you reported yourself that you are one of them. Whether they helped us or not I don't recall. It was immaterial to me. What I wanted to do to identify myself that I am a Polish refugee and to be on their books. From there on it was just a matter of finding out your level of survival. Where do you go from there. The trigger point was the time when the Germans again invaded Hungary. That was the trigger point, be on the run. You had to run again, and where to you run. By that time I had already met some people, not friends, but acquaintances, we became friends because they were in the same shoes. The same problem, where do you run. One thought was to run to get into Turkey. The way you could get to Turkey was through Rumania. The other thought was to run to Switzerland, means you had to go through Austria. Which route do you explore. You explore them both, but one is less dangerous than the other. I felt to be in Switzerland would be a good deal to do, but to go you had to Austria. That was bad. A better way is to go through Turkey through Rumania. I had friends that became my friends that were in the underground movement and I joined them. Some of these people were mostly Jews.</p><p>Some Polish, but that didn't seem that much of a difference because they all were going to run somewhere. I had more trust in my Jewish compatriots because the Polish underground which was a/k Army Crawly, was a group that I wasn't sure I would be comfortable with, so I went with that Jewish group. Even that group, I have some Polish members. I was in a cell. Seven people, we had seven people in our cell. I wasn't given orders to carry out. Basically I was a courier for them, transferring papers from place to place, mainly from Buddha to Paris and from Paris to Buddha and so on. At one time I had to go outside Budapest, but this was a short trip and I came back. One time I had to carry a gun to transfer a gun, but I was doing some carry out orders and I felt good about it. I'm doing something about it. Friends of mine, they were also printing false papers, false birth certificate, false statements of good standing of a given community and so on.</p><p>Church papers I mean a lot of things that was needed for anyone especially for Hungarian Jews. Not specifically for Polish refugees. We were all saved so called. The question now is how do you help out the Hungarian Jews. They needed the papers. They did not have the flexibilities that we did have because we were right outside. There was a time that they were mostly almost confined to the house ghettos. They already had the stars. They had to carry, we did not. We were free. I happened to get myself with the underground and they advised me to have two or three residents in Budapest, having a place to live in Buddha, in Pess -- in Buddha I had to places where to live and when I chose a place to live, I used to live always with a Christian family. I was safe there. Although I tell you I feel at time whenever there was a knock at the door, there was always a heart beat, an extra heart beat that I have developed later on in my life because somebody is knocking at the door at the wrong time and maybe for the right purpose or for the wrong reason as far as I am concerned. So, there were time when they were raiding some areas, but this was in Gentile areas. I never lived with Jewish families, not in Budapest. But there were raids just in general and I was one of them, but I never had an occasion to be examined and to be found that I had any problems with them being either question whether I was a Gentile or not. As a matter of fact, I used to go with those families to the church every Sunday morning, and to be one of them. It was that kind of life that we tried to provide papers to the Jewish people in Budapest. Papers, birth certificates, status certificates and so on. Being in Budapest right in the midst, I'm almost angry with myself not knowing of</p><p> The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

[never heard of him, even in the close circuits that I was that we knew how to survive things. No mention about Swedish consulates and so on. I don't know if I would have gone that route, but at least I was never exposed to that. Friends of mine were exposed to Switzerland and they went that route. I understand he never made it. Another friend went through to Turkey. It was a perfect Gentile couple who had went through a reverse of circumcision. They were perfect in the physiotomy. They got through and through Rumania but they were torpedoed in the Black Sea I</p><p> understand, so they never made it either. I was still there in Budapest and the question was when I'm going to get out of it and one day I have an order to go to Rumania because Ihave asked for them to send me to Rumania and to get in touch with other underground in Rumania. They send me and they told me who to see, when I get over the boarder, what to send them. The question was whether or not the border between Rumania and Hungary is safe. Of course, I was told that the reason they are sending me is to get that message to the other side, to Rumania. Later on I found out that the reason they sent me was to find out whether the border was safe. So, it was one of those things that you have to take your chances. I did not know about that. I found that on later on when I was sick and back in Germany, that I wasn't told the whole truth of the matter. Shortly I went out from Budapest directly to . | think that was the name, that was the city, <span class="page-break" number="19"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 3</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, I was beaten. I was beaten terribly. In other words they put a bar between your legs and then your whole body is folded downwards and you're beaten on your feet. Of course on the buttocks and so on. It was very painful, but I took it. It wasn't a big thing that I recall it was impossible not to survive. They wanted to know again, what was the message that I was trying to deliver to Rumania. Being Jewish I dropped my pants, being Jewish wasn't their concern apparently. I don't recall that. Whether they took it for granted one way or the other, I was never told. The main idea for them was to move me as soon as possible back to Budapest and they took me back to Budapest and they put me in a political prison on . That was the political prison in Budapest <span class="page-break" number="19"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 4 were selecting people left and right, left and right, and they selected me. I think it was a left position and then within an hour or so they pulled me back. Took me back into my barrack. It was at that time that I realized that I am somehow protected and when they look at my tattoo oh you're a , that's the word that | all of a sudden get to my mind, a protected inmate, prisoner whatever. But what I was as a Jewish prisoner or not a Jewish prisoner, I was a Jew with them and it really didn't matter at that time what my status was because I was one of them. One major event that I recall wa the hanging of five Polish prisoners who escaped Auschwitz. When they were brought back, they took out the whole camp to watch the hanging. That was sometime probably in December. It was awfully cold, very cold and we stood probably until two or three o'clock in the morning when the hanging took place and after the hanging normal life proceeded in the camp. Then again there's a gap that I don't recall what was going on, just a matter of daily consumption of the stale bread. The bread came from the transports from the wagons from the trains, but we were given stale bread. It was just at least it was something to eat.</p><p>The food was very terrible, very thin soup, just water. But I was not -- didn't feel that bad.</p><p>I still felt that I could withstand the ordeals and whatever took place because they were talking about soon there's going to be some liberation because Russian troops were moving in closer and closer. As a matter of fact, our thought was that was already taken. Maybe it was a hope, maybe it was not, but anyway they were very close. So, the recreation of Auschwitz was almost eminent. January 5, comes to my mind but I'll stand corrected if it was something else. We were evacuated from Auschwitz and we walked a long time to another station, and I don't recall too well but we were put into open carts, only men. I hadn't seen any women, and they took us out. A horrible trip, a horrible trip, people were dying because of this cold exposure. I had frostbite on both feet. They were persistent, I had shoes that were tight and it was very trying for me personally because I never felt during the whole time that I will be able to survive. I always felt that I could survive. There was a doubt in my mind that I could do it because I couldn't physically move things the way I used to. We were, the train was moving through Czechoslovakia. I know because I heard that and as we were going underneath the overpasses, they were covered with a lot of Czechs and they were throwing bread to us in the open cart. It was a good omen. I had a loaf of bread and Leon, a friend of mine with whom I've been for since Budapest, that's where I met him, he was with me all along in the camp. He survived by the way and he was in Israel. He saw me sometime later in Munich. He visited me in the hospital. We went out and they kept us moving along from place to place. There was no place that they had in mind. We finally wound up in</p><p> , why I don't know. Just before we reached they were discarding all the bodies from the train and people were <span class="page-break" number="20"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 5 actually initiated the coalition and invasion of Europe. When he died a spark left out of me because I felt there is not going to be a continuation in the war, but later on a friend of mine, said another president will take over and he'll continue that. Flossenberg was the time where it was a step before my liberation. I think they took us out on our way to Dachau. That's where we were told an Leon disappeared. I don't know where he went, my friend Leon. There was another fellow, a Russian fellow who was also an inmate and with whom I befriended. He was my friend now that I tried to help him out from the actions in Flossenberg. It was three days and three nights of that death march towards Dachau. April the 23rd we were liberated by the First Army, I think. At that point in time, I was liberated. I was a free man.</p><p>End of Tape #4 Conclusion of Interview The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.
