<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: L understand that. I understand that. It is -- excuse us -- okay. There are -- "m going to talk now, more than I usually do, but it will be in two parts. One, in trying to say back to you what I think I understood. Second, about the purpose of interviews like this, and the whole idea of oral histories. When -- when we -- when we conduct them, the strengths of oral histories are exactly what you say, you know you're right. It is in the impressions, it is in the experiences, it is in the memories.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: The danger is always to have -- make it too narrow, too restricted.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: That -- but in the -- in the purpose of what we're doing here, is we're trying to establish an historical record, through the memories of people, decades after the events happened.

What you are telling me, makes sense to me. But that is because I know of a lot of the history that people who will be looking at this interview, may not. So that's why I want to repeat it back, and see if I have understood it properly, so that someone else can understand it properly.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, do it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. So, here's what I'm under -- here's the impression I'm getting, is that at some point in 1936, or 1937, because that's the time of the Spanish Civil War, and it is a topic that is discussed, you remember being in your bed area, you know, the -- separate from the living room, and lying and hearing -- lying down in your bed, and hearing others in your family, behind the curtains, talking about politics.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not o-others, only one: Povilas and his invited friends.</p></p></dialogue>

And then you remember, but you didn't know this at the time, but you remember at some point in later years, hearing that when Justas Paleckis, who is someone most American or English speaking people would not know about, but Justas Paleckis was a leftist writer, who, when the Soviets came into the country, became the president, quote, unquote. I don't remember his exact title, but SnieC/kus was the first party secretary, Paleckis was the president, and under his signature, a lot of people get sent to Siberia, both then, and later. And what you are saying is that you intuit that your brother was somehow or other, a trusted person, because Paleckis --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Now I remember why.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And I did not even -- could not even tell how many, you know?

Says, how could that be? Because that means that 5,000 people lived in Birzai, and there were 2,000 plus killed, that means almost like a half. So th-there is something wrong, but I think that that figure comes that when the Jews were killed in BirZai, they brought them from all other places, like including Papilys.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Probably that's what -- that's how the 2,000 come. Th -- it does not come from the city itself.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Here is another thought, though, and it also has a certain parallel into how people in the cultural sphere dealt with in Soviet times, that you have --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Here it's very -- totally different, because there you -- you could not ri -- choose your own subject, could not choose your s -- your own theme, and whatever you wrote was the re -- everything was read, and had to be approved. In Germany, at that period, we don't know what would have happened later, with, you know, a familiar, and -- and -- and know how it was during those two plus years.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah, that's -- that's what I'm saying, is that in later decades, there was also wiggle room, where people in the arts, and the culture would te -- in the Soviet Union in general, and this included Lithuania, would -- would write their perfunctory introductory paragraph, or --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah, yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- give perfunctory play --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- that was political, and that was acceptable, and then they'd do what they want to, you know.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But, well, that was not much better than the work, because you still had to be there, and many hours, and -- and since there was no more materials to really do the work on those pieces, they -- we had like to keep cleaning.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay. And so --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: So eventually -- and that's when we concocted a -- when it was reduced to like five or six hours of actual work, and the rest was cleaning, we thought, with Adolfas what -- okay, when we came -- when we left with -- on the same train -- not on the <span class="page-break" number="210"></span> ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion Interview with Jonas Mekas a July 1, 2018 same, had later somehow, they joined -- they transferred from some other train, into our train, two Karaims, Tinfavichas(ph). And then, when we arrived, already they brought us to Elmshorn, we found that there was one -- one more Lithuanian, and he was -- and I knew him from BirZai. He was a young graduate of medical school in Riga, Kregzde, Jonas Kregzde, who was very, very, very, very bright, he spoke many -- Riga had at that time -- was a university where you could study Sanskrit, you could -- oriental languages and philosophies and -- and he spoke them all, and he was in music. We learned really a lot from him. So for some time they put him into our barracks, also. And it's from him -- and he was very close to Jakubenas -- Jakubenas, prof -- Professor Jakubenas was a -- a -- a te -- te-teaching in Kaunas, and there was some religious institute, a Protestant religion institute, and he was quite, you know, prominent in his field in Lithuania. And he had the top -- when some of the intellectuals left the be -- because they're so -- so even he left a -- during the first weeks, I think, or months of German occupation, and -- and settled down in lud -- in hoi -- Holstein --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, Schleswig-Holstein?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Schleswig-Holstein.

So he ended up here in -- in Schleswig-Holstein, in -- in -- in that area. But before he left, he said, if one day you want to try to -- to -- to -- if you think it's realistic to run to Sweden to escape, I will give you some leads. He -- he knew beca -- from Riga, during his studies, he had made contacts with -- with Sweden. So, but he said -- but first if -- before you go, go to Jakubenas and we -- and -- and s-see me, and I will give you then the last, latest contacts to the boats that could take you to Sweden from schwa -- from --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Schleswig-hol --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. So, we -- we talked. Somehow when the -- the hours became shorter, we thought, why don't we tell brothers Neunert that since there is no work here, you know, we could -- maybe we're willing to go to -- to -- to -- they could send us to Kiel.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay. <span class="page-break" number="212"></span> ontactrefieannedjustanmiang er hither btemelortabnattfiexaliaton Interview with Jonas Mekas us July 1, 2018</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: But we also, when we said this, we knew that Kiel was bombed almost every day, every night. So somehow, I -- he did not know what to do with the workers.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Because they're all cleaning, they have nothing else to do.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So, I think the idea came first -- we overheard from him, that he was with his brother, he had a brother who was a very, actually nice supervisor there. He used to be a teacher, and when the war started, they put him in the factory. So, he never liked, he was o -- and he, that helped me -- you see, I had the machine, I was working with the machine. | all -- always had little pieces of paper with German let -- with German words. I was studying there, my language. So he used to come to me like a teacher, and then examine me. So, I think we overheard there was, then figured out -- out what do do with the workers, and that's when we dropped this Kiel idea. So said, oh, yes, I think we -- we will be sending some people, some of the workers, because there they still have materials.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And one image that stays in my mind is what a -- what you had said earlier, during the first part of our interview, when we talked, and I asked, did you know of anybody who had participated in crimes against the Jews, who ha -- could have been</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, I can tell you right now.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You didn't.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No. But from Michael -- Michael -- Michael -- his last name always falls -- has written to me, has said that some of the people that I knew had practiced [indecipherable].

Not in crimes, in the -- that the poet Matuzevicius(ph), who had -- was in the -- from gymnasium BirZai, two or three years earlier than me, and some of his friends -- and so I understood from <span class="page-break" number="245"></span> ontactrefieannedjustanmiang er hither btemelortabnattfiexaliaton</p><p> 249 Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 Michael that he has -- that he has confessed to the Soviet secret police that during the shooting of the Jews, he was asked with his friends to take care to protect their home -- their home belongings [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay, their -- their items, their assets, yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Their assets. So that is the -- so I -- I knew, and -- and actually admired li -- like the -- like the younger, budding, you know, poets cal -- you know, want to be published, and want to be know -- every young poet wants the -- and has it -- some people, close, that he -- older poets that he or she admires. At that time Matuzevicius(ph) was the poet of [indecipherable]. He was the young, like [indecipherable]. And he was good, and very promising. It did not happen, because he was arrested, he went to Siberia, etcetera. He was destroyed. But we, all the younger of ones who -- who were writing poetry, wanted to be poet, admired. So, it was -- when I heard this from Michael, to me was a little bit of a shock. But he was also one of "the six." He said -- so, in those six -- and he wrote a poem about six with -- which was pub-published in BirzZy Zinios, at -- 1 don't know what -- what -- what month. And "the six" became like heroes. People did not know that such -- that they existed, when -- and they found out tha-that somebody was in the underground. Whatever they did, some of them later, I -- I -- I don't know, but I think they were instrumental to -- to star -- help others to decide that they should, you know, work underground also, like -- like those six who worked against the Soviets. <span class="page-break" number="246"></span> ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion 250 Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Now, I thought it was -- when I read it, I thought I -- I als-also like admired that they did it, but I also thought, why is he publishing this?

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So, they figured that I may have joined the partisans, but there may be other -- another reason, because I had also somewhere in -- in the maybe fall or winter of -- of deg41, you know, published in the BirZy Zinios, a stupid --a stupid little, you know, <span class="page-break" number="260"></span> ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion 264</p><p> Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 poems, sort of banal.

So one time I decided to go, and that's, of course, another story. In 1971, that's when I went. Because I already, by that time, I was cle-clever enough, and learned enough of a -- how the world works, that I thought I can use this maybe, to visit my mother.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And could you?</p></p></dialogue>
