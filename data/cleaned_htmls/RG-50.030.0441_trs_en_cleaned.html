<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When did you, did you return to Czernowitz?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I returned to Czernowitz at the end of June 1940 when the Russians occupied Czernowitz, first in order to be with my family, and secondly because at that time an anti-Semitic government was installed in Bucharest.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can you go back for one moment to the inter-war period and tell us if you witnessed any, witnessed any instances of anti-Semitism in Romania?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Before I came in contact with the Romanians, I didn't know anything about anti-Semitism. Say around the age of ten or 12, there was a Congress of, Congress of Romanian students in Czernowitz and they went around town and sang their, their chants about long live Romania, death to the Jews.</p><p>They took off the, there was a municipal theater, they took off the sign which was now <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> officer in the Reserve of the Romania Army. So. And we had to serve a few months longer. In my, in 1937, at the end of 1937, when I was employed in a private engineering firm, the the <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> "Children, these men came to pick me up, my parents are at the railway station. I have to go with them." And I had a job next to the railway station and I came and saw these people in the trains on their way to Siberia.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay, let's move to 22(tm) of June, 1941. Could describe to us what the beginning of the war meant for you and your family and how was Jewish life in Czernowitz during the first days of the war?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Okay, so, June 22" We woke up and on the radio we heard Hitler's voice. Two hundred Russian divisions are on border, we have to defend ourselves and have to go into the, the Soviet Union. There were like probably eight or ten days of waiting period and then the Russians left.</p><p>Quite a number of Jews left with them. I would estimate this as between eight and ten thousand.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: From a population of?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Of, of Jewish population of 60 thousand, approximately. I was tempted to go as well. Quite a number of my friends went, but we were treated badly by the Russian leaders. Say, the, when we stayed at the office in the last day, they gave authorizations to, authorizations of evacuations to all the Russians who came from the Soviet Union but wouldn't give any to us. So I was afraid, at not myself just with some friends, that we would go and they wouldn't even let us in. We were afraid of the Germans coming here, here as, as occupiers but plus, at that time, I was already in love with Lotte. She said, she said, "I never would leave my family, either." And so we stayed and waited for a few more days when the Romanians and with them a few Germans came into Czernowitz.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What happened when the Romanians and the Germans entered Czernowitz? What happened to the Jews?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Okay. This is just on hearsay. A few were, a few hundred, maybe a thousand or more were murdered in the first few days. I know about worked, worked with me. And the chief <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Romanian soldiers. No Germans, I think, were ever involved in any administration of any measures in Czernowitz at that time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can I ask you another question?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember when and if a yellow star or another type of sign was introduced for the Jews?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I would say a few weeks, maybe only two weeks later. We were obliged to put on a yellow star.</p><p>I remember exactly the day, when for the first time we came out into the street with yellow star.</p><p>Two reactions remain in my memory. One reaction was a Romanian priest who passed us on the street, took off his hat. Another reaction was when the wife of a Romanian janitor who said, "That's very good that this happens to you."</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: What happened next?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Okay, next, it was very tough with, because, at this time there was no, not, not enough food.</p><p>There was many other, there was no electricity, so we had to go and buy food and buy, buy kerosene. And you couldn't get kerosene and food with the star. So we stayed and we _ took off the stars and stayed in line and took kerosene. Few days later, a young student, military student, we had at that time I think this was a still high school for military high school, say in, in preparation for officer school. So a student of this school recognized me a day or two later that I didn't have the star and he saw me with the star and took me to work in the, in the field. With other like 40 or 50 Jews. So we worked all day and in front of all of these, he, he picked me . Now, this <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> the assistant head. So he recognized me and he talked this over with the, his chief which was the inspector for that bridges and track and they took me to work. Though at that time I got paid only the pay of a soldier and from then on and through this employment, I, I was not harassed again with forced labor.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay, can you describe where did you live, how was housing? If you could take your time and describe for us the process of ghettoization(ph) in Czernowitz?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. Okay. Now at that time, yeah, so let, yeah. Two of us, my brother who was a student at the Polytechnic in Bucharest, we, he has not finished at that time, and myself, we came back when the, with the Russia occupation. My mother and my two sisters, they had quite a good apartment and we stayed all four of us together under, under the Soviet Occupation and continued then under the Romanians. Lotte, with her family, stayed diagonally across on the same street so we met there quite often and though as I said, in the beginning, we had problems with food, but because in the Bukovina, like in all of Romania, food was plenty and then we got to barter different things from house. We bartered with the peasants and we got at that time food enough. Now, this is only say one more month because in October at that time, the ghetto started.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So what happened to you and your family?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: At the ghetto? <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> those who will help flee people away." So I said to her, "I don't understand. This has no relation to us. We don't want to flee and we don't want to give shelter," and I read to her. One o'clock I came home for lunch and I saw already people on the street with backpacks. Say what happened? We have to go into a ghetto. So I came home and we packed. My family, they were already packed but we didn't ever to go. So I went across the street to Lotte and she said, "We go to a cousin of mine who is in the street, in a street which belongs to the, lives in the street which belongs to the ghetto," so we went. And then, there were 11 of us and my mother and her four, four children, Lotte and her sister and their parents and the fiancee of the sister, mother. We all went to this cousin of Lotte's who lived not far from this place and we slept on the, the floor for a few days. Six o'clock in the evening, they, a barricade was, was built and we couldn't get back, get out of the, of the ghetto.</p><p>Next two days, there was just met on the street and discussed what is going to happen we's, we were supposed to be into Transnistria, which is a province east of Bessarabia, which Germany gave to the Romanians for . On, on October 14", we were told that these three, few streets including ours should pack and go to the railway station. So we put all our belongings on a peasant cart. The peasants came to make some money and we waited on the street to go to the railway station to the trains, bringing us Transnistria. In the meantime, while staying there, the people started talking that some number will stay, will not go. And said, one lady said, "You know, engineers should stay." So a Romanian major passed by and I said, "Mr. Major, I</p><p> , should I stay or go?" He said, "Stay." So I took with Lotte this cart which had all the belongings of the 11 of us and we took it out of the streets leading to the railway station into a part of the ghetto we were supposed to leave the next days. We had to bribe a soldier because he was supposed, we were not supposed to go, go there and there we stayed on the floor, all of us, one night only. Next, that evening, Parryom Poppovitch(ph) came to the Jewish Hospital which was the seat of the Jewish community or say the council, Jewish council, we could the <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> house belonging to uncle of Lotte's where we stayed for the next, "til the end of the ghetto. But, okay, so I said...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: For how long did you stay in that house?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: For almost, okay, so next day this good news from Parryom Poppovitch(ph) were not that good any more because we were told lists will be arranged by professions and then they will decide who stays, who goes. So, on this day, I said to Lotte, "Either we stay or we go, let us get married." This was already the Friday after the Sabbath Day when the ghetto started. And I saw across the street from this house where said, "Rabbi, we would like to get married." He said, "Too late." It was Friday, two o'clock.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So the rabbi said it's too late.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. So next morning, we went to the commander of the ghetto who was a major of the Romanian army. The army was the supervised, this matter and said, "Mr. Major, we would like to get married." So he gave us a soldier, an escort and we went in the morning to the court because it would, the court had to give us a dispensation so we could get married without two weeks waiting. Then we went back in the afternoon, we went to City Hall. City was supposed to, they opened at five o'clock in the evening. five o'clock in the evening, so we took this soldier four o'clock and I went first to the railway administration and they told us don't worry, we have given, we have given the government all the names of our Jewish employees, you will stay.</p><p>Then I went to our other place where my, where my brother worked and this lady took his name, all the personal data, said, "I will help him." Then five o'clock we were married. The, all the employees in this registration office were very gentle. Either by themselves or the mayor was Parryom Poppovitch(ph) but the registrar who was a university professor, he told me, "Mr.</p><p>Engineer," before the procedure, "Mr. Engineer, I hope to celebrate for you Jews many more happy, many more happy occasions also here in Romania." And then we went back home, they already, each took out of his backpack whatever, and this was our, our marriage ceremony. And we didn't get, go on the honeymoon to Transnistria. Two days later I got two authorizations to stay, one on the list of the civil engineers, 27 engineers say, <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> took a number and then I got it from the, as a railway engineer. And my brother was a mining</p><p> so he got it too. Two days later, we went home. I think approximately 12 days after we left.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Let me, let me ask you if you witnessed, witnessed any scene of deportation of other people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was in the railway station and saw them going to the trains.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What did you see?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I would say that I didn't see anybody being beaten. Everything was orderly. They went with their backpacks to the trains and went on the train. There was no, this was already November 1941.</p><p>In January deg41, they had these little squalor, or how you call it in, in Bucharest.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uprising.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Uprising. Here...[End of Side 1 of Tape 1]...there was no brutality. Everybody went with his backpack quietly to the trains. I was told later when they came back, that they were chased across the , with, with brutality. But I didn't witness, I, I witnessed only quiet, their quiet way into the, boarding the trains. Saw it, I saw it from the window of my offices. I would like</p><p> toend...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because I already said this about the gentleness in the office of the registrar in, in the city hall.</p><p>That during my, the following two and a half years, during my work in this railway office, I encountered only gentleness. Some they have been anti-Semites, they were happy that the Jews were not . The assistant head of the section kissed me when I came back to work and a German, a German who worked with , he treated me with <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 0 business of the Germans. During the Russian Occupation, the Germans emigrated to Germany.</p><p>There was, this was an agreement between the Soviet and the German government. So there was a lot of business to be had in, in Czernowitz and many people from Romania came. If they needed, they needed and these were the so they took them into and they, they may not have paid them very well but they were very happy to have people to carry on their business.</p><p>So, somehow, a rule of law was back and you had to wear the star. And we had the curfew at eight o'clock in the evening. But we're very young and we had friends and we met Sunday for be playing bridge or in order to, not to be on the street at eight o'clock, we slept with our friends or they came to sleep with us and we partied and lived there quietly. With fear, with fear because there was, we knew there is a still long way to go.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Let me ask you another question. Did you witness the deportations from Czernowitz from 1942, from June 1942 and if you witnessed something, what exactly you witnessed?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Okay. In, in June 1942, on three consecutives Sunday mornings in number two or three thousand Jews Czernowitz, were taken again into Transnistria. These were mainly the people who didn't have government authorizations, who had had authorizations only from Parryom Poppovitch(ph). Plus, other people who were politically suspect. For instance, a cousin of Lotte's, a doctor, who had, who was a director of a hospital and other people who were not considered reliable. Leaning, left leaning, or if an engineer who, like me, had come from Romania to Czernowitz to the Russians. But he was, he was with the railways, say 50 kilometers south from, from Czernowitz and he left his employment and came to Czernowitz. And the police found out and they took him so these people were deported in June of "42. We, in the first night, the bell ring, so I went to the door, open the door and here two soldiers, policemen, policemen asked me, "Are you Kahanni(ph)?" Says, "No," I say, "Kahanni(ph) lives here next door." So this lady Kahanni(ph) had a Polish authorization, she knew somebody was coming and went into hiding. But early morning, we from our windows, people being assembled in the streets on their way to these . This was the that they stayed throughout Sunday, some of <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 1 agents of the government and with some some discussions, a few were taken back but for the few who were, who, who came home, other people were taken. There was a quota which had to be like 20 or 35 , 1 don't exactly. And the third Sunday, too many people were <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 2 come closer and closer. And in March they were already, say, not far in former Poland, say like hundred or 200 kilometers from German . Now by say, after mid-March, say maybe this was already 20" of March, the Romanian left and there were a few days of an interim(ph). In these days, no more Romanians there but few German, probably German SS or so.</p><p>And Lotte's sister, she went across the street and was taken by these Germans into a place where she was interrogated. And then the Germans brought us to that house and there was most elderly people, I was the only youngster and they came to me with, with, with down here next to me. Do! Give me your watch. So I gave the watch and then he took the other watches and they left. Next day the Russians were here so these watches fell into the hand of the Russians because the same thing continued the next few days with the Russians. When the , "Give me your watch."</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Let me, let me ask you another question. Did you witness the return of the Jewish deportees from Transnistria to Chernowitz?(ph)</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: What we first witnessed was a few Polish Jews who came right after the, the Russian Army, Soviet Army. And here for the first time we heard about a real Holocaust. We knew that say, that brutal things happened. But we didn't have any details about what was happening. Embarrassingly enough, do you know a name, a man by the name of Fred Bernard(ph)?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He has a witness. I, one, say two or three days after the Russians were back, I meet on the street, this man Fritz he was called, now he's Fred. Said, " ." So I said, he fled with the Russians and couldn't get through and he lived in Kalizia(ph) in Poland, to these two and a half years. And he told me details about what he witnessed first being in, on, from a hiding place on top of the house. He witnessed how the Germans, a German and a Polish : He told me that only details. He survived then, he was a doctor and he had helped quite a few people over there in Poland and they hid him so he came back with with the trucks, with the Russian Army.

As a railway engineer, I went, I went far out say into Bessarabia and I saw them walking, walking home from those . So I, I met quite a number of people coming back. Plus, between this was an aunt who came back from Mogilev and a cousin who came back. Which I had to go, the Russians didn't let her go across the bridge over the, the river , and I went after , | brought her back because I had my papers. .
