<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When you, or your husband, went to work, and you went to separate places every day, were you worried that you wouldn't come back together?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I wanted to know how you got chosen for a different work group.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, that. We used to get up in the morning, 4:00 in the morning. Had a cup of coffee. Had to make coffee, you know I -- You didn't have anything, no wood, no nothing, so you used to take a big nail, a heavy one, put it into the electricity, and have a little -- something, you know, like a jar -- and you put it in in the jar, and the water was boiling and you didn't have coffee, but , we used to call it. It is just like something -- and we used to have in the morning, before we went, to have that, and a tiny little slice bread, and go to work. Sometimes we didn't have the bread. So, at least to have warm inside. And I used to go out, I used to see the Bad (ph) Brigade, but you can't get because there was a whole lot people, but I knew them. But fortunately, I used to be lucky.</p><p>Fortunately, they used to pull me out from the Good brigade, and take me to the Bad brigade. What means a Good brigade? A Good brigade means you can work hard, it's no different. What it is, you are young, you are healthy, and then you take something to run in, around the people there because __ used to be, and sell them something -- like a sleep, a place (ph), a something, whatever you had. And for that, you used to get some food. So at least -- or used to have some bread. Butter? We didn't know what it means, butter. No butter, no milk, no nothing. But at least, when you had the bread, you see, the coffee, like I explained to you, it's okay, you can make it.</p><p>Who knew what it means, meat? Nothing. You didn't have nothing. But potatoes was very good, you know. A potato you can mix up with something else or you have to have. And you make something, add meal from that (ph). I remember one time, that they said you can bring in food.</p><p>Well, the Good brigade -- when you used to have -- I used to take off my Star of David. I looked like a . And I was gone from one place, from one door to the other. Until, you know, they used to give us something. Some people said, "We don't have any," but they just potato <span class="page-break" number="15"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 7 peels. I said, "It's okay, too." I used to take potato peels. Whatever we could get to bring home.</p><p>Potato peels, they wouldn't bother you so much -- unless (ph) they used to think that you have something else.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, what would happen if you got caught bringing this food back?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Terrible, terrible. They used to send you in jail. That -- you were lucky. If they send you to jail.</p><p>But some was good for me, you know, who was the brigade commanders (ph), you know, with the German guards. There was already good ones who let you go to do -- some of them was murderers.</p><p>They didn't. If they had caught you -- it didn't hurt me so much the way they beat me up for the bread -- I didn't kill the pain, but I killed the pain for the hunger, to be hungry. For not having, but for taking away the bread from me. You see what I mean? You didn't kill no pain. But pain was hunger, no food to eat. Starving. So when we used to go the brigade, we used to have a Good brigade, so at least you used to get some clothes to change for food. So, when I used to come to the Christians there that knew me already, so they used to give me something to eat, a slice bread, it was okay, with some water.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, did these Christians -- did they think you were just a poor farmer girl or what?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Hmm-mm. The Christians?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. When you went to get something from them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, L used to come back -- they didn't give you for free. But we were lucky that they gave us, for the clothes, what they had, because they figured, they said, that the ghetto -- the models (ph) from the clothes. Because why? Clothes you could have. They didn't take away. They took away from you the books, the paintings, the grand things. But clothes, as much as you could, you could take it in. The furniture, everything, you have to give. So you see? So when you used to have something to change, why not? They used to give you, you know? So they used to have a This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

It means that you used to have a good day with the food, but what you got, you are happy. I was running, smiling, I have something. But the worst thing was if you came to the ghetto, to the brigade, you know. So, if you had a good brigade, then you go through. If you have Bad brigade, you're in trouble.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And how did you know which one you were in?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, that's what happened to me. I was looking for a good brigade. I knew where the good brigade was. And I was moving from one place to the other, and that's what I got caught, and that's what I got beat up. But it didn't, like I said, it didn't bother me, it didn't hurt me, you know, the way I was beated up, but it hurt me why I lost the bread. It's rich people, known people, in Lithuania, they didn't have nothing to eat. My husband -- he'll tell you tomorrow about it -- the way we used to help them -- from the same, what we had, you split in half -- half for us and half for them. And...

She was only four months old. And the way we were running and coming back, the way I told you before? And it was no help from doctors and so on and so she passed away. During in the ghetto, a lifetime, I used to run -- I used to get orders from the farmers, from the Christian people, what they need. "Can you bring me so-and-so? I'll have for you a nice package." I used to run in the ghetto, look at somebody had something, what they ask. And I used to ask him, how much does he want? And he used to tell me the price, how much they want to have. I used to go there to the people, the Christian people, who order, and I used to get, you know, a package or money, whatever itis. But the main thing it is that they want to have, you know -- food. So, it wasn't too hard to run and to go and to sell it to the people and bring for the people who needs the food. And now we had enough food for a couple days, probably, enough bread and so on. I stopped talking about the family, you know. But she had her parents, and she went herself. Her name was Bergma, Celia (ph). No food, no clothes, no -- even no water. So one day, they said that you can take in some wood, in the ghetto. You know what I did? I brought her -- you know, the wood -- and I gave to her and I told her (ph), go ahead, you go have hot water, you can have something to cook on. It was a risk to go out. It was really a risk. You think that the -- the Christian people, they used to say, "Please try to be careful. Try to be careful because you never know what can happen to you." But when hunger -- when you're hungry, you don't have nothing to heed. Nothing can stop you. I didn't care. Let them shoot me. Let them kill me. As long I am alive, I'll try to have something, the main thing was, you see, my Jay. It wasn't easy. But the hardest thing in the world was for me when I lost my people.</p></p></dialogue>

I find out later, instead, they should go and get one person, they said, the singles (ph). It would take them a whole lot to get the people, so they took bigger families. So, what they did, they took my family. Five people in ten minutes. Right before I tear them out of my arms, they was already gone. [Crying] I couldn't do nothing. I couldn't do not a thing because the police and the German guards, and I didn't thought that that could happen to them. It was about ten or eleven o'clock in the morning. Since then, I didn't see them anymore.</p><p>My last -- please forgive me, I'm sorry. But do you know what it means to lose your family in ten minutes? I never could forget. And I shall never forget. At night, you cannot sleep, you've got the dreams. It's awful. It's awful, it's painful.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: In October of 1943. Between that time, there was a city with the name Shabut (ph), and there was a number of Jewish people. And the people of Shabut (ph), that was, at that time, from October until December. They took the children from the parents out there. And somebody came to tell us that the children from Shabut (ph) had been taken away from the parents. Children, little ones, until up to 12 years. Twelve years, they can still go on at the work . Sol said to my husband, <span class="page-break" number="20"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 2 And then I used to send for him, for the farmer, he wants a suit I used to bring him, a suit. I used to run away, like I told you. I used to make my work, my work is finished, then I used to take off my Star of David, and used to run. I used to go. There was a coal brigade. There was, not too far from the coal brigade, a neighbor. And that man used to come to that neighbor. They knew each other.</p><p>So when I got in over there, I used to find him. When I found him, first I have to finish my work.</p><p>Four women has to finish to shovel the coal from the -- what you call it? -- train. So they used to have -- oy, like a choo choo train. So when I finish my work, and everything already finished, they didn't bother you, as long you finished at the coal brigade (ph). Then I went with him and I got in contact with him. And I told him about the baby. And I said, "Please, immediately, try to get my uncle and tell him about the teddy (ph). And please, he should help us to get out from the ghetto." That's the way I got in contact with my uncle. And I was in the brigade. And then, I had a nice, good package. He brought me some -- like, eggs, and he got a few pieces of butter, and bread, and flour. And when I got that, it was already late. The coal brigade was already gone. And I was left over by myself. Now, what should I do? Where shouldI __? "It's no place. No place where to go and what to do. I was fortunately lucky. It was there go slow (ph), you know -- what you call it?</p><p>It was a brigade, but they used to make -- go slow, all the , and they used to take up from the <span class="page-break" number="21"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 3 people got clothes or something, you know. They made some packages -- good for us (ph).And all of a sudden, the guard from Gestapo came in to see what's going on by the coal brigade. Had seen their packages. And he asked, "Whose package is this one?" One girl got up and she said, "It's mine." She said, "Take the package." ___--_--. Who she did, nobody knows. I had seen what had happened to her, so I already run away. I didn't look to him. And that arrogant Gestapo, what happened to her. I just don't know. Because why? She hada package. That was wrong. That was wrong. The life in ghetto is worse than a dog in the street. Four o'clock in the morning, they used</p><p> . They used to call up to get dressed and get out and take them in a special place, special field. Cold, bitter cold, to test what the people gonna do. Having my little boy, before you dressed him -- here you couldn't see here in the clothes. I used to put up everything in his little bed that he used to be -- put up everything that in the morning, if it should rain, I should have right away for him, to dress him, and to be outside. How many people have there been -- in there room? No, less than that -- eight -- I think about eighteen or nineteen, maybe more. People there were sleeping on the floors. There was no beds, no sofas. But at least we had a pillow. And we had, you know, a</p><p> , whatever. It's -- who can describe the horrible things in the ghettos.

But each holiday, when it used to come, the Gestapo gave you right away a holiday -- taking people, sending them to the Ninth Fort, to kill the people there, to take off their bodies from the . . . from the caves. We never had a holiday that we should enjoy.</p><p>Because each holiday, when it used to come, always used to be bitter because they used -- they always gave you such a rough time. Used to take our peoples, they used to kill the people, they used to hang the people. Honey, I cannot tell you, just in the three hours, what they did. Before they went to the airport, they took 2,000 people -- and it was Rosh Hosanna -- and some people didn't want to go because it was the holidays. And what do you think they did? They killed them. They killed them to show them that you must go to work, it's no holidays. So you asked me about holidays -- each holiday, no matter what, when used to come, always was bitter, full with tears, full of fear, full of pain. You cannot describe, even in Yiddish, which I know so good, I wouldn't be able to describe it. But I went through, and so many people went through. But, I was fortunately lucky. Iam alive. There have been other people -- no more.</p></p></dialogue>

The Gestapo didn't know. But we had activities -- I don't remember, I don't know. Because you see, I was a slave. I was a slave. I used to go out in the morning, come back, see everybody's okay.

He was from Shabut (ph) and he came here because he got married, for a girl, you know, who's from Kovno. And then more people -- they was very active. And they came in, you know, when it was the big selection, the 10,000 people, like I told you.

Go ahead and do by yourself. So when we got out, it was in October 28th, I think, in the big field. And then you have to have luck -- who's alive and who's dead. And then they took out close to 10,000 people and they killed them, all of them. I think -- I don't know -- one survived, but I know that all of them got killed because they didn't let nobody stay at home, and everybody has to go out. And Dr. Elkis (ph) didn't want to have on his conscience that here, that is your life, and that is your dead. And then the unirat, you know, they used to have some trouble there. But they used to do something for them -- they gave them a year (ph), a present, or something, I don't know. The people trouble as they was in Gestapo, you know, but you go into the Gestapo, it is good-bye. You are not coming back to the ghetto, you are not coming back alive. So we used to help them.

And that's what I remember -- that when I had food brought, heavier than I was -- a pekel (ph), the way we used to say it -- and I said to myself, I hope everything will be okay.
