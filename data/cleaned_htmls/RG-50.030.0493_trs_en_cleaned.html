<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Her name?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> A Clara, Clara Jacobson Schwab. My mother was a wonderful, wonderful person, but in contrast to my father, she was very, very strict in the upbringing and well, let's say, my father would say to my mother sometimes I would hear him say, "Well, just leave him alone." He'd said. So, she would say, "No, no, no, he has to be taught his manners, this and that, so on and so forth." But, I-- also wonderful. Well, I wouldn't say wonderful, but strict governesses particularly a German governess who taught me a lot which I didn't like because I liked to rebel.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you get that from you father a little bit, the rebellion?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I think it's more my personality, but I don't think neither my father nor my mother were rebellious types, no, no, and also not my brother, but I was -- I was a talkaton. I could talk non-stop, and my mother used to tease me that I have her big ears because I listened to things I'm not supposed to listen to because everything interested me. So, on my days with my mother, which was usually Wednesday, I could determine what she would wear, and we would go and I would go to with her to my favorite cafes and I would pretend that I was drawing doing something, but I would overhear what my mother was talking with her girlfriends. So, the gossip in town, et cetera, but I didn't understand much of it, but-</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But, you took it in.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But, I took everything in because everything was I found very interesting, very fascinating.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, old would you have been when she took you on her little trips to the cafe?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, it started rather early because I would say about five, started five, six, seven, eight, nine, yes because I also refused to eat for a while at home.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, and it was a problem, but by that time I must've been about six or seven, and I had an aunt who came from Riga, who had recently left Vienna, after Hitler. Yeah, actually, it must've been already *38 after the Anschluss in "38. I must've been about eight. She came especially from Riga after coming back from Vienna to Riga, she came especially to Libau. She said she is going to make from me Viennese sandwiches, and anything along those lines was of interest to me, and when she served me on the little piece of bread, piece of Wienerschnitzel or whatever, I said, "Well, I know what this is. It doesn't interest me." So, finally, my mother asked, "What would interest you?" And, I said, "I would love to go to Hotel Petersburg, and eat over there." That was a hotel in Libau, and had also a beautiful restaurant, also was private rooms, et cetera, and she would take me there late in the afternoon about</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

It was what I loved, but everything -- with anchovies with everything. Some people complained actually, and the manager of the hotel came and said to my mother, "Mrs. Dr. Schwab", that's the way we used to address people, ""There's some people who object to seeing your son put everything into the hot chocolate and eat it then." So, we were given a separate room, and for six months, I did this, and then I started eating again. I had some sort of disorder, whatever it was, I don't know, but for about six months, we went almost every single day to the Hotel Petersburg in Libau, and that's how | ate, and also I continued at home to put everything into hot chocolate. Hot chocolate, whatever I had was hot chocolate sandwiches.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, do you think you needed soft food? Is that why you think you-</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, it was just tasty.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It was tasty.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was tasty, and whatever else I liked were desserts -- cakes, and cakes naturally are fantastic. So, I remember always also during the day, et cetera, sneaking in sometimes alone or with an aunt of mine or with my governess going to a particular cafe in Libau for just cakes. I just loved sweets.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It's interesting because even though your mother was very strict. She realized that she needed to ask you what you wanted.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes, because it was a problem, and my father also. I don't know to what extent he knew what to do or didn't know because in those days, actually, if a father was a physician, he was not permitted to treat his son. You had to go to someone else, and the pediatrician, my pediatrician, was a man by the name of Dr. Rabinovitz, who was the father of the head of -- later on -- the head of intelligence in Israel, , and <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I would say by the time the war broke out, yes, when we didn't, yeah. And, actually, it was yesterday, I think, yes at the Holocaust Museum that I had some hot chocolate for the first time in years.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was it good?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Wonderful, I loved it. (laughs) I loved it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell me about your brother. What was his name?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Bernhard Boris Schwab, and for short we called him Bubi.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Bubi.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Bubi, he was about eight, nine years older than I, and he -- he adored me. He loved me very, very much, but I was sometimes not very nice to him. I would tease him this and that, so on and so forth, and sometimes he got angry at me I remember, running after me and sort of hitting me over my rear because I really teased him a lot. I remember once on a tennis court, after I annoyed him, but he was really wonderful, and until he was taken away, I mean, he took very, very good care of me when we were just the two of us and we were alone, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And, was he an easy going...?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He was easy going, yes. He loved to read. He devoured reading, and it's very interesting. The last two years of the Gymnasium, he remained sitting. He failed because he was interested in his own agenda just to read. He was interested, and he just kept on reading and didn't care about school, but this happened with me too when I went to school. One day, I remember coming home and declaring, "I know everything there is to know. I know how to count to a hundred." I knew the alphabet.</p><p>"And, I'm not going to school anymore or if I have to go to school, I will simply not pay attention because I love to play with my games and toys, et cetera, et cetera." And, sure enough I failed every course save English because English was something - you were a wizard if you learned English and very, very few people because my parents were brought up with French, but I was brought up with English. I had British tutors and so did my older brother. So, I passed only one subject.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: English.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: English, and that was English. I remained sitting, and what was -- what happened was war broke out and the first thing in 1941, I thought, "My god, war broke out now. I will not have to go back to school."</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And, that was relieving to you?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were your parents upset that you were happy about this?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no, actually, I've been thinking about it, and I don't remember having discussed this with my father, but they did not seem to be perturbed or anything of the sort.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And, no one said to you, "You don't know everything, George, if you just can count to a hundred." I mean nobody -- they just accepted what you said.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They accepted what I said, and they let me play, and I played a lot. I was fortunate to have a lot of toys, and I just -- trains and trains, toys, all sorts of toys. I was imaging that I was a general -- that was already in 1939, 1940 -- on the Line and a cousin of mine was the general of the Siegfried, yeah, he was Siegfried Lineland, and I was . We played war, and we had tanks and we had airplanes, and we had all <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> had office hours, if memory -- memory serves me right, from four to six. But, he had so many patients that he sometimes did not come and have supper before eight, eight- thirty when I did not see him because I was already in bed or whatever.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And, dinner when you would eat what we call lunch, but dinner in the middle of the day, were there a lot of conversation? Was this is a very perfunctory sort of eating?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, it was always interesting conversation, and when I was finally permitted to join them, when I was sufficiently trained, I enjoyed it very, very much. But, then, when I did sort of things that were unacceptable at the table, I was sent back.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And, where would be "back" to-?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: To my room.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Would you eat there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I would eat there with my governess.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But, when I was permitted to sit at the table -- see, I try to make sure that I wouldn't really spoil things because I didn't want to be sent back.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But, from time to time, I was sent back.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And, was this your mother making the decision?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Mostly my mother, yes. My father thought everything was amusing. He did not contradict my mother, but I remember one little incident when my father came in -- which very often happened. He was not there on time at two or two-thirty when we would have the lunch. He came in late, and he just paced in the dining room, and my mother didn't talk to him and he didn't talk to my mother which was unusual, and it still sticks in my mind. It happened once.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And, tell me about your governesses.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I had a nanny as a -- when I was a very small child. She was Russian, Fanya, and I adored her. She was -- I just could've sold my parents. She was -- she was it so far as I am concerned, so far as I was concerned And then I was being prepared that I'm going to be a big boy, and the summer we were going to spend in Riga Beach, and when I will come back, I will have a governess and no longer my nanya, my nanny, and I didn't really understand what they were saying, and we always went summers to Riga spend time at the Riga beaches, to the resorts in Riga. And, when I</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

She was <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And, given the fact that your mother wasn't working, what was she doing during the time when you and your brother -- when he was young enough -- was being taken care of by a governess?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My mother used to be a professional cellist.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. She went to the famous Riga Conservatory which was a very, very famous school where as Isaac Stern once put it, you could go to any of these Russian violinists, it doesn't matter who it is, they all came out from Riga, from the conservatory. She was playing a lot, but not professionally. Every two weeks or so, there were chamber music evenings at our house. She would drag her cello, go to the homes of other people where they'd play, and evenings when they would go out a lot, there was an opera, there was a theater in Libau. There were people who would come to our house for card games, kind of gin rummy that they used to play, and then there were big events in the house where the men would play a game called , and the women would play gin rummy which they called in Latvia, Kunken.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Kunken?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Kunken, K-u-n-k-e-n, it was a kind of gin rummy. I tried to mingle sometimes, and sometimes I actually succeeded and she did not say anything, but there was a very interesting incident that I remember. I loved dogs, but my mother did not permit us to keep dogs in the house. So, I would bring stray dogs to the house.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Into the house?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Into the house.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But, we had several entrances, bring it in through the rear entrance where we had a very large kitchen and a maid's room, in between the kitchen and the maid's room, there was another little corridor. And, my mother hardly ever went into the kitchen.</p><p>So, she didn't know what was going on, and I kept the dog over there in the rear and we also had a balcony. One day, there was a big card game at the house.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you like it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I never liked the cello.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, but she also played the piano. We were forced to play the piano as children. I preferred to piano. I didn't like the cello. I preferred, of all the instruments, I preferred the violin, but my favorite instrument is still the piano.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But, I was -- before I hated it because I was forced to play it for something like five years. My older brother, too, and my mother would sit there and listen to us play, and correct us so on and so forth, but we had teachers who taught us.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, I know a bit about why she was a disciplinarian. Being a musician, they go together in some ways.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: George, how much older was your father in relationship-</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: My father was about twenty years older than my mother, and it was interesting because my father was engaged several times before he met my mother, and he came back -- and this was in Riga, he came back from an engagement with a cousin of his and going back to Libau because my grandfather was at that time sick apparently.</p><p>And, on the railroad station, he saw my mother with a number of other young women seeing off somebody on a train that was going to Germany. And, my father said to his cousin, "This is the woman I'm going to marry." So, his cousin, whom I knew, he died about twenty year ago in South Africa, said, " You're crazy. You're nuts.</p><p>You just came from an engagement." He said, "I don't care, and I'm going to go to the train and I'm going to sit in the same , in the same compartment with this <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 2</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Take it off because she didn't like mustaches. So, what she did -- they got married, and then he said, "Well, now we'll go to Libau." So, my mother was under the impression that he would stay in Riga and move in with the rest of the family because she was not interested in going to Libau. And, later on when she spoke of home when we lived in Libau, home to her was always Rega, which was very interesting. It was home. It was a very happy marriage I must say. They adored each other. And, I must say that I grew up in, despite the sternness of my mother, I grew up in a very warm home.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, she was affectionate as well as stern?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yes. She was affectionate, but stern. There was no nonsense. There's a right way, and there's a wrong way, period.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, this story that you just recounted, you heard from your mother I gather.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not only from my mother, but I also from the cousin from South Africa. We were talking about, and he recounted it. And, also from an aunt of mine who -- and some of my mother's friends in New York.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Very lucky that they got along. It's a very strange story.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes, but they did, and there's still a woman actually in London who is a very close friend of one of the people who works with , very close family friend, but <span class="page-break" number="11"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 3</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But my mother was the first of the sisters to get married.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, and when we would go on the trains to Riga, my life's ambition was to become an engineer who drives a locomotive, or whatever you call them. This was my horizon. And, when the planes starting flying between Riga and Libau, passenger planes, I've never been on a passenger plane Riga-Libau, I wanted to be come a pilot.</p><p>So, speed, in other words-</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Is very important.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -is very important, and where did I get it because I saw a lot of the American movies in Libau where you saw in New York, bridges going up, cars, all these things. It made a tremendous impression on me. I loved American movies. I loved Shirley Temple and I went around saying she was a cousin of mine. (laughs)</p></p></dialogue>

My mother usually accompanied him. There was a driver downstairs, and sometimes I went along, and I stayed with my mother in the car and my father went in. But, I remember one incident with a Latvian patient, my father decided to take in the car -- the back seat in the car with my mother and him -- between my mother and him, and I was in the front with the driver, and the patient was very, very sick and the patient's wife was also there and blamed the car.</p></p></dialogue>

This was a Latvian school. He was a patient of my father's. He came to the house and apologized to my parents that it would never happen. I was calledin__ office. He did not apologize to me. He turned the tables and said, "You have to be a good boy." I told this to my parents. "Don't worry. It's not going to happen again", et cetera, et cetera. In this class of about 25, there were three Jews, but when the teacher made this remark that I read like a Jew, everyone started to laugh. It was very embarrassing to me, obviously, and this irked me. But, otherwise, I personally did not sense any, what we would call today, anti-Semitism. In those days, I wouldn't have known the term, obviously. Next to our school was a Jewish School, and sometimes we had matches -- soccer matches -- not soccer matches actually snowball fights. So, we the Latvians would fight the Jews, the Latvians school and Jews, but did not have any overtones. It did not have any overtones.</p></p></dialogue>

She didn't know -- she would make the steaks, and she said to me in the diminutive jocular, I don't know what I do, but you can play football with it because it was all to her cooking.

There were a lot of discussions, and I will never forget when the aunt who came to Libau, she was going to make me these Viennese sandwiches so on and so forth, I remember still my aunt was saying to my father, the Anschluss was taking place in Vienna when Hitler marched in, that Jewish women were forced to take off their furs and to wipe and polish the cars. My father said, "You're dreaming. I don't believe it. German Culture, Deutsch Couture, they wouldn't do this." And, my father, to an extent, was a product of German culture, and during World War I, the German occupation, they behaved very, very properly toward the indigenous population of Latvia. So, my father dismissed it.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Life was very, very fine, very beautiful, very exciting. I loved to go to Riga. I could never understand why we lived in Libau in such a small city and not in Riga with 13 trolley car lines and Libau only two. More interesting cafes that in Libau, better gossip, I guess.</p></p></dialogue>

I was on the Riga beach with one of my aunts and cousins and uncle, and my mother immediately came to Riga to the beach to fetch me, and I was in my aunt's apartment. This was already a day or two before it happened, in my aunt's apartment which was not very far from the Soviet embassy in Riga, and from her terrace, I could hear over the loud speaker Vishinsky, the notorious Vishinsky addressing the crowd, welcoming Latvia to the Soviet Union because the Soviets came in at the invitation of the Latvians, according to him, and from the balcony, from the terrace, I could also see how the Latvians were marching with big banners, and I assumed that on those banners were "Welcome Russia.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, the adults in Riga, but my mother took me a day or two later, took me back to Libau, yes. So, in Libau, we went to the beach as usual, to the tennis courts still in the first few weeks, et cetera. Finally, we were permitted to talk to Russian soldiers because the Russians had established bases in Latvia already in September, October 1939 as a result of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, but we were not permitted to talk to Russians.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He was very friendly, very friendly. He would come. He would sleep. He would leave, but this was his room. He had the keys to the apartment.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, he didn't eat at your house?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: This I don't recollect. I don't recollect him eating in the house. Maybe in the kitchen or so. I don't recollect this in the dining room. I don't recollect this, but we also had to -- we could no longer have sleep-ins.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What does that - Do you mean with other people coming in?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well sleep-ins, I mean, because nobody was permitted to be a housekeeper.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Ah, I see what you mean, right. So, you don't have a housekeeper.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No more staff, no, but a woman Fenya, this woman who didn't sleep-in but always come in to work. She kept on coming to clean up the apartment.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And, that was okay?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was still okay, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, who started cooking, your mother?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Good question. I remember one incident -- no, I think it was Stepha, no, Fenya who did some of the cooking, but I remember one incident in the morning when we lived in the new apartment, and I had to go to school, my mother would prepare the breakfast for me and said, "Let's do it very, very quickly, and we'll eat in the kitchen." And, I said to her, "I'm not a maid."</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, I said to her, and I remember that very distinctly, and my mother reminded me of this after the war. It seemed funny to eat in the kitchen, and this brings back a very funny story.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. "Eat in the kitchen? For this I should move to America?"</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Funny.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, and that reminded me of my little incident.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes, and you were a kid?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was a kid, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. So is there a significant change when you had to move to the smaller apartment, or do things pretty much stay okay?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, it was much, much smaller the apartment. My father was working. He saw private patients, but could not use his X-rays or his laboratory, et cetera. That was all gone. Did we starve? Food became more scarce. Let's say a person could not buy more than, let's say a pound of sugar per month. I'm thinking of an arbitrary-</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -figure, but I do remember if we wanted to have meat, it also became scarce, and our new apartment was not far from the marketplace, and every person could buy so much and so much meat. So, I went online to buy a pound or a kilo or half a kilo, I don't remember, and I paid. So, we had -- and, my mother went online. So, that between the two of us, we were able to buy enough for a sumptuous meal. To give you just one idea.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, there wasn't a restriction in terms of a family. It was a restriction per person.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was. I remember this very distinctly, yes, per person. So, therefore, my mother went probably an hour later or so, and I went at nine. I don't know what time it was, at ten or she went at twelve, whatever.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But, none of these restrictions were because you were Jewish?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, everybody's in the same situation, yes. Everybody was in the same situation.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, are you beginning -- forget the Jewishness part for a moment -- but, are you beginning to feel the harshness of what war means, and what occupation means, or is this you think because they're communists and so-</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They're communists and we were vitriolicly anti-communist, and in my class, almost everyone joined the Communist Pioneers. I did not because we belonged to the "Bourgeois Class" and we were -- the class was being lambasted all the time. And, we were scared, but nothing seemed to happen, nothing happened until one week before the outbreak of the war.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In 1941?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: deg41, exactly one week before the outbreak of the war, on Sunday, suddenly Russian trucks appeared all over the city telling you you have to pack your things and leave.</p><p>We'll take you to Russia. We didn't know whether we would be taken, too, but a lot of the well-to-do people, a lot of the Jews, also Latvians, but proportionally more Jews than Latvians, were taken and shipped off to Siberia and to that part of the world in cattle cars, and this was just one week, exactly the Sunday before the outbreak of the war between Russia and Germany.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, when you say that you were -- and I'm assuming you mean the family -- was vitriolicly anti-Communist, is that what you believed about the Communists or is that because the Communists saw you as Bourgeois and would not accept you? Or, was it both?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think it was both. I think it was both. Again, I can't be a hundred percent certain, but I just know we were anti-Communist, and it was my decision not to join the youth movement. Again, my parents didn't say anything that I had to or so. My father felt probably significantly secure again because of his specialty as a gastroenterologist, not to be too worried, but still, and also the fact that he had prominent Russians now from the Russian Army and the Russian Navy as patients.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And, let me ask you something -- is part of the reason also that you didn't want to join not just ideological but the fact that they were also very disciplined and you were going to be indoctrinated on certain things, or you just didn't agree with them?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I just didn't agree with them, and I didn't -- at that time, I tried to intuit myself into that situation. At that time, I simply thought that Communism was wrong. Why? I don't know.</p></p></dialogue>

Of course, we were chased out of our apartment, but in contrast to the other ones, we were permitted to stay there another month or two, but I do remember my mother complaining, "How are we ever going to live in a six room apartment?"</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. That included a kitchen, right? (laughs)</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was the library, living room, dining room, two bedrooms, I had to double up with my brother, and in order to get into the -- not into the, we had different -- the toilet was in a different part of the apartment from the bathroom, and my parents to take a bath, they had to go through our bedroom, my brother's and my bedroom.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, so, actually to us, the library, living room, dining room, two bedrooms -- five, and there was a kitchen -- six, and the maid's room, actually seven, seven rooms, but it was -- and the rooms were much smaller than we had originally. A little footnote about this. I was persuaded by -- I don't know if the name means anything -- Per Ahlmark, Per Ahlmark former Deputy Prime Minister of Sweden, played a very big role in Jewish life since the "70s, "80s -- very pro-Israel, very pro-Jewish, convinced Elie to go back to and accompanied Elie to and wrote about it for the <span class="page-break" number="25"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 8 here in order to see Berlin." My father had lived in Berlin because he had studied there. "I want to see Berlin. I go by bus." My aunt said, "But you have my car with a driver. What's the matter with you, Clara?" My mother said, "No, I am going to go in the subway. I am going to go in the elevator. I'm going to go in the buses. I want" She looked at her as if she was crazy, and it turned out later on, and my aunt told me that my mother knew Berlin better than she knew it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: She did.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, because this aunt had survived and died in Riga about 20 years ago.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But, your memory of some of the details of what an apartment looks like is -- I don't know. It doesn't seem typical to me that you as such a young child would have such very vivid memory of these rooms and the layout.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's really something.</p></p></dialogue>

He has been with me.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: 1990 was the first time, yes, and I think we had sent you some -- Sheila sent you some material on this.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: George, just to go back for a moment, you've referred to someone named Elie quite often. So, | assume you're meaning Elie Wiesel</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Correct, Elie Wiesel.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Because otherwise some people may not know who it is. Did you go to school when the Russians were occupying?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> A Yes, and it was for one year, but I still went to school, and that's when I really failed all the subjects.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, that's when you failed?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, and war was kind of a relief for me when it broke out. The first thing that came to my mind is, "I will no longer have to go to school."</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: To school.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. Wait a second. Yeah, that was the year.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That was the year.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was the year.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did your father have to acquire some military status during this period of time when the Russians came?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> A Not in uniform, but when the war broke out, we could not run to Russia because it would have been considered desertion. It was considered that he had to be on the spot for his duties.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, does this mean that when people were told they could leave Latvia a couple of weeks or a week before-</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, the week before the outbreak of the war, these were the so-called "mass deportations"</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You could've left then?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: With the mass deportations? No.</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. These were forced deportations. The trucks arrived. "Family X -- we're looking for A, B, C, D-- Family X you have to be packed what you can carry with you in two hours, and we're taking you to Russia to work, work camp. You're a Bourgeoisie.</p><p>That is you belong to the Bourgeois class." And, that was that. And, proportionally many more Jews were sent out than Latvians because he Jews were in certain of the professions, and also in many of the businesses.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see, and that was your father's status as being a doctor?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was our interpretation at the time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was our interpretation.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And, what is the major religion in Latvia.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Lutheran.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Lutheran?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Huh. Now, is your brother taken in to be part of the army? I mean, he's now what 18 years, 19 years old?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He just graduated gymnasium, and before the war the talk was after he would graduate gymnasium, of course, you couldn't send him to Germany to study at the university. So, they were going to send him to England. Why to England especially Cambridge? Chemistry. He had some inclination in that direction. So, they figured that he would end up in England studying Chemistry. My mother later on told me that before Hitler came to power, it was assumed that we would -- the kids -- would study at one of the German universities.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Isee.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But, certainly, England, the talk of England came in only later on when Hitler was already in power that they would not be able to send him to study in Germany.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, during the Russian occupation, though, your father isn't earning a lot of money, really. The money that he has possessed, that the family had, was not confiscated as far as you know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And, we were able to exchange some of it into Rubles, but there were price controls in the Russian period. So, if you made 30 Rubles, you had to pay the rent maybe with three Rubles or four Rubles, but money was not an issue and wasn't -- and I remember the snickers about the 30 Rubles that he was making, or 35 Rubles perhaps, but it was very low. It was in the 30s I remember, but it didn't matter to us personally.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. So, are you -- is there any apprehension that there's going to be a war coming to Latvia, that the Germans will do something that this won't stay-</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no because according to the Ribbentrop Molotov Pact, Latvia and Estonia and a good part of Lithuania fell under the Russian sphere of influence and subsequently occupation, and that Germans would not dare attack Russia. This behemoth for as long as the war still is going on in the West. So, there were no fears of war.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, this deportation, this mass forced deportation, you think it had nothing to do with the Russians thinking there's going to be a war. They just did it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's a very good question, and that's still being speculated about. Stalin and Molotov were convinced, and I'm not talking now as a child. I'm talking about with my knowledge as an academic, where convinced that there would be no war with Russia -- with Germany at this time. The lower downs believed that there will be because the Germans were sending spy planes all the time. In fact, the week before -- two weeks before the outbreak or three weeks before the outbreak, we could see planes very, very high up.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And, could you see them?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You could?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You could see them, yes which we assumed were not Russian planes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But, nevertheless, you weren't -- the people you were around were not suspicious.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>You wouldn't be.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You were too young.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We were not suspicious. That was elsewhere, the war, not -- it would not come to the Baltics. We did not like the Russians, but in comparison, of course, the Russians were the lesser evils.</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: They still were the lesser evils even to you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. Well, the point is, later on in comparison to the Nazis.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Ah, okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, but we were, the family was together. We really did not starve. We were not sent out. Friends of ours were deported, yes, but my aunts and uncles in Riga were not deported. So, by and large, by and large, we were satisfied. Of course, the press was a controlled press. My parents now spoke much more often in Russian in front of me for fear that I should not go to school and say something anti-Communist, and then be arrested because a child had said something. I sensed it of course, and I resented the fact that my parents did not trust me, and that was probably one of the reasons I did not join the Russian Youth Movement, the Young Pioneers because everything was now hush-hush at home for fear that I may squeal because I was a child.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. So, you think you didn't join partly because you felt?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, because I was vitriolicly anti-Communist like my parents, and I sensed it at home, what I overheard, what I understood from their Russian, et cetera, I kept my mouth shut, but nevertheless, they had to be cautious. I understand. I understand it now. I didn't understand it at the time obviously.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, what language were you speaking in primarily now since before the Russians come you're speaking primarily German.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I continued to speak German with my parents, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You did? With you parents?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And in the street, with the kids?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was Latvian.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was it Latvian?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And, could you speak a little Russian with the Russian soldiers that you-</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And, this is not a harsh occupation except for the forced? Or was it a harsh, maybe it was?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't think it was a harsh occupation before the deportations. Freedom of the press, of course, was curtailed. Harsh from the viewpoint of physical harm, no, until the deportation, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I've read that people were arrested for anti-Communist, anti-Bolshevik statements, so on and so forth. Yes, we heard about this, but the immediate circle, our immediate circle, as I understood it at the time, was not affected.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Something radically different happens in 1941, however.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember the move into Latvia by the Germans?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Very well, I remember the outbreak of the war very well. Actually, what happened, the war, the Germans invaded on a Sunday morning, early morning. Saturday night, my parents went to sleep only at three or four because they played cards at our house.</p><p>There were about six or seven ladies played Gin Rummy, I mean Kunken, and suddenly early in the morning, there was lots of noise, bombs being dropped et cetera on that Sunday morning, June 22", of 41, and now we had a terrace in the rear, a balcony not a terrace, actually only a balcony. And, we all went out to see what happened, and we saw German planes, , flying very low where we could even <span class="page-break" number="31"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 4 being bombarded by the German Navy and subsequently by the Army. So, we moved to the larger hospital outside the city -- well, it still was in the city district, but in the residential area right near the beach, and I distinctly remember when the Germans arrived, the Latvian doctors asked my father to accompany them to "welcome the Germans" with roses, et cetera, and my father went and asked about the Jews and the Lieutenant in the car, and I remember him coming back saying the Jews have nothing to worry about. We now have a common foe, and we must fight this common foe and the Jews are part of this war. In the naivety, fighting if you fight together we're civilized Germans, not racists, et cetera. Like in World War I, if you fight Communism, fine and good, and he was sort of assured, and in a certain naivety, he believed and made us rather believe that we have nothing to worry about, or maybe he just wanted to keep us calm as could be the case.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, how did you feel that he asked the Germans this question?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He came back.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And he told you what he asked them?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, he told us and my brother, my mother and me et cetera, yes, and we all listened, et cetera. There was a kind of a command car that appeared and he was part of the welcoming committee that he was asked to participate, and in this context he asked about the Jewish question, and he was assured by this officer.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That everything would be okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That, Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Is this as if your father either knew nothing or paid no attention to what was happening to Jews in Germany? Did you have any idea?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Originally, I'm convinced. Again, this is my interpretation that he did not genuinely believe my aunt when she said-</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What had happened.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -what had happened with the Germans with the Jewish women polishing the cars with furs. Later on, my interpretation again, is that he did not want to worry the family. So, he always looked at the glass half full rather than half empty. That's my interpretation.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Is it possible that he never asked the Germans this? He simply told you this so you'd feel okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I would -- it could very well be the case. It could very well be the case, and then afterwards the same day, we took our baggage and we walked back to the apartment,</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

We left them alone. I remember staring at them, and then we went back to the apartment.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The same apartment, the smaller apartment?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, but in the meantime we had also heard that a number of Jews were shot by Latvians because the Latvians were also vitriolicly anti-Communist, and in some of the German propaganda that leaked through, I guess, the Germans equated Bolshevism with Judaism so on and so forth. So, apparently, some people were shot even before, just before the German occupation took place in Libau.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, how long is it when things become rougher and it's no longer the same life for you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Almost immediately.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Almost immediately?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Almost immediately. I remember my father having to go to a gathering place every morning to be assigned for work. My father wore his red cross arm band. My brother going to work. A cousin of mine was shot dead by the Germans apparently, he had just married a Latvian girl before. She was pregnant, but I was lead to understand that she also had a lover, and I was lead to understand that she denounced him as a Jew and he was shot and my father was called on to go to the cemetery to identify the body, and he came back to the house and I was there, pale saying, "Yes it was <span class="page-break" number="33"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 6</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. Nine and a half at the time now.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, the quick relief of "I don't have to go to school."</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, that-</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was all finished.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was finished. That was finished, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, do you have trouble sleeping now when you're-</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Now?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No, I don't mean now. I'm sorry, now meaning at the point.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: At the point, I don't remember having trouble sleeping. I slept. I lead an active life in so far as I kept up with the news, the latest news, what's happening all the gossip, the dangers, by the time the evening came around, I assume I was exhausted. I was still a kid. So, I seemed to sleep very well. My mother was assigned to go to work, and sometimes she was able to take me with her. This was she was kind of a seamstress, ironing. I remember her doing working in, I guess it must have been a laundry. If I think of it today, for the German Air Force in Libau. She was, and then at a certain point, she became the housekeeper, maid for the mistress, for the Latvian mistress for the head of the in Libau, and my mother knew her from before the war because <span class="page-break" number="34"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 7 of the Latvian doctors, I guess you know jealousy, professional jealousy whatever, but nothing unusual.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. Then, how do you understand death and murder?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I didn't analyze it. I did not, but I remember later on thinking -- initially, I did not want to die, but later on after Stalingrad, et cetera, I did not mind. I thought myself because I know that the Germans are going to be defeated.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, you didn't mind the thought that you might die?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, I did no longer mind it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Isee.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: To see Germany destroyed, that was it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. Because I remember in the severe winter, well -- I remember in maybe it's later it's been cut now.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No, you have another minute.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> A I remember it was a very severe winter, 1941-42, where I got frostbite in Libau, frostbite on my toes and my fingers, thinking perhaps if the Germans would win the war, there would no longer be a reason to punish Jews for whatever reason, and things would get better. So, for a moment, I even thought, however perverse it may sound today, but as a child, perhaps the Germans should win and then we will be relieved of this misery, of this uncertainty.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, he went to work to the gathering place in Libau where the Jews were gathered and then the Germans would transport them to their outfits, and he saw the trucks approaching, and he began to make signs to the people on the square, in other words, to disperse, and this was noticed by the SS people, and they beat him up terribly and threw him onto one of the trucks, and he among others were taken to the prison. That's where he continued to be tortured. That's where apparently his eye was knocked out, and apparently he was going around looking for his eye, et cetera, and couldn't find it, and begged -- this is from eye witnesses that we have -- begged to be shot, but they kept him alive.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: She relied heavily on my older brother who had leadership qualities which she did not really, nor of course I, as a child.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, your mother has a couple of jobs, and are you still living in that smaller apartment?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, in the meantime, several times we had to move. We moved in to one apartment near my school for a short time. Let me get the sequence straight. Oh, my -- we moved into the servant quarters of the Kessel Villa, K-e-s-s-e-1, because my brother married the daughter, but this was already a war marriage, had no legal validity to the best of my knowledge. So, the front part was occupied, the main part of the villa was occupied by Mrs. Stein who was Latvian. Her husband was Jewish. So, she lived there with a daughter, and Mr. Stein, the Kessel's -- the husband was already killed, Mrs. Kessel and her two daughters, and my brother and I and my mother, we lived behind the building what used to be known as the servant's quarters. We lived there for a while until we had to move from there and moved to another quarter which was near my school where we were in three rooms -- one, two, three. We were one -- my brother and his newly acquired wife, myself -- we lived, slept in one room. My mother slept in another room, another woman -- Mrs. Boop slept in a room that was in Mrs.</p><p>Boop's apartment. Yes, she was killed during the war, and two young women slept in another room. So we were about six or seven people in this small apartment of about four or five rooms, excluding the kitchen. And, from there, well an announcement came that we will be moved to a ghetto -- we'll have to move to a ghetto which is ina part of Libau, a section of Libau that I did not know very well, and there in the ghetto this was in the summer of "43, we were assigned to a flat in a basement that had a kind of an outhouse, the toilet was a few steps -- we had to go about five or six steps, right off the entrance, rear entrance of the building, and there including the kitchen there were one, two, three rooms. So, two rooms and where people could sleep. In these two rooms, my brother and his wife, and my mother and I slept, in this basement apartment, and in the other room there were about four people who slept, and we shared the same toilet. We shared the bathroom, the bathing facilities, and we made the best of this situation. I was working for a while in the ghetto in the garden, vegetable garden, and then I was "asked, invited" to become the commandant's runner in the Libau ghetto. The commandant was not a bad person actually, Kerscher.</p><p>He closed his eyes to many things especially when people brought in some extra food to the ghetto. He did not make a big deal out of it, but of course, we also managed to give him things that is not only the Schwabs but other people with means before the war who had saved a gold coin here, a diamond there, a fur coat, whatever, gave it to</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

This in order to try to release Jews from the prison to bribe the Germans, et cetera. So, this was -- I remember people coming around for specific arrests that were made and collecting, because we were told if we gathered this and this and this and this, we would be able to get that person out of prison and so on and so forth. But, this brings me back to before the ghetto, way before the ghetto.</p><p>Immediately after the revolution in 1917, Lenin needed hard currency, and opened up the palaces. You could buy everything and anything for very little money. And, we had antique -- an antique for example living room that came from one of the Czarist palaces. We had a chandelier a cobalt with gold chandelier that came from one of the palaces that my grandparents bought and some of it gave to my father as a gift after World War I, immediately, and some that my father bought including some art works from famous Russian artists that he bought when he was serving in Russia, and right after the revolution that he bought and brought it back to Latvia. So, in addition to the Persian carpets and the Grand piano, et cetera, this was very exclusive furniture that we had from Czarist palaces including a number of chandeliers. I remember two in particular, and all this was taken by the Germans before we came even to the ghetto.</p><p>And, not only the German , but also the German Navy.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You couldn't mourn in the sense in those days you would wear black for a whole year, et cetera. This you couldn't do. There was no way of doing it. You had to go in the morning to work whatever, and then they would come back and in the evening hoping to find me still there, alive, et cetera. So-</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: There's no way to do that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I don't remember -- we didn't even know exactly the date, but this was irrelevant, but I don't remember a Shiva.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And, do you remember yourself responding in way like your mother because you lost your father, or did you not understand what it really meant to lose your father?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I understood. I missed him very much, but I didn't understand what it meant that he was shot, but then I had some sort of an inkling because when he came home from the cemetery where he identified my cousin that the person was suddenly dead, and my father was arrested. What I couldn't understand is that I'll never see him again. This I do remember, that I may never see him again. This I do remember very, very distinctly, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did you -- was there a notice to go into the ghetto?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, do you even as a child begin to feel that your life is getting more and more constricted, or you have no-</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yes, not only this, but I was at a certain point coming to this, even going back before the ghetto when we had to wear the yellow star and had to deliver our radios and other things right after the occupation, and we were not permitted to go on the sidewalks as Jews. We could only go right off the sidewalk, and I remember it was in the winter, going and a fellow student, a girl, came in my direction. We were in the same class, and we walked and I wanted to say hello to her, and it happened to be a girl I fancied as a child. Veltina was her name. She sort of looked away, and I felt embarrassed that I was a Jew, that I had to wear this and I could not go on the sidewalk. It was something strange. Why should I feel embarrassed? But, I remember feeling embarrassed that I am who I am. It's a very strange sensation that I had, just as strange as the same winter when I thought maybe a German victory would be helpful to us. Let the Germans win. Logical, perhaps for a child, but for an adult, obviously not.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you ever say anything to your mother or your brother that you were embarrassed, felt ashamed?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not in this context, in a different context. The children in the ghetto didn't like to play with me because I didn't speak Yiddish. I spoke German, and they used to call me kind of a yeke. I did not speak it, and I remember going to my mother crying saying, "The children don't want to play with me because I don't speak Yiddish", and I remember my mother saying to me, "George, there's really nothing I can do about it.</p><p>I don't speak Yiddish either. We have to make the best of the situation." And, it is in this context that I began to acquire Yiddish because this became the lingual the <span class="page-break" number="41"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 5</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The Jews that you are meeting in the ghetto, were they not of your economic class because the Russians had sent out most of the Bourgeois?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They didn't send out most of the Bourgeois. They sent out a good number, but I assume, but in those days I didn't think in terms of classes, et cetera. I didn't think in terms -- I didn't think in these terms, but in retrospect, I would say that they came from a milieu from which I did not come, period. I mean, that's how I would put it now.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And, did that make you feel uncomfortable because they were so dissimilar in terms of background?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I felt -- I felt bad that they would not accept me and at the same time, I was envious because they were stronger than I was. They were better athletes than I was.</p><p>In many ways, they were far superior to me. So, I was envious actually, and they spoke Yiddish which I did not. So, I was envious too. But, as a child, you can acquire language very easily. So-</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, how quickly did you acquire Yiddish?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I guess I still probably have a vocabulary of about 150 or 200 words. So, I could get by. In other words, with my limited vocabulary, I could get by, and but also interesting because the Yiddish we speak in the Baltic countries is different from the Polish Yiddish. For example, I'm now the Vice President of the Sholom Aleichem Foundation even though my Yiddish is almost non-existent as is Belle Kaufman's Yiddish almost non-existent, the granddaughter of Sholom Aleichem, who is still alive at 93 and is our Chairman. When we have the annual meetings of the Sholom Aleichem meetings in New York commemorating his death because it's according to his will, when some of the Yiddish actors read his writings in the Polish Yiddish especially in the .

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: George, let me just go way back for a second just so we get a context for your family.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>I assume that your father did not become very wealthy because he was a doctor in Lativa, that there was money in the family before.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, there was money in the family before, but he also did very well, and I remember my mother telling me that he would come home and take out from his pockets lots of money saying, "You have brought me a lot of luck, Clairehen, Claire. Look how well I'm doing in my practice." So, independently of his parents, but my grandfather was a big merchant in the grains -- import and export -- and, we had at least one warehouse that I was aware of with elevators in front of it, railroad tracks, right at the pier, because he exported a lot to England and elsewhere, but one of my relatives told me that we had another warehouse on the other side of the pier exactly facing it. This I don't know. Maybe they sold it very early on, but I only knew of the other one because it was not sold until the late "30s, the other one. So, maybe the first one they didn't bother talking about. But, I did not know until I heard about it over here that there was a second one. Also, to give you a little background, what I found out over here is that when the governor of St. Petersburg came to Libau, he would always come to Libau and play bridge with my grandfather, and they were very good friends, but I would think that the big money came from my grandfather. But, my father did very well in his practice, in his practice, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And, was your mother's family a well-to-do family also?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not as well-off as my father's family, but in the six sisters, three brothers, they all went to universities, the three brothers. The six sisters all went to gymnasium, and there you had to pay in those days and music conservatory. My grandfather owned an upscale delicatessen store, and my mother tells me he brought home the most delicious things everyday from the delicatessen something like _in Paris, and my grandmother, the big money apparently came from my grandmother who came from the Russian city of and her maiden name was .

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Interesting. It seemed important to get a bit of that background which we didn't get before. Now, let's go back to this not so great situation in the ghetto. How did you become a runner for the commandant? Do you know?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My German was good.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Clearly.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, it was my native tongue, maybe I don't know. It's an interpretation. Maybe this was one reason why I was "invited" to become his runner. A second reason perhaps, it's my interpretation again is because I came from a certain background. I don't know if this played a role, but in addition to being a runner for him - when I would have to, when I would get a pass that nothing should happen to me while I brng a watch which was repaired in the ghetto to, let's say to or to SS who <span class="page-break" number="45"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 9 father, et cetera. So, in the circumstances, I -- I still felt "good that I had my brother and my mother".</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When you picture being in the ghetto in that period of time, do you remember whether people who -- how were people with each other?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I must say that with very few exceptions, they were very civil, very polite, but this was our general upbringing in Libau. Later on, I met types I never met before, but in Libau, I had not met types, such types before. So, among ourselves, we were very polite. We were very well behaved to the best of our ability, and this goes also for the "less fortunate" people because I think that even the less fortunate people before the war, there was a common level of behavior that embraced the, I would say, what I knew of the Jewish community, but as I proven wrong about saying that there were no poor Jews in Latvia, maybe I just didn't was not in touch with other elements. But, after the war and during the war when I spent with many of them from many other levels, I would say that there was very civilized and -- under the worse circumstances- civilized and cultured approach to things, to human beings, to fellow human beings, et cetera. You rarely heard of a Libau Jew stealing something from another Libau Jew, rarely. There were exceptions, and they were caught ant they were punished.</p><p>This even went on later when we were in the concentration camp. Among ourselves we were very civil, and it didn't matter whether -- from which class you came. At least, I had not encountered this, and I'm speaking now - strictly speaking from my perspective.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And, what rumors are you hearing about what's going on? Through 1942, there's a huge number of Jews between "41 and the end of 42 that are killed that are massacred.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes, we heard vague stories, but we did not know details, but what we did know, there were technicians among the former Libau Jews who were technicians already then, and they managed some way or other to construct a radio. So, we knew what was going on in the world. We heard about the German defeats at the front, which was wonderful news to us and gave us inspiration, and when we didn't hear good news or anything, we used to talk about the one says rumors. Rumors about his, et cetera.

What did I feel? The essential thing in "42-"43 when we were in the ghetto. It was a, relatively speaking, stable period. We came in 800 some odd people, and we were taken to the concentration camp, roughly the same number. So, there were few killings between the period between the time we got into the ghetto and went to Riga Kaiserwald to the concentration camp, but it was still the fear everyday.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You don't know what to expect, and you always had to be on the lookout, and incidentally, something very interesting. Across the street from one of the streets in the ghetto, you had buildings where there were lots and lots of Russian POWs, and they were begging for bread. They had it much worse than we, and we were able to throw them some bread because in the ghetto we still did not really starve.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I was going to ask you that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, we really did not, at least, I don't think we starved, no because from with our Latvian people, we could deal for this. We could get that, and we still had a diamond here, a dollar there, so on and so forth. We could still do business, so to speak. We could still bring in. So, I do not really remember starving. That we had our pre-World War food obviously is not the case or even the food that we had during the Russian period, but we had enough bread. We had some butter. We had sometimes a piece of salami. We had even sometimes I got hot chocolate. So, I don't remember starving in the ghetto, let's put it this way.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I didn't think in these terms that I've lost my childhood. At that age, I don't think that you think along these lines, but what is interesting, I think, and I often think about it, how I survived because later on I had to witness hangings so on and so forth because I've never really seen anybody hang, but this goes to late deg44 early deg45 in Stolp</p><p> .

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. Most of the others were sent to the Riga concentration camp, Yom Kippur at night, 1943, and we were taken to the cargo terminal and in cattle cars we were shoved in and interestingly, we were told we were going to Riga. And, Riga just rang a bell, something clicked. I loved Riga before the war.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: George, can you tell us what it was that you brought with you? Did you have luggage? Did you have special clothes?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We were told that we could take with us what we could carry. So, I still -- we still had our pre-war clothes. We were dressed warmly.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was it cold?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: October, it was beginning to get cold, yes. So, we were always prepared. I remember mother saying it's better warmer because we could always take off. So, we were very warmly dressed. We each had a suitcase and some other things so on and so forth. So, we were transported, and I remember we arrived in Riga. It was still dark, probably very early in the morning next day. Suddenly, the doors were slid open. SS men beginning to scream and also some of the non-Jewish prisoners in very strange garb, namely in concentration camp garb screaming, "Out, out with you dirty Jews, out!" And, beating us, beating us like crazy, and then we had to run from -- which wasn't very far, maybe fifty or sixty yards -- to the camp from the railroad track. And, there we were told to throw all the luggage and to take off the coat, and throw it on a pile, and my mother didn't want to do it, and I remember saying to my mother, "But, mother we're told that we're going to get it back. So, let's put it there." What do you expect of an eleven year old kid? That's what we were told, and I believed. So, reluctantly, my mother and my brother also took off the coat, and inside of course, were diamonds and some gold coins whatever. And, needless to say, we never saw the coats again. Then we were chased into a barrack, and next day, we were "deloused" but we didn't have any lice in Libau, and we went through a shower, and coming out of the shower, we no longer had our old clothes. We were given new clothes that didn't fit me. I got a coat that came down to here. I received some wooden shoes. What do they call them?</p></p></dialogue>

The beatings, the screamings, Appel, for the first time I heard the word Appel, the count, in the morning, and to make sure that I look older, et cetera, at the count, I always scratched together the sand and stood on my toes to be taller than usual. So, and I was a little bit taller than the rest of the kids in my age group. That was probably one of the reasons why I was not immediately selected for being shot. My brother after a few days was taken to a kaisernierung, to a camp outside the camp where he worked in their reichsbarn which had happened to be a very good kaisernierung. The people were treated relatively well. My mother was assigned to a job in the concentration camp, in the tanklager, and sometimes she managed to convince, I don't know how that I go with her to the tanklager, not to remain in camp because if you remain in camp you never know what can happen. There were safer days. There were less safer days. It was a very, very severe winter, the winter of 43 again in "44, and we were working on this tanklager again, in constructing railroad trucks, and there were a lot of the-</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Railroad tracks?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, railroad tracks, sorry, tracks because it was -- you had a lot of gasoline storage et cetera, and trains came in where you loaded the gasoline, et cetera, for the Air Force, for the Navy et cetera, and so it was a storage, a dump, and also part of the tanklager was also a repair shop for German cars or whatever, but I was working a lot outside building and repairing of the tracks, railroad tracks.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Is this when you were still in Kaiserwald or when you joined your brother?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, that's still in Kaiserwald. I did not join my brother until probably it was, must have been November or so.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was together with my brother for the first three days until he was taken to this kaisernierung and I was alone. My mother was on the woman's side, and there was a fence between the woman's camp, but I could see my mother almost anytime -- in the morning before work or when she would come back because you could see the women's camp. It was just -- the distance was like from here to the camera. So, it's just a few feet.</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

<dialogue class=""><p><p> A Oh, across the fence.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And that was okay?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was okay. In the mornings, I remember I was starved all ready, but I didn't suffer all that much from hunger, but I remember I would say to my mother, "Momika, I'm so hungry." So, she would give me her portion. I said, "But, did you eat?" "Yes, yes, I am full." She would say, but she was not, but she threw me her portion because in the mornings we would receive moldy bread, some sugar, some kind of a marmalade, and this was very bad because -- this was bad because we all got diarrhea from it, and a kind of a coffee that didn't taste like coffee at least to me as a child. It was terrible, but it wasn't enough for me. So, I asked my mother, and she very often was able to throw me her portion, and I ate, and I remember at that time, there was a Mr. Kaufman who was a friend from before the war. And, I went to him and I said to him in German, "Mr. Kaufman, do you happen to have a slice of bread?</p><p>I'm very, very hungry." He said to me, "George, I wish I had I could give you, but I don't." And, I'll never forget this. He died in New York. He was the first chairman of the Jewish Survivors of Latvia, and he always remembered this, and I remember this particular incident as well. But, it was done still. It was still Herr Kaufman, Mr.</p><p>Kaufman that I addressed him. It was not Max or sort of the way we're accustomed to here. Yes, and then, interestingly enough in this Tanklager, which was a tough place, there was a German guard by the name of Hoffmann, the beast par excellence, beat the Jews like anything. He came I think from Romania or some place from that area, but he liked my mother, and would always address her as Frau Dr. Schwab, and when he was patrolling, he would say, "You can go into this shack" where there was a stove and what we confiscated. We used to call it organizier, we organized something. We stole something -- potatoes so we could slice and put it against the oven and roast potatoes. That became a delicacy. So, and he permitted me to go with my mother. So, we could go in. We could warm-up, et cetera. We would have our potato so on and so forth. One day, we were marching toward the Tanklager again in the winter, and my mother told me she had a terrible case of diarrhea and she doesn't know what to do.</p><p> in German. She went over to him and said, "I really have to step out."

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: She was asked?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, and there are other incidents like this after the war, immediately where people in Berlin did not think that she was Jewish because the way she looked when she came to look for me, but maybe when we go into this, we can discuss it later.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, is your brother living in this outer camp?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, he was living in this outer camp, and sometimes there was communication and youcould _ had little pieces of paper or whatever, and you could communicate.</p><p>And, he communicated with my mother that it is possible to bribe the commandant Kohler of the reichsbahn where my brother was at to bring her and me to the reichsbahn, and my mother said yes she is going to send for some gold coins and fur coats. It was something in because certain of the things we managed to give to a Latvian patient of my father's who was a head of a bank by the name of Abelit. His name was Abelit, and he did come through, this Abelit, and sent the things to Kohler and Kohler instructed my brother to get a message to me that I should be in the camp on those three days and he will send a car for me. And, indeed, but not for my mother, but for me. And, my mother said, "Absolutely you go. It's ___ and don't worry about me. I'll be all right." So, I went and joined my brother, but I was not the only one in the car. There was apparently a few more who had similar deals because he could be bribed. He was one who could be bribed. And, then my mother, we learned later, also went to an out camp to work camp called the SS , the SS vegetable garden <span class="page-break" number="56"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 0</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And, the commandant, you could -- you could talk to him. He could also scream.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You could scream?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He could scream.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: He could scream.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: He could scream, yes, but by and large, I don't remember major beatings or so, for example in the Kaiserwald, I remember having received once a smack in my face from the commandant Oberstrumbahnfuhrer Sauer. I saw stars in front of me. I was supposed to clear the snow from the walkway, and I perhaps didn't do it as quickly.</p><p>So, he came out and said to me, "Hey, you Jew boy, why aren't you working?" I said, "Tm working," And, he slapped me. I fell maybe ten feet away from the slap, and I just stars in front of my eyes. This did not -- was not the case in the reichsbahn, and in the reichsbahn what was my task, I began to "help my brother" he was an auto electrician. He knew about a car electrician as much as I know about the Chinese language, and I was his assistant, and what we did, what we all did for example when we had to screw in something, we would screw it in not all the way. It was our way of, "sabotaging" the German war effort. We would always try to do things not a hundred percent, eighty percent. Hopefully, something will go wrong. But, when an SS man would come, and inspect, go around the big halls and inspect somebody would scream out 5 meant six.

And suddenly, we knew that the Russians were advancing in the direction of Riga in the late spring of 1944. Suddenly, we come to the camp, return from our work which was only may about 200 yards from where we were living, and that we all had to appear at an .

My mother's voice. She was looking down. She was without hair. They had taken her and shaved her hair, and there was my mother. So, for the next three days we could see each other on the ship, and the interesting thing is that while we were going through the bay of Riga, the Russians were shooting at the ship, but missing us by a hundred or two hundred yards, and we just sailed through it, and the artillery shells would fall, go over the ship, fall on the other side maybe a couple of hundred yards from it, and we finally arrived near Danzig. We were put on the little railroad cars. What do they call them? The schmalspurbahn, the German. It's not the regular, it's-</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were they half cars?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Half cars, and not as wide. The railroad tracks were not as wide -- lorries, kind of lorries, it's almost a sort of a choo-choo train, et cetera. So, we were transported to Stutthof in August. That was Kaiserwald, however bad it was, was paradise in comparison to Stutthof. We were beaten. We had to work also on the railroad tracks over there, not far from the gas chamber and crematorium we saw. We already knew what it was. The chimney burning all the time, burning the bodies. So, we knew and the issue was how to survive there. Food was almost non-existent. We were all emaciated. We were all starving, but and I no longer saw my mother. I no longer saw my mother.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: George, we ended with your saying that you no longer were able to see your mother and coming into Stutthof, the Kaiserwald was paradise in comparison with Stutthof.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>So, could you explain what was going on?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, the beatings were almost non-stop now. The food was even worse than in Kaiserwald. When we worked on the tracks, we were beaten all the time by the Germans and by the non-Jewish couples, even though I learned what a louse means in Kaiserwald, and began the practice of delousing myself --- the hair and over here and so call in the garb that we had. Now, we were full of lice in Stutthof. The facilities were terrible. Sanitary facilities in Kaiserwald were also bad. For example, the toilet was a kind of an outhouse. It was a square pit, and was -- on top of this what was constructed were columns. Columns was a wooden "bench" maybe six or eight inches and you would have to lift yourself up, that I never fell into the pit was a miracle, and incidentally, there were some kapos that were so bad that they were thrown into the pit by the Jews, non-Jewish couples. But, in Stutthof it all over shadowed Kaiserwald from every point of view, especially the beatings. Now, the interesting part was that the reichsbahn requested that the same people be spent to Stolp. So, I was part of it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, you got out of -</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: First of all, they would slap you, but then they also had whips -- whips. They would beat you like you would beat a wild horse when you want them to run or something to that effect. It didn't matter if you were young or old, et cetera, and the infirm were immediately taken after the appel to be shot, cremated.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And, how were you strong enough to withstand this kind of treatment?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I always made myself older, and I always made myself taller, and this was street smartness in a sense. Now, why was my brother taken?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And, not you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And, not me. Again, I resorted to the same tactic, but my brother used eyeglasses, and anybody who needed eye et cetera was already concerned infirmed, which we did not know, or he would've hidden the eyeglasses. So, he was taken. I did not need eyeglasses. Yes, I was emaciated, but everyone was emaciated, and however much I suffered from hunger pains, I suffered less than others because my father as a gastroenterologist, et cetera never permitted us to eat huge portions of anything, never permitted us too much, too many of the fatty things.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In passenger cars, railroad cars.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Passenger cars?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, and the feeling was that the Nazis didn't want to show to their own people that you transport prisoners -- this was our interpretation -- prisoners in cattle cars. That was our interpretation. Whether this is true or not, I don't know. And, that turned out to be a work camp, living right on the premises in the reichsbahn right near the railroad, the main railroad station there. There I became a carpenter, and I know as much about carpentry as I know about Chinese hieroglyphics. That I didn't chop off a finger or something or other is still one of those miracles because I have no sense for these things.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, what was your job?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Helping to repair cattle cars, transportation, et cetera. Sometimes you needed a board, so you had to do this. You do that. Don't ask me what somehow or another, and managed to do what was expected.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You weren't building furniture.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> A No, no, no I wasn't building furniture. I was not an artist, along those lines. No. I was a plain, plain worker.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The food was manageable over there, and people who worked right near the tracks were able to organize sometimes potatoes, carrots, because they would fall off from the railroad tracks and smuggled into the camps and you could begin to trade a little bit here and there. So, you could augment the poor food that we got with some of the extras, but a few months later, some people did the same thing, organize some food, and they were caught by the Germans. And, now, the Germans wanted to teach us a lesson that theft is punishable. And, what they did was hang the people, and we were forced to march to see the hanging, and then march around the hangers to see them.</p><p>How did I survive this one? When it was announced hanging people, I didn't understand what it means, how a person can hang. Again, it became interesting to me to look at the person hanging. I didn't understand that this is involved with death. I did not put two and two together. How can a person hang? And, only while hanging did I realize that the person was hanged and it meant actual death. I did not connect this before. So, to me again, it was a kind of a spectacle. Theater of the Absurd, if you want to call it, or something along those lines. Sick! But I remember the context very well because I think about it and how could I have reacted the way I reacted? And, my answer is, folly of youth, did not understand, and number two, and perhaps even</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And, this happened three, four months before our liberation when the Russians were already on German soil, and also during this period in Stolp, the German Jewish couples began to behave atrociously to the Eastern European Jews. When somebody was caught organizing something internally or so, he had to receive twenty lashes, and the German Jewish couples were only delighted to mete out the punishment. One of them was Kentcourik who was particularly brutal. For some reason or other, both of these couples Greenwald and Kentcourik liked me, maybe because I spoke their type of German, and left me pretty much alone this and that and were actually nice, but they were absolute -- excuse me for using the term here -- bastards. And, I'm jumping now forward for a minute. I was in the same hospital, after, right after the war as Kentcourik, and I came out of the hospital and was brought back by the British to the rehabilitation, to the rehabilitation barrack in the DP camp in Neustadt in Holstein with one of the British Red Cross cars, ambulance cars, and Kentcourik -- I informed the other guys who were there, fellows, many of them that I was liberated with that Kentcourik was coming out. "Oh, Kentcourik is coming out. We" ll beat the hell out of him," and Kentcourik came in thinking that's he's coming in as a great hero, and chairs flew into his face, this and that, so on and so forth. He was taken back to the hospital seriously injured. He survived this, and after the war he had two daughters, moved with his two daughters to Lubeck where he died subsequently, but I don't remember what happened to his other one, Grunwald, but that was the fate of this German Jewish couple Kentcourik.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I've been thinking about it ever since this particular episode. Hanging, et cetera, and when I watch the History Channel, and I see some of the -- some of the things when Mussolini was hung with Clara Petacci, and how they used to hang Russian prisoners, the German and so on and so forth, this always comes back to me, this scene of how I had to watch these people being hanged.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Absolutely because I could be next. Yes, you never knew. Yeah, and, in Stolp I was sleeping in a bunk right next to Julius Goldberg. Again, everything straw, this and that, lice, delousing was an every evening activity. Bathroom facility better than Stutthof and Riga, but still -- there was water. You could wash yourself in the barrack which was a converted -- the barrack was actually not a true barrack. It was for a steam engine that was converted into a kind of a barrack where we could sleep, bunk beds. And, then, the Russians were coming very close and they were going to evacuate us, but before then, about the Bar Mitzvah. It was Eugenia Goldberg who was a nurse, and persuaded the SS woman to let her do something for me. And, she "baked" something from potatoes which was the most delicious thing I thought I'd ever eaten because I was so starved -- a kind of a potato pie. She explained it to Sheila Robbins, maybe she would be able to explain it to you what it was, and then the SS woman was present. I was permitted to come in from the man's quarter including Julius Goldberg, her husband.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, I guess it was, yes. It was my Bar Mitzvah I guess, end of 44. I'm confused with the dates sometimes a little because sometimes I was made older, sometimes I was made younger. So, I have to think about. It was nothing unusual in those circumstances.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But it was in Stolp</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was in Stolp, yes. Now, it was not long thereafter, a couple of months actually, I think it was in March, beginning of March or end of February when we were sort of dumped into cattle cars again, and we were returning to Stutthof But, because the Russians were already nearby and my mother was already liberated nearby which I didn't know. I found this out only after I met her, we spent about a week in these cattle cars with hardly any food, no facilities to speak of, in the corners we had where the stench was absolutely incredible. Finally, we came to Danzig and we didn't manage to get to Stutthof and we were brought to another small camp Burggraben, and we marched. It was a long march from Danzig to Burggraben. It was very cold, I remember. It was about easily, easily ten, twelve miles in our circumstance to march.</p><p>We arrived in Burggrabben. It was knee deep in mud. There were no German guards.</p><p>It was no man's land between the Russian front and the German front. The Russians would shoot their artillery across our heads, and the Germans would shoot their artillery across our heads.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, you did get to Stutthof.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, the second time. Now, Stutthof the first time was paradise in comparison to Stutthof the second time. Rampant typhoid, hardly any food, Russian plans attacking us, didn't know that it was probably a camp or so. The ovens burning all the time, hardly anything to eat, people dying left and right, being shot left and right, Germans unleashing their dogs, police dogs. And, the police dogs biting people including Julius Goldberg was bitten like mad. His feet swelled up, and we were there for about two weeks, maybe a little longer give or take a week or so when suddenly the order came, "Evacuation." We're going to be evacuated by boat. And, again, we were hauled off in these mini-train, these mini-railroad tracks, not the regular ones to barges in Danzig, or near Danzig, barges. And, then we were taken on these barges on the high seas -- the Baltic, the North Sea. For the trip, we received a loaf of bread and some water. That was it because we subsisted on sea water during the trip, salt water.</p><p>SS Guards were guarding us, and if you had to step out, you had to do it over the railing and into the water on these barges, and you could see the SS Guards pushing people with their shoes into the Baltic or into the North Sea. I remember very distinctly I suddenly saw a German coming, passing me. | thought, well, this was my end, but it passed me and didn't do anything. And, we were down, et cetera. To climb up we had no strength left or anything of the sort, but Julius despite his illness, I mean he was as strong as a bull. I've never seen anything like it in my life. And, suddenly we were told that we had arrived in Hamburg, but I don't think it was Hamburg, but this is what I remember, and that we had to get out very quickly for Hamburg because the Americans were in Hamburg. It was actually the Brits, not the Americans, and then, we were taken back to the high seas, and at night the German guards abandoned us, and we were told that we were in minefields.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: On the high seas, minefields, abandoned and we didn't know what to do. On our barges, were Norwegian POWs, and they collected the blankets we had still from the camp, and made sails out of them. And, came close to, very close to the shore that we later learned was Neustadt in Holstein, about 25 miles or kilometers from Lubek, and the decision was made -- this was about four o'clock in the morning, five o'clock in the morning, May the third -- that we would wade to shore and walk in the direction of Hamburg where the Americans are, and we'lI be liberated. Julius was immediately for wading and was taking me along. I said, "Julius please, please let me die. I have no strength. Please leave me alone!" I remember Julius was stone. He said, "Nope, you're coming with me", and took me by the collar and dragged me. We had to go down, and actually in this very cold May in the North Sea, early morning, and I knew a little bit how to swim from the Baltic. I grew up on the shores of the Baltic.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: By now, I really felt totally, completely, totally exhausted -- completely and totally starved because we were subsisting on sea water.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, I had a feeling that she's alive, but where, what, when, et cetera, no. Before I go to the Warburg Estate, a group of Russian officers arrived with British officers trying to convince me to go back to Latvia, go back to Latvia, go back to the Soviet Union, et cetera. The answer -- my answer was a categorical no because we made a pact, a family, never go east, go back. You go. We have relatives in England, the United States, and we're given a name so on and so forth to remember, but never go back, and I said, "Categorically, I'm not going back." The British officers still tried to convince me to go back, and a good number did go back. Some of them are now in Israel. After horror -- after spending horrible times in the Soviet Union in Latvia until the "70s, and I refused to go back. Then, the Brits became suspicious of me that I wasn't Jewish, despite the fact that I'm circumcised, and put me, brought me, took me to a Latvian children's home where only Latvian was spoken, where some of the leaders were former patients of my father, where they talked about Tievzeme in Latvian, the Fatherland, how eventually we'll all go back to the Fatherland, et cetera, but this was a little bit strange to me because we had Latvian guards. Some of the Latvians were innocuous. Others were horrible. I believe this guy Cukurs, especially Cukurs. I didn't feel comfortable there. They also wanted to introduce me -- they had with a woman.

And, I just had to write "Eighteen" and it would arrive by tube, and then we would meet or something or other. I knew about as much about dancing as I know about the ballet dancing (laughs), but I learned, et cetera, and because one of the things that I remembered very well became the rage in Latvia before the war in the late "30s was the Tango, and a particular type of Tango Naturno. It was one dance, and the Lambeth walk. People went crazy tangoing and Lambeth walking. So, I was sort of going to live their lives.</p></p></dialogue>

As long as we were there in the morning for hitamulut is what they called it in Hebrew, the exercises, callisthenic exercises, appearing in class, doing some homework.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: At any time because in every single envelope there's five dollars, ten dollars, sometimes twenty dollars coming from especially from my cousins in West Hartford and Salt Lake City, and sometimes I would get two or three letters a day -- a week from each of them.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, it's just that it's a kind of self-confidence. It's not clear to me exactly where it comes from, but you obviously have a fantasy of what life ought to be.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Just fantasy as it was.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And, you wanted to live it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was living a fantasy, but I fanaticized before the war because I found it very, very exciting when they talked about when my mother and father were for the first time in Paris in 1928 at Maxime's when the dinners my parents attended in the private home, the private residence of my aunt in Berlin, for the diplomatic core, where Hindenburg would say to my aunt, "You are my Garbo. You have to sit next to me." et cetera. She was very strikingly beautiful woman. She basically looked like Garbo, and the whole lifestyle that we lived was a kind of a fairy tale which I never lived again because I didn't have any means. But, as a child I at least fanaticized right after the war and whatever I could, I did. Then, came the day when I was brought to Berlin to meet my mother.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Wait a second, on the telephone didn't you ask her about nightclubs in Berlin?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, it was -- that is coming. I'm coming to this one. In the car, I was taking by the Joint finally in May 1946 to Berlin. I was thinking, "Do I really want to go and meet my mother?"</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Interesting.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Am I going to live the old lifestyle again with governesses who are rigid -- a certain rigid approach? Because now I'm a man of the world. I had my own car. I had</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

I was able to do as I pleased. I'm not so sure that I want to see my mother again especially if she would insist on the same type of rigidity, not the walls, but rigidity to which I was accustomed to. So, when we arrived finally late in the evening, my mother lived privately, not in a DP camp, we lived privately in Berlin, I was brought up and the person -- her name was Selma from the Joint Distribution Committee from the Bronx, lovely, lovely woman -- and I saw my mother, and I gave her pro forma, a kiss, and she gave me pro forma, a kiss, and the first thing I asked her was, "Tell me, mother, what is the nightclub situation like in Berlin?" I wanted to show her who am I. She looked at me and said, "That's a very interesting question that you're posing. Did you know that until now, I was here all alone in Berlin, but now that you are, we'll be able to explore it together." She disarmed me on the spot, and I was satisfied with the answer and was looking forward to a life in Berlin.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, did it turn out to meet the fantasy?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It turned out, yes, but rather than going to nightclubs, we went to some very interesting cafes. We didn't go to a cabaret. I don't remember, no, because I don't think I could get in in those days, but I dragged my mother literally to two to three movies a day, two to three movies.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: A day?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: A day, sometimes from on movie out into the second. Later on in New York, my mother said, "Well, when you came and you had a problem." But, she was really wonderful. For example, she decided to sleep with me in the same room. I had nightmares, and she would jump up and calm me down from the nightmares, "Everything is fine, George, we're together." And, I went back to sleep, but lasted for months and months and months. And, then she said, "George, I'1l do everything possible in my life to make life as wonderful for you as possible for you to forget these horrible years." And, she did it. But, then when she saw that she had a problem, she said, "George, let's go, there's a DP camp. There's some sort of a school, and you may meet interesting people there." And, I was always interested in meeting interesting people. I didn't cherish the idea of a school, but let's go and look at this.</p><p>And, lo and behold, I went to this school where Renia was my classmate. I was the youngest in my class.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Schlachtensee, exactly, I traveled everyday by elevated from where we lived privately in Berlin to Schlachtensee camp and then I went back because in Hamburg, we were all juvenile delinquents, and we didn't take classes all that seriously -- spitballs. We used to shoot spitballs at the teachers. So, I thought we'd do the same in Berlin which to an extent we did.

And, the other young ladies, attractive young women laughed at me, and I felt very insulted, and I say to Renia even now, "I still haven't forgiven you."

So, but, these were also formative years. These were also the years, where I became very much involved in betar. I don't know if you know anything about betar, the revisionist outfit. I went in eventually to the Stern gang. I was really radicalized, but this is a chapter in itself post World War II.</p></p></dialogue>

In the meantime, she would have me, obviously, for six, seven years, I guess to brainwash me. So, we decided that we would go to America, and my cousins provided the visas, and actually they paid for us to go second class, business class on either the Queen Mary or the Queen Elizabeth, and the Joint promised that tickets would be issued for us for to go on the Queen Mary or Queen Elizabeth. We would go by way of Paris to Marseilles -- yeah, Marseilles I think it was -- embarkation and -- no, not Mar -- I don't remember the port, and the Joint "pocketed" the money.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, but my cousin said later on, "Let's forget. They used it for others." And, we went on the SS Marine Perch which was a troop carrier. That was in March 1947. We left Berlin together with the Lermans.</p></p></dialogue>

Aboard ship, Miles and I, we were bunking together, and my mother was bunking with Renia and Chris. So, the twelve days, we were also together aboard ship, and then we landed in New York. And, I was very disappointed because I was told in Berlin, the night before, you can already see the lights of New York. So, the night before, I stood on the deck looking for the lights of New York, and I didn't see any. It was a clear night, and I believed it, and then we docked on 42(tm) or was it 44" Street and Twelfth Avenue, and these were shacks. I was so disappointed, and it was a misty morning. I didn't see any skyscrapers. I just saw the West Side Highway. This was my first shock of the new world.</p></p></dialogue>

So, we moved to Manhattan. But, I loved it in Brooklyn in the meantime. I was registered there in the New Utrecht High School in Bensonhurst, and there I fell into an interesting group of Jewish activists, so on and so forth, and one thing led to the other, but this is now coming to the United States, already in the United States.</p></p></dialogue>

Brooklyn didn't have any. There was a Hotel St George, I think that was about twelve or fifteen stories, but nothing like the Empire State Building.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How was your English then? Was that okay?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Pretty good. It wasn't good, but I would say it was pretty good. I understood, sometimes. That's an interesting story about going to school. It was obligatory of us to get a high school degree, and I lived in the district in New Utrecht, and it was an uncle by marriage that took me to New Utrecht, to Brooklyn, and in Bensonhurst, and I was overwhelmed by the most gorgeous teachers in the world who looked to me like seventeen, eighteen, but where actually -- they were actually seventeen, eighteen, but I figured they must be in their late 20s or 30s because they had manicured nails. In Europe, this was forbidden for students. No lipstick permitted, no powder, no mascara, or anything. So, I thought that they were all teachers. I said, "My god, this is going to be interesting."</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And I registered. I was registered and I started only to find out that they were all students, wonderful, one more gorgeous than the other, especially the Italian girls.</p><p>They were young, they're absolutely gorgeous, and I skipped a lot of grades. Hebrew from - they tested me and put me immediately into Hebrew six, the last semester. So, I got credits as a foreign language. English, I started with English one. They put me in the most fundamental course, but was transferred shortly thereafter to English three.</p><p>So, I managed to skip a number of grades. History -- World War II history, I didn't read about it, but I knew more than the kids in class. In short, I graduated high school, which I would have never been able to do in the gymnasium in less than two years, New Utrecht High School. To my mother, this was heaven. At least, I have a degree now. Now, let's see where we go from here.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay, just a couple of things about what people's impressions of Europeans were like when you came. So, the people thought that you lived a very primitive life, I gather.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. First of all, I heard the first time the term "coot"</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: "Coot"</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: "Coot" and I came home to my uncle and aunt, and I said, "The girls say that I'm a coot. What does it mean?" Cute, but as I understand it, and never knew the word cute, that I was cute. They thought I was cute, et cetera.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, that's nice. That must have made you feel very good.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, I was delighted, and I sort of reciprocated. I don't know what term I used, but then it was very interesting. I had a science teacher who in one day said, "Look how advanced we are and how backward Europe is. In Europe, the people don't even have eyeglasses." I raised my hand and said, "Not so, my brother wore eyeglasses. There were eyeglasses. I saw many people with eyeglasses." "Oh, you're dreaming.</p><p>Certainly not in those days before the war, maybe now here and there, but there were no such things as eyeglasses." And, he had eyeglasses and some of the students had eyeglasses. We have eyeglasses. Then I remember some of the friends that I made over there, I visited their homes in Bensonhurst and in Borough Park, and they said to me, "Look electricity." I said, "Yes." And, they were surprised that I was nonplussed by it because they said, "In Europe, you don't have this." I said, "We had electricity." So, they were thinking that I was spinning, or running water or things like these, and when they asked me how I lived, and originally when I explained, they thought that I was fibbing. So, I decided to shut up, and just listen and not say anything because what I encountered here were I guess middle class people who had no inkling what another type of lifestyle may be, and my mother did the same. Only among her friends, she had plenty of friends here from pre-war Europe, we knew at our homes, the homes of my relatives, et cetera where the surroundings were sumptuous. So, in this milieu, I kept my mouth shut because they just didn't believe me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did your mother speak English when she came here?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Her English was not as good as mine because she grew up with French, and English, she did not participate directly in the tutorials that my brother and I had in Libau, but she was a voracious reader, started immediately to read the newspapers, started immediately to read some of the easy novels, English novels, and picked it up, picked it up.</p></p></dialogue>

He was a friend of the family way back in Latvia. What was his name, and he was the head of the music of the orchestra in Radio City Music Hall. He converted __ and my aunt, I remember, telling the story before the war, and I saw Pipke in a train going from Berlin to wherever she was going, and suddenly Pipke is there with a big cross, and I said, "Pipke, what are you doing with this cross?" And, he said, "Well, this and that. So on and so forth, et cetera, et cetera." But, my mother went to see him, and he knew that my mother played, but she said, "Look, I didn't play for years. It could take me" et cetera, and then he said, "I can offer you something for maybe thirty dollars a month in those days or so. She figured because we were living on an allowance from the Joint at that time, and my mother didn't want to keep on getting money from my relatives. She wanted to be independent and we did not -- later on we found some moneys back that we had in Europe, but it was a few years later. So, it was tough, but she said for thirty dollars, I can't make ends meet, et cetera. So, she declined, and I guess he was just as happy that she declined. I assume, but he was prepared to give here -- but, she had a very rare cello, my mother, by name -- by a man named Schweitzer who did many, many cellos, but only two cellos for women, and my mother had one cello of the two which were taken by the Germans, and she got it from my grandparents when she began the music conservatory, this cello. I often claimed, and I don't know if I'll ever see anything by it, but the Germans confiscated this as well, this cello.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, did she end up working?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, she actually for a while, she always loved to stitch maybe a pillow or something, and she was offered something if she wanted to do even at home, if she wants to do some stitching on men's jackets, working piece work. So, she took this and made sometimes a hundred dollars a week, which was a lot of money in those days in the late "40s, but once we started finding some of our funds back, not the major ones, et cetera. So, things began to be easier. The first couple of years were difficult years, yes.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Through the friends that I made in, at Utrecht, New Utrecht. It was a very heavily Jewish group over there, quite radical, that accorded with my tastes, and I became very active in betar in the Borough Park Chapter, and then the issue became whether tojoin___ or the Stern, and there was a tremendous discord over one issue -- the bombing of the King David Hotel. The issue was to forewarn the British or not forewarn the British. insisted that it was right to forewarn the British even if <span class="page-break" number="83"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 1 Brits are our enemies, look what they're doing to us, hardly permitting any Jews to migrate to Palestine, and we are not going to forewarn the Brits. And, I was so radicalized over the issue of Jewishness, even though I knew relatively little what it meant, that I joined Stern, and there we seriously trained for all sorts of things including assassination. Interesting, before I quit Stern, that was a chapter in itself because I was nearly shot for it -- before I quit Stern, we were going to assassinate Sir Gladywn Jebb. Sir Gladywn Jebb at that time with a British rep at Lake Success at ____. Why were we going to assassinate him, like we assassinated Lloyd Moyne in Egypt in 1944? Assassinated Bernadotte? Because, not because he was not a nice person. He was actually a very nice person, but he represented Britain, Britain's policies toward the Jews in Palestine. So, he was a target, but for various reasons, I quit the Stern group. There was a court proceeding.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You were court marshaled?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Ina sense, yes, court marshaled for quitting, so on and so forth. But -- and we were trained here on a farm in Jersey. Does the name Josephson mean anything to you?</p><p>Josephson wrote the book, "The Robber Baron's", his brother, I think it was Murray, brother's name, prominent Wall Street lawyer, and his wife. They let us -- their estate gave us for basic training. We were trained by Sternists hiding here in the United States. The Brits put the price 5,000 pounds in those days, for their heads, and we were trained. We smuggled arms, ammunitions. We learned assassination tactics. We learned all sorts of things on the estate. The FBI and together with Scotland Yard began to discover what we were doing. So, we had to empty out or___-- what we called storage place of guns, ammunitions, in the Lower Eastside. We dumped it all in the East River. Some of my colleagues were caught. I was not caught dumping some of the stuff in East River. But, an interesting incident happened that affected me very greatly. Our headquarters was on Second Avenue, around Eleventh Street, 149 Second Avenue, and there was a right nearby, a little sort of a synagogue which <span class="page-break" number="84"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 2 especially the leaders, if they did not agree to the idea of the Shtei gadot I'jardein meaning two sides of the Jordan, but it's the old tradition of Palestine.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><p> A Greater Palestine, and that was can assassinate those Jews, and after having suffered what I have suffered, et cetera, kill a fellow Jew? As young as I was, I had enough brain, and as uneducated as I still was, I had enough brain to say, "That doesn't sit right." -- was reason number one.

So, I took the exam and I managed to get in. It was an eight hour entrance exam in those days, very tough, but I managed to get in, and I worked at the same time to help out. I didn't want -- I knew that my mother was struggling even though she never said a word, et cetera. So, I wanted to make some money on the side. So, I worked in the library. I worked as a runner for a friend of mine, here in the jewelry district who opened a business. So, I managed some way or other always to earn between ten and twenty dollars a week on top of studying et cetera. So, but I did not have to depend on my mother's meager income. Then, I -- at the beginning, it didn't interest me very much, the studies, but suddenly, something clicked and I began to read voraciously because my mother kept on saying always, "You know, a man for me, is not a man without an education." And would say to me, "How can one really live a life without reading a good book." The literature Pushkin, Lermantov, Thomas Mann et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. This is part of life." Because they used to discuss it at dinner tables as a child. It didn't interest me. Characters, who cared? The character's in a book. Ideas were ridiculous. But, suddenly, something snapped, and I couldn't stop reading, and I began to read a lot, day and night, and what interested me particularly was a history of World War II, and one thing led to the other, led also to literature, led to philosophy, led to even an interest in the sciences. For a while, I thought of studying medicine. I met a young woman who was going to study medicine. Her father was a doctor. She was interested in medicine. So, I figured I would also take some courses, and I took courses along those lines, but I reacted very poorly to formaldehyde. Pus developed under my eyes and we had to dissect pigs and rats, and from all the formaldehyde, I began to get rashes here on the side. So, I really had trouble, not that medicine interested me, but I decided to have something in common with the woman that I thought I fancied. But, so much the better that I didn't.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, first, yes, Political Theory because I majored originally in history, then Political Science, and then PhD, actually PhD in Political Science because I had majored in History and I always felt when I became already sort of semi-educated that you can't be a good Political Scientist without a thorough knowledge of History especially the Western Tradition from Antiquity to the Present, and you could not be a good historian, without an understanding of political relations between and among states, and international relations, so on and so forth.</p></p></dialogue>
