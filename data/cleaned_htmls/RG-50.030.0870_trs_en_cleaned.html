When they had the rations they came and they went into every house to seize the people.</p><p>And they took out whoever they wanted. Old people, young people. So my father we had the, it was a small house and under the steps was a place where you could go in so my father opened the floor. He cut the floor open and he made a hiding place. They shouldn't come there because they took children and everybody to take for killing. So when they were the rations we lived on, it was like you see here, (gesturing with hands in circular motion) the streets went like this so like you lived on this side of the street, on the other side. There was a small place that you could <span class="page-break" number="40"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Marcia Loewi 42 go through to the other street without going around.

My father she could, they also were afraid they'd take the old people for killing too.</p><p>So we he dug it, a hole and from the center he made two like benches to sit. He put a piece of board so that people could hide there. and we knew that if we heard the steps so we locked the children's mouth. He shouldn't hear noises. And when they went away someone brought the key and that we could go out so that we could go into the houses.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Isee. So that's at the end of the time. But throughout the ghetto time, you had so many small children in your family. It was a risk.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah who had to hide. It was a risk because they took away, they had no use for small children, so they killed them. They killed them. We don't know where they took them. My aunt we heard, she had two boys. Her husband ran to Russia and she was stayed with two boys so she lived not far from us and we took her in whenever she was all alone. So she's also residing there.

They were hungry so they got the food to they could live. Yes, they were starving. Was very bad. We were hungry in the ghetto. There was a joke that was a song in and I have for you a good thing.

<dialogue class=""><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Marcia Loewi 71</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Through friends.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did he get there? How did he leave the Soviet Union?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, he was, Soviet Union. He came, they came home to Poland with his mother and the brother was sick.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did he? He got better?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes and my husband had already a heart condition. I didn't know but somehow he lived but gave us four children and he took care of us. That's why I believe in God because we see it that we were very helpless and who helped us.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Is there something else you would like to add to your story for today. You've talked about an awful lot and it's only, in a few hours you can never get the full story of a person. But here we're close to the end and I wanted to ask, is there something else you would want people to know what you've gone through, what you experienced and how you came out of it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The only way I could explain that God took care of us because we by ourselves we had no way to go to Israel because the children transports weren't allowed to go in the time when we, we didn't' have where to go and we didn't know what to do. And somehow God showed us a way. We didn't do it by our self. So I, whatever happens to us it's not that we're so smart, that <span class="page-break" number="70"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Marcia Loewi 72 one is smarter than the next one, some people are smart. And it's not meant for them to have anything. And they struggle. Some people get very rich and some people are not so rich and they have to make the best with what they have. But the main thing in my life is whether I did anything good that I helped somebody when he needed me. And whenever I could, I was able to. ""m not sorry. I'm only sorry that I maybe didn't do enough. What we tried to do and we could.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did you tell your children about your experiences during the war. Did you share --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, not when they were young. Now I did. Now when they were, when they understood already, I did. My husband spoke more about it, what he went through. And he was but he injected the belief and he showed me many times in life I thought it's not going to work. It's not going to be good. My husband was sick and I was pregnant with my third child. I didn't know that from the beginning he struggled plenty too. But everybody does. So he told me and he said but you said he had a small heart attack. He was in besert so he said to me don't be scared. You see God takes care of us. And if God will want me to live, I will live and don't worry. God provides for everything. And he injected into the children the belief and trust in God. And we, the truth and it's a true thing that he could only trust in God because he takes care of us. Because ourselves, we think we're smart. We can do. It's not what happened that night a friend of his went to a wedding and he passed across the street to the subway to get the subway from East Broadway and a motorcycle came and on the spot he was dead. So he said there is no insurance in life for anything. If you are supposed to live and you have to live, God helps you. But if you are supposed to die in one minute, you are dead. So then I said whatever it was, we managed <span class="page-break" number="71"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p></p></dialogue>

He was also a Holocaust survivor without a hand. And the principal directed him to our house. It was holiday. So he came. He wasn't an easy person with one hand and my younger daughter had to take him across the subway. He was scared but my husband said he is a guest. You have to treat him better than yourself. And if he needs your bed, you give your bed to him. So he injected it into the children too. And thanks to him we have good children.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I think not only thanks to him but probably also thanks to you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah but yes, I did too. And whenever he brought somebody home, I never said, I always took him with a smiling face and made them feel good. I guess I got it a little from home too.</p></p></dialogue>

It was called the Visola street hospital. It's for mental ill and they said what they saw happened. Animals, animals wouldn't act like this. In essential and people that were not capable.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And was it one part of the ghetto connected to another part of the ghetto.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Part of the ghetto yes, but I think this bridge probably was built before the war because it was a big bridge. You went up steps and there was a walk.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was the name of the hospital. Do you remember.</p></p></dialogue>

Sometimes we used to go there in recess time. So we walked and we talked you know but I didn't' have connection with the people. We just heard it and it was a terrifying thing.

There were like two, they had a place for horses for cattle. So they, the people that lived there they had friends of my cousin. He had a store that was selling wheat and food for horses and animals. So he exchanged the houses. So we took the expensive dining room set, we took it to the ghetto. But once somebody was showing, if somebody showed who was rich Jews and who has who might have money, then they came to the house and they looked in the whole house. The children were standing. And my father told us don't look the direction where I have some, the older children.</p><p>The younger didn't know. So we had like medicine cabinet. In that medicine cabinet my father because somebody denunciated that were rich. So he said don't look in the direction where I have something because they look in the places and then they follow where everybody is nervous about so there was in the bathroom was the medication we had some diamonds. Because my father when he gave up the business for the first year they needed a textile factory to make uniforms and they paid for it something. And my father had the raw material. Not finished textile. So they paid something for it and let him stay in the city for a while.</p></p></dialogue>
