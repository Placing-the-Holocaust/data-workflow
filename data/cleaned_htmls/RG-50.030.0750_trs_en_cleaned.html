That the whole world, even United States, they knew what's going on in Europe, they knew what the German do to the -- not only to the Jews, they killed also five million Poles, and plus other nationality. And they knew what's going on. And what they do?

Let us at least do something, not to go like sheeps to -- to the killing area. I don't know, maybe this was the -- the -- for years the Jews were depressed.
