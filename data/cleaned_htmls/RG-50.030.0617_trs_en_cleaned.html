<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, my father came. I said good bye to my mother, and that was something. And we got -- we stayed there about two days before they assigned us, to put us on the trains.</p><p>Quite an experience for a young person, you know, leaving like that, but at that age I don't think that we gave it as much thought as we should have, you know, but...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember any of your thoughts going through your mind at that time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Nota whole lot, but when we left, it sort of had gotten away from me, but I know the test was early in the morning and we were tired, but I must have scored quite well because they picked me for the Air Force, and I figured --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: That's a pretty good place.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- that's a little boost, right. I guess I had enough left. And I did graduate. I won the allegiant award for the person who was supposed to be successful in the class.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So tell us a little bit about that? So you took the test in Des Moines, and then what happened after that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Iwent to Kearns, Utah, and stopped there. We stopped along as we dropped them off all alongthe way, but I was the first one dropped off, I guess, at Kearns.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: By train?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right. That was a train -- it was an old base that they changed into a training base for the Air Corps. And then they sent me to school in Colorado, Fort Collins. I went to a six-week school there and I worked for -- I mean, the airplane supply when I went to Fort Dix, New Jersey, and that's where I was stationed for two years.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So let me retrace these steps. Do you remember the day you were -- not drafted but the day you left home to start your Army service? What month was that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: April.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How large was Kearns, Utah? How large was the base?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, it was a big base. I would imagine there was over 20,000 there probably. It was quite large. And each of us was assigned a drill master, you know, for a group in our barracks.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did people already assume that the U.S. is going to go to war with Germany in Europe, or were you thinking more or less you would be shipped out somewhere in the Pacific?</p></p></dialogue>

I think the Pacific was more in the minds of people. I think it was Being (?marry?) and all in that part, but then sometimes they would ship you from California to go the other way, from the other direction to go that way, that was hard to figure out sometimes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You're in the Army now?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right. And then when the bombs came -- I don't know if you want me to tell you about it now.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, I do, but I'm going to get there.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I'm going to get there. I want to get a sense of -- I want to get a sense of what various stops you were on in your Army service, on your military service. So we're starting with the Air Force and you went from Kearns, Utah --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: To Fort Collins, Colorado, by train again, and had about a two-month course there.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: On what?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: An Army course for the Air Corps.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: For the Air Corps?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: For working in a maintenance area where you supplied the supplies for B-17s. Yes, it was a B-17 base, and then I worked there two years. I got my promotions in one month, three months in row.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. Fort Collins -- yes, yes, that's right. First I went to Mitchel Field up in Long Island.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What's that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was an air base there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But then I was only there a few days. They needed someone in Fort Dix, New Jersey, so they shipped me back down there, but I did get to go up there and see -- long train ride up to Long Island.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And at Fort Dix, that was still Air Force?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So if you were there for two years, how did you spend your time? What was a typical day like?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, it was a lot of drilling we did at times. We had to keep our physical -- keep in shape. And then I worked in the supply center it was. We had to organize all of the equipment, and when a plane came in and needed a part, we had to get it and deliver it to them. So that was mainly what I was doing, the technical supplies.</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So it was from April of "43, April "44, and then was it from Fort Dix that you left for Germany, that you left for Europe?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. Then I went to Texas. They gave me another six-week refresher on more like infantry training, you know, in case we would have to join the infantry.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But you were still Air Force at that point?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right. More or less, right. Uh-hum. Right. And then they assigned me -- well, when the (?bomb?) came, then they assigned me to the engineer battalion, 15th Engineer Battalion, right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So that's where the switch came from Air Force to Army?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You see then -- well, then I get the order, I guess, I get to go home on a little vacation, or furlough they call it, and then it's over to Boston, I guess, and we shipped out on Liberty Ship.</p></p></dialogue>

First Wasserburg was another one, Furstenfeldbruck, and then we were in a wooded area somewhere, I don't know where that -- that was in Bavaria somewhere. And then one of the singers from America came over to entertain, one of the famous singers from the band, when they had the bands, and I remember that. But then there was this little town. I was -- at night I had to go to this little office and make the roll call for the morning and things.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: That was going to be my next question. What was your job when you --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: That's what I did. I was the morning clerk, more or less, because there was no engineering work to do yet, so they kept me over there. And one night I was going there walking on the sidewalk and a big flowerpot fell about that far ahead of me, and I don't know if it was an accident, but they did check it out the next day and they never found out anything about it. But otherwise I noticed this one young girl that lived across the street from where we were staying and she'd always look out the window at us, you know, and she was kind of -- one day I saw her walking on the street, and I just said, "Hello Fraulein." We weren't associated with them, but she was so scared. She just walked by real fast. And they were afraid to come out in a way in the daytime even though we wouldn't have done anything.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you felt a certain kind of distrust, a fear of you?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was probably after Wasserburg and we loaded up, and 20 of us, I think, were on this truck. Or two trucks. I think there were five in each side.</p></p></dialogue>

Tell us what you saw when you went there. You're in these two trucks, about 20 guys.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. Okay, we pull in there, at first I don't see -- it looks like a peaceful city, you know. Here we are on the ground area and I get out -- we get out to stretch our legs, but the minute I turn, I'm facing that way and I see this boy, eight to ten years old, and he's talking to a soldier, and he has something in his hand, and I go -- naturally I wanted to see what's going on there, and so I go over there and I see the furnace immediately with the door open.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Do you remember what he looked like, how he was dressed? What --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: He just had on regular pants and a shirt and he was about -- and that soldier bought these from him, the pictures. I wonder where he got them. I think about it so many times, where did he get those pictures, but they were --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did he look like he was a local boy from the town who had come there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's what I'm -- I'm thinking he was either from Dachau or he was from that thing that I called the hospital. Now, I'm not sure if that was the hospital back there, because on the map that I was sent, it showed the hospital in a more area where there were all buildings around it, but that wasn't the case where I landed there.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Gray. Lots of gray hair. And some were kind of black, you know, but they were big, and the door was open. And then I turned around the other way and there was the water tower, and it wasn't a typical water tower where you would get drinking water from. I'm sure it wasn't. I'm sure it was a collecting tower for water where they could perform those experiments that I read about, you know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, tell me what you had read, because I was trying to get a sense of how much you knew what you were going to see, and it seems that you didn't know that there were some things that were going on.</p></p></dialogue>

There was a big opening door and you go in there and that's where the tables were with all of these instruments that were manufactured, and I believe --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: What kind of -- I'm sorry, did I interrupt you?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think the Holocaust victims might have made those. But I saw no machinery in there at the time because we didn't get to stay there long enough. We only saw the first table, but I'll bet there were a hundred tables in there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But tell me what kind of instruments are you talking about?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, there was compasses, pliers. Excuse me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Pliers, compasses, wrenches, all kinds of drafting material. Beautiful, beautiful things they were. And I wish I could have gone in -- and you know what happened the next day? We never went in there again, so I think the thing was locked up.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were there walls?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, there, okay. We were fenced in. We got the building there and then there are trees. All around us there's trees, so you don't see much other than the building that I mentioned and the water tower. We're hemmed in. And the Danube was right behind our building.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, in other words, you've driven into an enclosure? The trucks have gone into an enclosed area?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: More or less with the trees, if you count the trees. There was no fences.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: By that point does somebody come to you and say why you're there? Do you figure out why you're supposed to be there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not even yet, no. It took a few days and then finally one morning the lieutenant said we're going to dig out here. He put me in charge and we started digging some holes for the posts.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: For posts?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Posts for a little stockade, I guess, we were going to build. For whom I don't know.</p><p>They didn't tell us that, either.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you're digging and there are 20 of you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right, about 20.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you're the one who is responsible for them to make sure that they dig properly?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right, I was supposed to make sure that they did the digging. I did some of the digging and the lieutenant said, "You don't have to do that, you're in charge of this," but I kept digging anyway. I like to work. But then about two or three days later is when I saw that stockade in the other direction, and then all of a sudden all of these women appear looking through the fence, but you can't see many buildings because of the trees again. But then on this side you could see a little part of a building there, so maybe they were in that building the day before.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you know who they were?</p></p></dialogue>

They were all dressed in these brown skirts and brown blouses.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did they look well fed?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not real well, no. They looked a little haggard, but they had been fed, I'm sure, yes.</p><p>They weren't -- nothing like the Holocaust victims, I'm sure. I bet they were political prisoners or something.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So they still had been prisoners of the Germans?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It wasn't Germans who became prisoners?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. Evidently they were from different countries because they looked a little different, not all alike.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Isee.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Iwish I knew who they were, but then we lost track of them. They were gone again after a while. Maybe they left at night or something. That camp was weird in a way that there were ghosts there. There was no traffic in or out after we came. I can't remember a single truck or anything coming in. And the people at that hospital, that I call a hospital, about a hundred yards down the line from our building, all I saw there -- we weren't supposed to go there either -- were nurses evidently because they had the white uniforms on, and I felt, well, maybe they're nursing some of these Holocaust victims who couldn't move or be transferred.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Where did you see those, those people?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. They were down there. Sometimes you would see one come out, I think. I'm sure they were because we couldn't tell from a distance, but I assumed they were.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I guess part of me is a little confused because I always pictured that Dachau as a concentration camp had to be enclosed because otherwise people would escape.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh. Hum.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But that's not what you saw?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not our area, no.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Unless the Army removed it, you know, but I doubt that. But they had removed all of the bed and things, I'm sure, from all the trains and everything. We didn't see any of that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What date was it that you entered?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: This was a little later. I think we came there in June and then we stayed into July.</p><p>So it was over a month after they had been cleared. But that's what I figured was going on down there at that hospital, that they were treating survivors.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: They were treating survivors?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, and that would fit in perfectly there.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, they wanted us to get organized in our place where we were going to stay, so</p><p> they took us away.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They came from Dachau, I think, and at the time I guess they were 17, 18 years old, so I -- they would put on their bathing suits and stand there and kind of wave at us, but all of a sudden we would wave or something and then they would go back and have their coats on quick. They did that two or three times. They would switch back and forth and then they were gone, and we just wadded in the water there. It was kind of -- cool off in July.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It was hot.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. That seemed to be quite gone, but I'm just sure -- I read about that also, how the smoke was drifting terrible. I'm sure it's in all those places. But I can say that there was no fence around us but these trees hemmed us in. We were hemmed in and we just never -- and why we were given a pass to get out of there, I don't think that anybody ever left the camp other than the Danube River there a little bit.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We just had some posts in there. And the holes took a long time to dig, you know, because it was all by hand and shovel. We didn't have the equipment, you know. That's all we did. I think we had about three or four of those holes dug, and, oh, we're going.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Let's see. I think in that one town, maybe, one little town where we were up ina room and there is a boy -- a couple of boys that always came down, I think they were Jewish. They always came down.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, gosh, I don't know. Furstenfeldbruck maybe or one of those. He'd come up to -- this one man had met them before we got there, and the boys would come up there and I would ask them about school and things, and he spoke a little English, too. They talked in English, I guess, a lot of them. That's the only time, though, that I think that I really came in contact.</p></p></dialogue>

I'm sure we did, yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Where did you go from there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Then I ended up in another wooded area, I think it was, where we had just barracks.</p><p>There was no real headquarters or anything.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can you tell me where -- do you remember the moment you heard that the war had ended?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, let's see. Oh, yes, yes. Where were we? Oh, boy, that was -- we were counting -- I'll tell you, I can't exactly. It's unbelievable.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But when you landed in France, the war wasn't over yet, was it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. Well, we must have heard. It must have been the real happy moment right then.</p><p>It had to be, but I don't know. I just can't put my finger right on it exactly.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you ever -- from the time you landed in Europe, the bells that you heard in the water and then in Le Havre where you landed, did you ever feel like you were in danger?</p></p></dialogue>

And I often think with Dachau, I wonder if I'm standing on ground where people spent the last moment of their lives.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Very possibly.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's what I was -- that bothers me a lot. I'm thinking my feet stood right there where someone maybe was spending their last five minutes on this earth. And I was even thinking when we were digging there what if they had been buried there, but no sign of anything.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did any of your superior officers engage in conversations or explanations as to what Dachau was? Anybody from U.S. military afterwards or during talk with all of you guys who were there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not really. No, they didn't. They didn't express any -- too much -- a lot of this -- you know, it's gone. I don't want to say that they didn't because that would be very important.</p><p>I'm sure we did.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But it sounds like so much of what was going on and from the memories, it was a vacuum of information.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: It was. Well, they don't tell you a whole lot, that's true. We did not know what we were going to do there for a while, no.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I'm sure. But we just never got the opportunity to do that. And going in the big warehouse again, I would have loved to have gone in there and see if there were any machines in there, the back part of it, where they could have been working, you know, to produce those, because I'm sure they did use a lot of the Holocaust people to -- you know, they did work, made them work.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you -- afterwards, in kind of retrospect, were you surprised that you were sent to Dachau?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: But look what we saw. Enough to make you get the full impact. I almost got the full impact of what happened.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, the brick building that you were staying in, do you know what that was used for before during the time there was a concentration camp?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Iassumed it might have been used even by the SS or the doctors. It was a perfect setup for that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: For medical experiments?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Right, I would say so. There were separate rooms, you know, where they had -- where they put them.

Now I'm telling more, and now they're all asking me when they found out, you know, that I went on that Honor Flight, now they're saying, "You mean you were there," but they say most people don't talk -- they didn't talk about their World War II experience.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And they send them where?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My brother said, too, "I didn't know all that," he says, "Why didn't you tell?" But they just say we haven't talked about enough things, even what happened in the war, you know. Right, that's why we're doing these Honor Flights. I mean, you're getting people to open up. And they even asked these questions there when we were in Washington in May. You know, "Where were you, what did you do"? Now they're starting to open up more, and that's what we need, isn't it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Of course.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And that all entered in. When you went in, you had to have three years, I think, so I hit that mark, and then when I went over it, I guess then they put me up -- as we were going -- going home, another one was coming the other way, occupation forces, they passed us. But when we were going to France, too, another one went the other way, they were coming home already. Even though the war wasn't over, they were going back.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It's now a suburb of Munich. Munich has in the decades after the war grew enough that it may not be exactly part of the city, but it's so close to it, considered so close to it.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Discharged home, right. I took the train and they picked me up about 20 miles from home. I could only get within 20 miles because our train didn't run anymore in our little town.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah. They said, "Well, where were you?" you know.

<dialogue class=""><p>Did it shape you in some way?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, in a way I always say to myself it was a great experience for me, in a way it was, to grow up, you know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You felt like you grew up in the Army?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: More about the world, right, what people are like. Read, write. I often say, well, it was kind of tough at times, but I wouldn't want to give it up. It was a valuable thing. It really was. Learning to live under certain conditions and the way you had to eat sometimes and training was even dangerous at night.

We got soaked, you know. Wake up in the morning and they served you some oatmeal and it's raining and, I'll tell you, it was -- and then you had to crawl under the wire fence during the machine gun shooting over you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Is this during training?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, during training. The only mission -- well, they were pretty close. They tried to make it realistic and you had to keep low, keep your head down. Well, I really hope I answered a lot of your things.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I think so. I think so. I appreciate --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: There's a lot of things that I wish I just knew more about, you know, like what happened to that boy --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- where he came from, and those tools, what happened to all that and who made them, and why didn't we finish that what we started.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: A lot of unanswered questions.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right, and what happened to those women over there in that prison, why didn't we see them stockade -- or when did they come, why didn't we know more about that? Huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I think those are terrific questions. I mean, it's sort of like you see something and it stays a mystery until you have an answer for it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And here you were in a place for about six or seven weeks and there was no one who answered all of these mysterious --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right.

It was a perfect setup for that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: For the medical experiments?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right. When I looked at those jars, you don't have parts like that on display if you're just a hospital or something. I wonder why they left them there. I was surprised at that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were there like hundreds of jars?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, there were at least 20 or more, 30. I would say at least three shelves. I can just see them as if I'm looking at them right now. And you wouldn't have that on display unless it was something unusual, like, why did they leave them there? Maybe that's why they locked the building. Maybe somebody came through. I don't know. I wonder if this area where I was if it even is a visitor's place now. I wonder if it is.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Have you ever been back?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You've never been back to Dachau?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. Never went back. That would be sort of interesting, but my age and my health isn't quite up to that anymore. I would start digging if I was there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Maybe you would recognize where you were in relationship to the camp?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right. I think ifthe furnace was still there, I can spot the place, I believe. I know just about where I went from there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It sounds like Dachau was one of those moments that stays in your memory like where you were when Pearl Harbor was attacked?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right. Well, it did, because I told you I don't remember what I ate. I can't picture a single meal.

And then the girls at the river, you know, because the first time I saw any humans other than us. But I think there were only about 20 of us, that was it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Have you kept in touch with any of those others who were with you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. We never got addresses. We should have done that. A lot of groups get together. They do. They're probably all gone now, though. If they were a year older, they might have -- I shouldn't laugh about that -- I didn't laugh, but there aren't many of them around anymore. I don't think so.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, I appreciate that you have shared your thoughts and your memories with us today. Is there anything else that you would like to add?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, I think I've covered it pretty well, I think. I just wish we could have talked with more people though, you know --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Ican imagine.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- the victims. Never got to. Never did. The ones that survived were gone from us.</p><p>They were gone, taken care of evidently.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It sounds like there was -- that there was very little information that you got while you were in Germany.</p></p></dialogue>
