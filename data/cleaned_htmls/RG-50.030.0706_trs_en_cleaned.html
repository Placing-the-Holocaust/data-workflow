You had to walk the four flights, and we were living on the top floor. Why we were living on that top floor? Because when my mother married my father, her mother was living in that apartment, and in those days people were living together, so we were born in that apartment where my, actually grandmother, was already living. <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> Interview with Frank Hyde deg May 4, 2013</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How do you say it in Czech?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- of course in Czech it sounded different than when I say it in English. But the name was still the town, Paris.</p></p></dialogue>

We had a Jewish temple, Jewish synagogue and very small cemetery, because it was in town. So the cemetery was not bigger than this room where we sit.</p><p>But that's where, usually, the Jewish people congregated on holidays. I don't see where it's actually Jewish, or religious, no, but there were holy days where my father, whether he wanted to show his son, or whatever, so we went to the temple, and spent some time in the temple. When I was 13, I was -- I had Bar Mitzvah. But then, because of the circumstances, you know, which unch -- fa -- unfortunately <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> Interview with Frank Hyde " May 4, 2013</p><p> started, you are not so proud to be Jewish. That was -- you know, it was always a handicap, so to speak, in my life.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Even in Czechoslovakia, before Hitler came?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, before Hitler came, everything was normal, nobody cared whether you are Jewish or Catholic or [indecipherable]. The only question -- we used to play soccer, because soccer was the sport in Europe, so the question was only, what position did you play? Nobody ask about religion, or where you came from, or -- was -- was not the subject to talk about. You were Czech, the Czech name, and you were Czech as everybody else, and look, that was not an issue, and -- as much as I remember --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>

Prague, of Czechoslovakia is a reasonably cold setting. If you wanted t-to really get warm, so to speak, you had to -- not fly, there was no planes -- you had to travel down to Etherlis(ph), through Austria, and that's where the warm weather really was -- existed. But coming back to my family, so my father came home, usually in the evening. We had dinner -- I mean, what we had for dinner, he had for dinner, and everything was normal. It was a very normal life. My mother -- now it might sound strange here, because everything is pre-cooked, and pre-packed and stuff like that, but you know, when my -- I remember there was a bed in the kitchen, and I was a very sick child somehow, so I was very much staying in that bed during daytime.

You would have to know more about the history, but Europe was occu -- no, I shouldn't say occupied, say ruled by the Austrian-Hungarian empire.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And that was the House of the Hapsburgs, king of Hapsburgs, or whatever he was, emperor, I don't remember that part. And everything -- the language was much more German, because the Czechs were part of that Austrian empire. But then one of the -- one of the principle politicians over there at the time, Masarek(ph), he petitioned -- came here, and he petitioned Wilson, and I don't know who came after <span class="page-break" number="13"></span> Interview with Frank Hyde " May 4, 2013</p><p> him, or before him, to es -- to give the Czechs the [indecipherable] determination right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So they calfed(ph) out of that Austrian empire afterward, during World War I, Czechoslovakia. There was no Czechoslovakia before. There was -- the state was called Bohemia, Moravia, and Silesia. Those were three states which were, so to speak, the bone of Czechoslovakia. So when, apparently here, or there, when they realize it's too small to be independent, somehow they attached Slovakia to it. And that's why it became Czechoslovakia. The original three states --</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So, the very eastern part of Czechoslovakia was very close to Russia, and that's why it was so, later on, during World War II, Czechoslovakia -- Czechoslovakia was ceded to the Russian sphere of influence.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not at all. The first time I heard Yiddish, you would not believe it, when I was going to Auschwitz. I never heard of Yiddish.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: They were like more Germanic names.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, that was exactly in Prague. So to know somebody by the name of Pekarek and be Jewish, that didn't exist.

But I remember that my teacher, that was the first grade, second grade, you know, I was what, six, seven years old. Somehow she is -- there was some question about religion, and she assign me to the class, or to the time to have religious schooling, to the Catholic class, because of the Czech name. Well, I didn't speak any German, but somehow I objected to it, and I said that I was Jewish. Th -- so she sent me to the Jewish class, <span class="page-break" number="17"></span> Interview with Frank Hyde * May 4, 2013</p><p> or whatever, but I remember the name, that was not a Jewish name at all. Now, this -- we were Jewish. This -- we were born as Jewish people, but then, unfortunately what happened -- I told you I was not a very proud Jew, no, because everything what happened was because of the Jewish faith. And lots of things happened, ma-maybe we come to it.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, we were -- my name was Pekarek.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Pekarek.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I married Georgine, she was Pekarek, of course. And then what happened i -- th- that was 1947 -- 48, the infl -- at that time, the influence of Soviet Russia was tremendous. Why? Because that goes to polit -- politics. The Czechs always felt that the west let them down. Th-The -- the che -- the -- the west means England, not the United States, the United States was out of this world. But England, France, partially Italy, that instead of helping the Czechs, so to speak, maintain their <span class="page-break" number="18"></span> ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion Interview with Frank Hyde " May 4, 2013 identity, freedom, they let them down, and then in turn, Hitler marched in, and the whole situation has changed. So the Russia influence was very strong. We, Georgine and me, we didn't care for it, because we have seen what happened when you don't have freedom. We both survived Auschwitz, we came back in 1945, and were living in Prague as best as we could have done it, until 47 - "48. But when the situation became very, very difficult, we didn't like it. We thought again, we might have to go through the same thing. Maybe not the extremes, but hardly the freedom which we were hoping for. Well, we decided to get out of Czechoslovakia, which was 19 four -- late deg47, early "48. I couldn't get out, because I was, quote, military age. So I thought that if I somehow split with Georgine, that by myself I will be easier to get out than two of us with luggage and all and that stuff. That's how we thought of it. Well, I met somebody by the name of Hyde. His name was Walter E.</p><p>Hyde. Through him, I got a English passport. So Georgine left Prague in February 1948. I couldn't get out that quickly. In the meantime she went from Prague to London, stayed in London for a while. From her mother's side, they were here, surviving the situation in Ecuador. Now, of the f--- all these countries, I'll tell you why Ecuador. That was Georgine's uncle from her mother's side; he was a dentist.</p><p>But he didn't care for dentistry, he was more like a businessman sitting on the board of directors here, sitting on the board of directors there. And somehow he became <span class="page-break" number="19"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Frank Hyde *8 May 4, 2013 consul general of Ecuador. Well, how he got Ecuador, | can't tell you. But that's how it was. So it was -- unfortunately, the situation became worse, before Hitler and all that stuff. He was trying to convince Georgine's mother and father to go to Ecuador because he was able to give them the visa to go to Ecuador. Well, my mother, you know, they were in a different situation. They had a house like a house, and those days there were no mortgages in Prague. So to leave your house, to leave your business, that was unheard of. Why should I go to Ecuador to listen to those idiots down there, or something? This is my home. Well, unfortunately, it didn't work out in the long run, but since they survived in Ecuador, in Quito, they came after the war here, like most of people usually do. So when Georgine was in England, she heard, of course, of her aunt and uncle, that they were here -- they were in Ecuador at that time. But they know they were living in -- in Ecuador.</p><p>They came here and that uncle of hers had some earlier connections to somebody who was a manufacturing person. And because of the Cold War which existed already at that time, somehow the United States government was pumping much more money into Puerto Rico, as a prevention that Puerto Rico wouldn't go too much left, like some of the countries did.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. <span class="page-break" number="20"></span> Interview with Frank Hyde " May 4, 2013</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So he was -- he was offered to build a factory in Puerto Rico. So since that uncle, who was a dentist representative of Ecuador, he told him, well, if you just came from Ecuador, you speak Spanish, you want to manage my factory [indecipherable] from Prague. So they settled to Puerto Rico for some time. So Georgine, not having any other family, from England, went to the United States, went to Puerto Rico.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Rico.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So we stayed, of course, I was in Prague. Not divorced, that was not the question [indecipherable]. But I managed to get out of Prague. By myself it was easier than together with Georgine. So, when I got out of Prague, naturally I had nowhere to go. But the train took me to Paris. Well, I have to say something in favor of the French, irrespective of their view today, of that view. The French, at that time, were extremely helpful. They tried to reunite families who were split, you didn't know where -- last time saw him here, last time you saw him there. So it was very difficult, but the French were helping. And they were helping also, the people like myself, who all of a sudden, from Prague, was in Paris. We were called DPs, displaced people. And I got to Paris couple days before July 14", I'm sure you know what July 14" is. Well at that time, of course, that time was the different. That was 1948, and de Gaulle was still around, and he was running down Champs Elysees, I <span class="page-break" number="21"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Frank Hyde 8 May 4, 2013 remember like today. When I did go to France, to Paris, I was supposed to see somebody who somebody knew somebody in Prague, and I was supposed to see those people. So those people took me to that celebration of July 14". Now, spreading out this story which I'm just telling you, my sister -- or rather, my mother had a sister, who had married a Viennese person, all Jewish, but she didn't like the situation as it was. And, before Hitler came in, she decided, with the husband, to go to, at that time Palestine. There was no Israel. You had to take the boat, which was very difficult, because Prague is right in the middle of Europe, there's no ocean around.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: There's no Czech navy.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: There's no -- no Czech navy, no nothing. But she managed somehow, through someone else, to get the per -- the documents, and she survived the Hitler years in Jerusalem. [indecipherable] | -- I don't know which town she survived, but she was there. So when she came back to Prague looking for her family, but there was no family except us, my sister, me. But she didn't like it because she said exactly what we have found out later on. That it's too autocratic, too left-wingish, and she thought there was no future for Czechoslovakia to survive again. So somehow she has some friends in Australia. So she convinced my sister to go with her. The -- <span class="page-break" number="22"></span> Interview with Frank Hyde *deg May 4, 2013</p><p> incidentally, the husband of my aunt passed away, and he is buried on the mount -- what is the name of the mountain in Israel?

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But she came back by herself, and she convinced my sister to go with her to Australia. Now, my sister, you know, she was very much into languages. So, for her to speak English, French, Italian, although she was born in Prague, she spoke all these languages. So, she was -- for her to go to Australia was no problem, she spoke English. So they went to Australia. Well, the trip to Australia by boat, that's a long distance, this is not around the corner. So when they arrived in Australia, I was in touch with them, or they were in touch with me, they helped me to get to Australia.</p><p>And the French --</p></p></dialogue>

I left July deg48, I got into Australia January "49. So when I go to Australia, of course, Georgine, we were married.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So I didn't like to be someone else, so I dro -- and the name, at that time in Australia, to have a Czech name was -- they couldn't pronounce it, and --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay, so my point -- my question is, is did you get that passport when Walter Hyde provided you with the -- and you chose Hyde as your name, or did you change your name when you were in Australia?</p></p></dialogue>

So, he promised jobs, and he promi -- he didn't say how, but what he did, you have t -- again, I'm talking about history, after World War I, the French and German were not always friends.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay, excuse me, I'm going to interrupt. What I am interested to know is, did Hitler have an influence before he marched in the country, before he marched into Czechoslovakia, and took it over, when you say things changed gradually, was it such that it -- internal life in Czechoslovakia changed for the Jews, even before Hitler came? That's what my question is.</p></p></dialogue>

The border countries of that old Bohemia, which was somehow created by --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- this government here, to give them --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- border. That was occupied by German minorities. But since the constitution was like here, everybody was alike, and there was no ant -- anti-German feeling, or anything like that. But, let's go back to that recession which we had. So, when that was all the world was the depression, and Hitler promised jobs. Now, how did he deliver the job? Because, like I started to say, after World War I, the League of Nation, which was the forerunner of the United Nations, they thought Germany, not Hitler, there was Hindenburg, which was the president.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So he invaded those two places, and nobody stopped him. If they would have stopped him, maybe he wouldn't have been so powerful. But because they didn't stop him, maybe they didn't have the power to stop him.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He has grown. So there was no -- no anti-Semitism in Prague, or anything of that nation. Everybody was Czech, and on the contrary, if you didn't speak well Czech, you were -- somehow you -- you were not liked, if I can say that word. And in that connection, I would also like to tell you, into my house where I was living, somebody moved in from Poland, ab -- what used to call is -- a Polish Jew. His name was Ehrlstein(ph). Well, the name tells you already, German Jew, so -- he became a leader of the Jewish population at that time, because somebody has to represent the Jews --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: --1in connection to the Czech government --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- and what followed, the German government. So he was appointed to be leader of the Jewish community. Since he moved into the house where we were living, <span class="page-break" number="30"></span> Interview with Frank Hyde " May 4, 2013</p><p> spoke poorly Czech -- German was not liked, because we were now, all of a sudden, enemies with the German -- my mother had his wife to go shopping, and all this stuff. Now that [indecipherable] they're all down the road, why we stayed in Prague longer than other people who were already deported, in camp number one.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Let's come to the point where I'll -- I'll speed ahead a little bit. I-- I1- okay, if it is so that life didn't change in the late 1930s for you, in --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not until 1937 - 1938.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: All right, what happened in 1937?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, the Czechs were forced to give up some of these border countries. So there was a resentment against the rest, because officially Russia was -- officially. They were not doing much, but officially they were. So, the negotiations were primarily between Germany, France -- I can even tell you the name of the prime minister of Germany, who was negotiating at that time, wa -- he was a [indecipherable] from like a--</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, he was a aristocrat.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah, aristocrat. His name was Ribbentroph(ph). Well, I -- the -- some other name came back to me, and on the Italian side was Count Charnow(ph). And those <span class="page-break" number="31"></span> Interview with Frank Hyde * May 4, 2013</p><p> people were pushing -- well, at that time they were negotiating with Prime Minister Chamberlain. Now, naturally, in those days, when you gave your word, you were supposed to keep your word. So Hitler, through Chamberlain, through Ribbentroph(ph), and Italian Charnow(ph), Hitler promised the dema -- the demand on the Czechs to give up those border countries, is his last territorial demand. Chamberlain believed it, because in those days, when you signed something, you were believing. So he went back to --- Chamberlain went back to London, where he came from, and showed a piece of paper, and this piece of paper is a guarantee of peace in our lifetime. Well, he didn't realize whom he was deali -- dealing with. But coming back to -- to the Czechs, so there was a certain animosity, of course, because all of a sudden, instead of having the country like this, it was like</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Sliced.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- sliced, and you know, undefensible(ph).</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And in the -- the -- the attitude towards German was all of a sudden they were not our citizens, they were our enemies, because they wanted to join Germany.</p></p></dialogue>

So now all the European continent really turned pro-German. The Austrians, they want to be German. They were German speaking people, but they were so different from actually Germany, that it was not -- you know, th-thinking about, he promised jobs, and he delivered the jobs. Making his armed forces, making all these weapons, which he developed.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But your life, it didn't change?</p></p></dialogue>

We were still playing soccer like everybody else [indecipherable] didn't play any role, no. It really started much later, when he came into Prague, which was in March ninethir -- 1939.

<dialogue class=""><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Frank Hyde " May 4, 2013</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Anti-Semitism to a certain extent, because they were always connected, the Jewish were looked at -- German speaking people, rather than Czech speaking people.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, how did -- my question is much more personal than that. It is, when did your life, your father's life, your mother's life, how did things happen in the family?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>Hitler marches in, and by what point --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, it's changed primarily because young Czech pe -- young Jewish people, th -- we were forced to go on certain labor. We were single men, that's why we married. The single Jewish people, they were -- well, they were taught to meet somewhere, and that's was something what I always call like Madison Square Garden. We don't have Madison Square Garden in Prague --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: What was the square?

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Iwas 18, I was working for a Jewish firm. The Jewish management was thrown out, and a German administrator was sent in. I was still working when he came in, in his black uniform, and a red --</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But they didn't, you know, you didn't do anything, so they didn't bother you, but you s -- you saw the changes which gradually occurred. At home I don't think I have seen so many changes. Maybe I didn't pay attention to it. I was a young man, they still u-- before Hitler came, you know, we still went to dance. And there was a resentment, but there was still freedom enough to go and enjoy -- don't forget, I was what, 18 years. So what did 18 years do here? The same thing they do over there.</p><p>We went to dance. I remember the place where we used to go. It was called coffee shop, but not the type of a coffee shop what we call here a coffee shop. It was much <span class="page-break" number="35"></span> Interview with Frank Hyde *deg May 4, 2013</p><p> more elaborate, it was more like a, I would say really full blown restaurant with a dancing --</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did your father lose his job?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I don't think he lost the job at that point. I think he retired, he was forced to retire. So he was home, my mother was always home. I don't know how they were making a living, I was -- but I remember the first salary which I got when I was working for that Jewish firm, naturally my obligation was to bring it home. That was understood. It was never thought by me tha -- or by the parents, that somehow I would take it and spend it somewhere. We were -- that was ex -- you know, that was anticipated and expected from you. Life was very different in those days. But it has changed, you know. I lost that job because ultimately he found out that I was Jewish, <span class="page-break" number="36"></span> Interview with Frank Hyde " May 4, 2013</p><p> or whatever, and it was [indecipherable] how could I have worked with somebody with a swastika, and all this stuff. Soon it became --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was his manner, though? Excuse me --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- it became worse.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. The manner of that person who ended up taking over the firm, with the swast -- did he -- was his manner arrogant, was he --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no -- well, that was his mentality. But you know, th-the -- the life has changed, what has changed? The laws have changed. So th -- we were playing that soccer. Everybody realize there was no restriction, no nothing. But gradually the non-Jewish population was put on such pressure, not to socialize with Jews --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- that all of a sudden your friends, were afraid to be your friends. So, the relationship has ceased. Everything became a separate society. The Jewish people were -- we had to wear Jewish stars, we had to be home at eight o'clock. So there were certain restrictions which were put on the Jewish population, which became, you know, like what they call here [indecipherable] it didn't happen overnight, but it was, you know. The first thing, for example, that I remember, as a kid I used to play the violin. Well, don't ask me what day, what year, but all of a sudden we were supposed to submit all those musical instruments to a certain place. Well, but it's not <span class="page-break" number="37"></span> ontactrefiranneGaushariarg a hither atrmedortabeattfiexaliaton Interview with Frank Hyde " May 4, 2013 that I didn't agree, you -- you were afraid not to agree. So you did what you were doing, because the Catholic population, they could not help you, because they were afraid themselves. So, the -- the -- the hostilities, or the violence, increased. So that there was a distinct difference between the Jewish population, and the non-Jewish population. And the very first transport, as I remember, a cousin of mine, he was much older than I was, but that's not the issue, the only reason I'm saying it, because with his wife, somehow they had no children. She -- she lost a child and she couldn't have more children, or whatever, they were one of the first ones to be deported to a Polish ghetto which was called Ledz, l-o-d-z, is a town in Poland.</p><p>They survived there until a certain time, when that was also liquidated, and he wound up in Auschwitz. Lost his leg in Auschwitz and everything else, but they came back after the war, and -- because so few people survived, I was reasonably close to them at one point, you know. Remember, the age was different, he was born 1900, and I was born 1921, so it's 20 years different. So when we came back, I was only 22, 24, he was already close to 50.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So there was a different. But eventually they also left for Austria. Austria was very helpful. <span class="page-break" number="38"></span> Interview with Frank Hyde % May 4, 2013</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay, let's go back then, to life gradually changing, and there's this separation between the Jews and the non-Jews, and a marginalization, from what I'm seeing, you're put on the margins of society, where you're not --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- allowed to do things that you were allowed to do before. When did -- let me go back even before that. Did you know Georgine by that time?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, not from childhood, but when she was maybe 14 - 15, and I was four years older, you know. Now, what the Jewish people did, or at least our group did, there was somebody who -- the father had the wholesale business, and the wholesale business was in a building which he owned, in the old section of Prague, not far from where I was growing up. And they used to go to that house to dance. But remember, in those days we talk about zillion years back.</p></p></dialogue>

So when those border countries had to be given back to Germany, because sh -- they came back. So, naturally they were Jewish, and we were Jewish, so somehow there were more of these girls, who came back from these countries, so we were, all of a sudden, instead of six people, we were say 12 people or 14 people. And we used to go to dance -- I don't remember its name, but that's not important.

So number one they had to move out of their house, their house was given to some German family, a -- a lieutenant or whatever he was, you know.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, no, no, it was -- well, no. Used to go to dance, like I said.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The marriage didn't happen that way.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did it happen?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The marriage happened because all of a sudden the edict came -- don't hold me to the numbers.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Five hundred men, 5,000 men, we had to report to be deported -- when you were single. So everybody who had a girlfriend got married. We didn't get married because we thought we would have children in the United States. We got married because we -- once you were married, you postponed the deportation. Now, under those circumstances which existed at that time, everything in your life at the time, <span class="page-break" number="42"></span> Interview with Frank Hyde %deg May 4, 2013</p><p> was to delay the deportation, because you knew where you were, but you did not know what will come once you go. So you did anything to delay the deportation. So if you -- if you look at the calendar, you will remember that in 1941, when we got married, Pearl Harbor happened.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So we thought, oh my gosh, now the United States will go to war with the -- it will be over before we go.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So everything was done to delay that thing. Now, since you were married all of a sudden, whether it was this girlfriend, or this -- or vice versa, from the girl's point of view, we got married. Now, of course, the circumstances were very, very different already. Number one, we had to wear a Jewish star. Transportation, there was hardly any in place. Now the streetcars, which we had at that --- remember, we talk about 1939 - 1940, so different now, no doubt. But at the time we had streetcars. And the streetcars, the entrance was in the middle. So there was a front part, and a rear part.</p><p>So the Jewish people had naturally to be in the rear part.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What's the neighborhood?</p></p></dialogue>

And sh -- I don't know if it was her house, or an apartment, I don't remember that, but I know it was supposed to -- that's where we had our quote, wedding celebration, if you want to call it. But all this was in a very, very limited way.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Of course.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Because the circumstances were not to allow you to do something ostentiously(ph) or something --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: --no. But we got married in October 1941, and like I just told you, because so many young men were supposed to report -- let's call it to Madison Square Garden <span class="page-break" number="44"></span> Interview with Frank Hyde * May 4, 2013</p><p> for work. Now once you were married, you still reported, but you were not deported.</p><p>Now the deportation were already taking place. Now, if I may inject something --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Sure.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- what I was doing when I quote lost my accounting job? You had to work. If you didn't work, you didn't get your stamps, which you needed to buy food, so we had to work. So naturally you had no choice what you would like to do for work.</p><p>You were told what to do. Now, you have to realize that some of these Jewish people, including her father, mother, when they were deported, they left behind this, let's say. So that had to be emptied, because the landlord wanted to rent it. so he couldn't rent it when all the stuff was there. So I was assigned to a unit which was emptying out sewing machines. [horn sound] My ear?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, this were --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It's a car outside.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The -- the sewing machines in those days were heavy clunkers. I don't know if you remember that, they were, you know, big stuff. Iron. Not like now plastic, and you put it on the table</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, yeah, yeah. <span class="page-break" number="45"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Frank Hyde deg May 4, 2013</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: So mirrors, pictures and sewing machines were a -- were taken out of those apartment and they were stored in a large synagogue in a suburb of Prague. I was in that unit which was doing this --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Work.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- work. Now, since we had pictures from the Jewish family -- at that time, if you remember, maybe you don't remember, because your age, west Europe was already under the attack by British, maybe American planes. So some of these planes hit German households. So the German government gave these burned-out families, something what we have here, what we call food stamps. Now, they were not having food stamps, but they had stamps to buy certain things, to reestablish them in Prague, or wherever they were living. Now, let's shall -- talk about Prague, because that's where I was active. So when they came, and they had these stamps, coupons, or whatever it was, that they could buy two paintings. Now, naturally they didn't pay for it, they gave you that stamps in return. But there was no gallery, like here in a gallery, you know, you -- that was a pile of paintings, that it was segregated between certain items of paintings; animals, or flowers, or whatever. They -- in German they call it stil leben.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Stil leben, yeah. <span class="page-break" number="46"></span> Interview with Frank Hyde *deg May 4, 2013</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So, I remember that when these people came in, they wanted to have a stil leben for their dining room, so I had to hold it, because they wanted to look at it. So when I was holding it, you know, that's how you hold stil -- why do I mention it? So when we got married, in October 1941, and I was still working for that Jewish organization, assembling the sewing machine, pictures, and all that stuff. So when we had to report to, quote, Madison Square Garden, there was naturally an SS guy who directed the -- the people, the traffic where you had to check in, where you had to go. Somehow he remembered that he was buying -- buying a painting that -- which I was holding. So, h-he called me out from the deportation, and he said, you stay here. So naturally then -- remember, I spoke perfectly German, I had German schools, and then you --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- improve it, because everything was German. So I was telling him that I have also a wife here. So somehow we found where Georgine was, and the delay, again, everything was always delay, delay, delay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What about your parents? Were they --</p></p></dialogue>

So, we were delayed, not by a long time, no, but it was a delay.</p><p>Week, or something, whatever. You talk about my parents. My sister worked for the Jewish government, the government which was connected to the German government. Don't forget, the Germans didn't do any orders, they gave the orders to the Jewish government. So there was a Jewish police, there was a Jewish this -- everything -- not everything, of course, but within certain -- so my sister was working for that Jewish organization, call it the Jewish government. And that was primarily because, if you remember I told you, that person who came into our house where we were living. So he knew my mother, he knew my sister --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: This Edelstein(ph)?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Edelstein(ph). So he was delaying their deportation. So they stayed [indecipherable] in Prague much longer than I and Georgine, or her parents.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Got it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: How long [indecipherable] how long, but you know, eventually they also came to Theresienstadt, just like my sister. But sh -- my sister, from the job in Prague, she had the same job in Theresienstadt, because --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was that job?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- she was working for the Jewish government.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You know, don't forget they had -- they had statistics, they knew how many people they killed. I tell you they knew exactly how they killed. They had system, and if you read back, you know, the papers what I have here -- I will have to look for it to show it to you, tru -- they knew my transportation number when I was, well, with Georgine, when we left Prague for Theresienstadt, the -- the transport had a name, the transport had a number. We had a number. I don't remember the number, of course, but I have papers here to show you. So, my parents were actually deported later.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: They -- they perished, of course, just like everybody perished. But they -- later th -- they lived a little longer, let's say, before they got into Auschwitz, and Auschwitz was, of course, the end of it. Because you, when you were in Auschwitz, and you came with a train, and in front of you stood that doctor, whatever his name was. And he decided as you go this way, or that way. Natch -- now, you have to realize, I like to tell you, we know now when we say the word Auschwitz, we know what it is.</p><p>But you have to go back to 1941, when we got married, "42.

Now there wasn't that much space, nor that many beds or anything. So they constructed bunks, three on top of each other. So that was a terrible shortage of space. When you went to the bathroom, you had to have your container for soap, you went there, you know. It was not a bathroom in a sense, like you go here. So, it was very difficult. The crowds. You had to wait in line to get your food, you know. So when you come from a normal atmosphere like here -- and I don't mean my house per se --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah, yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- and then all of a sudden you have a regimented life, you have to be there seven o'clock, or nine o'clock, or whatever. And then you slept three on top of each other, which one are you going to go? On top, in the middle, or down below? So there were arguments among people, Jewish people, but don't forget, they were not only Jewish people there --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Of course. <span class="page-break" number="50"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Frank Hyde * May 4, 2013</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- there are also Jewish people from some other places, because it was supposed to be a model ghetto, and hit -- and Hitler was running the border over. So it became extremely crowded. Now, in that Theresienstadt, the first x months, I can't tell you how many months, but I was assigned to distribute coal, because I was working in the coal firm, so I was assigned to a coal job. What was the job? Well, all these people who were living in these places, they were assigned boxes, with the two handles here, two handles over there, and that you had to fill this -- this up with coal, and they took it in wherever they were staying. The houses were condr -- houses -- th-they were n-not houses like --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Barracks.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- you know, when -- shacks. But that was converted so that some people could have -- like there is mostly men, or mostly women, and they needed heat, so they were getting the coal. So, at one point, the -- you know, when -- when the coal normally was sold, or delivered, there used to be a little hut with a scale outside. So, because of my coal co-connections, I was given the use of that thing. So Georgine moved back in with me, in that --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Hut.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- hut, they call it.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Things like that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And then, in f-- March "43, well, we had to go.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Okay, so in Theresienstadt, you're there from March four --</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: --to September "44. What happened September "44? September 28 is a Czech holiday. So we were told that we have to build a new camp, always the new camp. I <span class="page-break" number="58"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Frank Hyde deg May 4, 2013 don't -- I can't -- what I don't know, I'Il tell you. I don't remember if it was 500, or 5,000 --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- or anything in between, men. So, we were assembled, and we had to -- we had to go to these open boxcars, which were full of coal that had to be taken out, the coal, and we had to go in. Then they took off March -- September 28, eastward.</p><p>Now, we knew that the American allied soldiers were coming westward, but they didn't get far enough for us to get out, whatever. So when the train was full of people, open boxcars, well, you know what people do, you know. People have to go to the bathroom, there is no food. I have to interject here something, because my friend out on Long Island, he always says, well, what about food? And I always tell him, Fernando, there were no dining cars, you know. But there's something else. So after we were traveling east -- northeast, there was somebody, as I remember it like today, in a stripe -- remember, Theresienstadt, we had our clothes. So that was also, you know, where you put it, and all that stuff. So there was always a shortage of space, and you intermingled stuff, and it wa -- it was really a source of trouble. But when we were traveling east, there was a guy in str-striped uniform. And we get out of those boxcars, where are you from? Because we wanted to know what camp is he <span class="page-break" number="59"></span> Interview with Frank Hyde *8 May 4, 2013</p><p> from. And he said Auschwitz. Now that didn't -- that's like if you would say something.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Didn't mean a thing. Well, we continued traveling for I don't know how many days. And finally we got in to something which we -- was called Auschwitz. But you know, again, the Germans, what they did, they tried to intimidate you right from the first moment you entered this whole area. The train didn't s-stop, yes, but not that everybody had to get out of the train. It took, I think, two days before they finally set everybody out of those boxcars, and get out. And the train was going around, around, and you had no idea, because there were no signs. You didn't know how -- where -- how come that we go around. Nobody was there to tell you anything, of course. So finally when we came to a stop, which was like, I would say, the couple of days after, October first, second, I don't know for sure. Well, we to get out, you know, orders in German. And my -- we were together, her father, the two uncles, the two doctors, and also some other relatives from her mother's side.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you toge -- was Georgine with you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no, no, no.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Her father-in-law. Was only men. <span class="page-break" number="60"></span> Interview with Frank Hyde " May 4, 2013</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So, well, we had to get out, and then you were confronted by that top German guy who was -- welcoming you, whatever. And he -- my father-in-law, he was saying that he's a -- he was not old, but in his mind, he was old. He was only 50 years, fif -- exactly 50 years, but you know, he lost his house, he lost his business, and everything else. So he felt he's old. So he was telling him in German that he's an old man. So he had to go this way. Well, the two brothers, the doctors, me and someone, this way. Well, once you are split, you try to find out what happened to the people who are the other way.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The other place.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, they to -- they told you here is gas chambers, crematoriums, and the only way out of here is through the chimney, you know. So, if you find out what happened to him, and well, then we were in Auschwitz. First the shoes had to be disinfected, so they put it into water. Well, this was intimidation, you know? So now you had shoes wet, icy cold. Auschwitz is in a very cold area of southern Poland, standing in those freezing temperatures, wet shoes, no coats, no nothing. They give you pants, but those pants are like, you know, his pants were, if he -- I don't mean your pants what you have on, but me that would be obviously, you know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. <span class="page-break" number="61"></span> Interview with Frank Hyde degdeg May 4, 2013</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But then you were assigned to a barrack. Those were stables for the Polish armed forces horses. Don't forget the time is still horses. So, if you had to have equipment, horses had to pull it, not a car. Gasoline was very difficult. So the -- the -- the -- the stables they had, seven floors, of course. And they were contructions(ph) for the horses, but contructions(ph). The size was just about like the table. Not high, I don't mean that, the s -- the size. And that was on the floor, and the edges were a little higher. So think of it as on the floor, but the end was a little higher.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Why was the end higher? Because the people had to put 0-oats into that contraption, so the oats were not all over.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Then the horses ate the oats, or whatever else they were eating. Now for us, the height was good because we put our head on it. There were no beds, like at Theresienstadt we had bed -- we had beds, we had bunks, but that was still --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It's still a space, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- regular -- you know. So that was -- th-that stuff on the floor, cold as it was, you know. It was awful, awful. So one of --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When did you find out --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- the uncles -- <span class="page-break" number="62"></span> Interview with Frank Hyde degdeg May 4, 2013</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- of Georgine, doctor.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He said, we don't stay here. Well, that's easier said than done.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Naturally. So he was -- he came up with this story that if they do nothing, they will not survive, because the cold weather, the food, no food, nothing. So he said that the best will be for us to say that we are locksmiths. And I always say that's the only lie I lied in my life, because I said I'm a locksmith. So we s -- but he figured that if we say we would be locksmiths, that they would send us into some kind of a factory, and it would be inside, rather than somewhere outside, digging roads, or something.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right, right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, he was right. They were always -- they were always counting how many are alive, and all that stuff, in Auschwitz.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When did -- where -- again, I'll go back a little bit. In Theresienstadt, what was the mortality like? Were there a lot of people who --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Ire -- don't know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I mean, did you see people dying -- <span class="page-break" number="63"></span> Interview with Frank Hyde *" May 4, 2013</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Of -- of course, old people, we used, of course [indecipherable]. Of course, the old people were dying, but they were buried.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Sure. And I think they started with Auschwitz from Theresienstadt, because I think really the Germans were concerned that maybe some disease, or some uprising might happen, you know, over the multitude of people, you know, and now, of course, they had th -- they had the weapons, we had nothing, of course.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But they would have to shoot.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: All that blood, and all that mess which would probably happen. So they started with the deportation out of Theresienstadt, you know? I think that was the main reason, apart from getting rid of the Jewish population.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you didn't know where Georgine was?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Sorry?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: At -- at that time, you didn't --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no, no.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- you didn't know where Georgine -- <span class="page-break" number="64"></span> Interview with Frank Hyde 8 May 4, 2013</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We left Georgine and her mother behind. They followed, because that -- the excuse was, you want to follow your husbands, your brothers, you can go tomorrow.</p><p>So three days later, she went with her mother, the same way. Of course, she never saw her mother again, because again, the age, you know. But Georgine was shipped to a Russian camp from Auschwitz.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Where was she shipped?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: She was called -- it was called Gross-Rosen.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Ah, to Gross-Rosen, okay, mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's where she stayed until the end of the war. But she was always sick, you know, women are very different, in case you don't know. The women body is a very different body than a man's body, so she -- she came back, she was sick from day one. Of course, she came back to Prague, where I was, you know, first thing hospital. She had to be put back into a normal stage, which she wasn't.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So-</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But Auschwitz, you know, then we were locksmiths.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, locksmiths.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You remember, my name was Pekarek?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. <span class="page-break" number="65"></span> Interview with Frank Hyde degdeg May 4, 2013</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So, at one time, we had to, again, assemble to go -- there was no travel agent, you know, they told you have to get out of the thing, and you were standing there, then they told you will be transported someplace, so the tr -- they call the names. Now, lots of people changed their names, not legally. Why? Because they were afraid in case they would be punished or beaten up, or whatever. They might have ramification to the family somewhere else.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So, lots of young men changed the name from A to B, or B to C. I didn't change mine, I was still Pekarek. And -- but the -- the transportation, the first transportation stopped at K, and because I was Pekarek, they were F, Feldmans --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- they left, and I stayed behind. Because there were only so many empty on the train --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- to go wherever. So, we met only after the war with those people again. They survived, and I survived, as a locksmith, but not in the same place. Reasonably, you would say like I was in Muncie, and they were in Poborno(ph), or something like that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah, yeah. <span class="page-break" number="66"></span> ontactrefiranneGaushariarg a hither atrmedortabeattfiexaliaton Interview with Frank Hyde " May 4, 2013</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Of course, you couldn't travel freely, that was out of question. But I cus -- I stayed behind, unfortunately, and because I stayed behind, you always have to do something what they told you to do. So for maybe about a month, or six weeks or so, I had to -- I was assigned to a group which was taking out the dead bodies from the gas chambers, which had to be taken to the crematorium. You didn't like to leave dead bodies in the gas chambers, you had to go to the crematorium and burn them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>And then, you know, th-the ashes was nothing. So the -- the transportation took place on a--I don't know how you would call it, it had two Vs on each side, and a piece of wood was like this, you know? We were not so strong, I can't tell you how many we had to push always to get to the gas chambers. Take the bodies out, put them on that stretcher [indecipherable] and transport them to the crematorium. Well, that went on for some time, I would say maybe about a couple of -- maybe about a month or SO.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Wasn't it a shock?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, sweetheart, that was life at that time. Then -- then he finished, and the transportations then again, was through that -- where I was, as a locksmith. If you have a huge map of Germany, you probably found town one in --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah. <span class="page-break" number="67"></span> Interview with Frank Hyde " May 4, 2013</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: --on the map. It was called Meuselwitz. Very close to where Uncle Bert was with his brother, but not in Mosul, it's a very different place. And you were working there from six to six.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And what did you do there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: What I did after that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No, no, no, in Meuselwitz.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: What I was doing -- it was a huge machine. We were producing casings for the German navy. You had a machine you p-put -- remember, I was a locksmith, so you pressed it, the thing was about this big -- not that --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- you know, maybe bigger, but narrower. And you had a bucket, and that -- you had to fill up the bucket. I can't tell you how many buckets a day, or whatever, from six to six. Well, then you went back to where you were supposed to be housed, but it was temporary shelter, really. Was no bed. Was just one thing big from there to hear, and today you slept here, tomorrow you slept there. Boys or old men only. And in the morning you did the same thing. Six to six. And I have to tell you how I got out, because really that was what people always say, well, who -- who -- who liberated you. And I have to say, I was not liberated in that sense. Remember what I <span class="page-break" number="68"></span> ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion Interview with Frank Hyde " May 4, 2013 was telling you is the truth.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You came back to where?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: To -- where we were sleeping.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Ah, so in Meuselwitz, you're still --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: From the factory --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: To the place.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- they took us back to where we were sleeping.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: But instead of sleeping, we had to empty a tray of briquettes. You know what briquettes are? Briquettes are about this big. So we had to empty that tray from the briquettes. Well, then -- then that [indecipherable] the tables, and they threw the briquettes, they chased us in. So again, you know, you are in a train, like my friend always, what about food, what about food? First of all, we were already dehydrated, the body was stopped, like you sitting here --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: --or I'm sitting here. I don't know how many pounds we had, but food was not really the item which bothered you, so to speak. So then she starts back into the <span class="page-break" number="69"></span> Interview with Frank Hyde s May 4, 2013</p><p> train, and the train took off east, just like from Theresienstadt east, this time from Meuselwitz, Germany, east. Away from those upcoming American soldiers.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: One point here, I just want to establish. So, if | understand properly, you were in Auschwitz for about two months or so?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I was there longer than that. I got to -- in Auschwitz in September 28, so we got there like, I would say, October first.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And out of Auschwitz, somewhere around Christmastime.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay, okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So I would say about three months.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Three months. Three months.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And then from Christmas to the quote, liberation where I'm trying to tell you --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- in Meuselwitz.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In Meuselwitz, okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Now the Meuselwitz didn't have any accommodation, like I just said --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- it was -- you know why? Because the German people, they were very all -- either on the east front, or west front, and they needed the manpower, so they were <span class="page-break" number="70"></span></p><p>They were heading west, we were heading east. It's like that, okay. I was like this, they were on this side. So my particular boxcar, we were told to get out of the boxcar so that they could count how we are still in the boxcar are living, because some people are die out of hydration, age, malnutrition, sickness. So they always counting. So while we were standing alongside our railroad car, next to us was a German car, right? I mean, the British bombers came by, and they started to dive, and started to shoot. Now, you know when you are up there and you starting to shoot, you don't shoot like this, you shoot like this, you know? So that you kill as many opponents you can kill. So there was a panic at that moment. We were out of the car. So, we -- wi -- wi [indecipherable] if you want to call it free. That's not the right word, but no supervision at that moment. So that was a hill, and I always call it <span class="page-break" number="71"></span> Interview with Frank Hyde (r) May 4, 2013</p><p> the same like here. You know, you have a hill behind you, and you had to run up the hill, because you wanted to get away from the shooting. So we were -- remember, I was -- 1945, I was what, 24 years. So, you had the different stamina to run than you would have now that I'm 91. So we were running up. When I say we, there was always somebody who was closer to you. I remember one guy, his name, but I don't remember the other two who were running, Czechs, with us.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So we got up on top of the hill. Now we were realizing that we didn't have any German guard watching us, right? We were free. Free, without any passport, without any papers, striped uniform. So free is a different thing for free. And that -- and the train, which I told you, the British bombers started to bomb. Eventually they hit the train. So there was a tremendous commotion. But we wound up on the top of the hill. So that -- what are we going to do? Are we going to stay here, get organized, or going back, or whatever. So we decided four of us, cold as it was, that we will stay overnight, and then we will think what we do the nec -- next day. So we decided one day to stay up on the hill, and maybe two nights, I don't remember for sure any more. But we decided to go back, because we thought, we had no papers, we had nothing. Where are we going to go? Not that we had anywhere to go down there, but at least we were not fugitives from -- <span class="page-break" number="72"></span> Interview with Frank Hyde % May 4, 2013</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- where we were. So we went down the hill, and as we were coming down the hill, believe it or not, our train took off. So we -- we really lost the train. The prisoners who were still there. We took only about one car, which was where we were. The rest was still inside. So, we left the train -- so we, when we saw the train moving, we ducked a little, to be sure that they don't start shooting. And they left, and we went back to the hill. So we were on that hill [indecipherable] Fernando will buy the food. I said, oh Fernando, there was no food, there was no service, that's for sure. But anyhow, we went back to the hill, and we stayed there another two days.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No food, nothing, yeah?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Thinking where to go, how to go, what excuse.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You know, the roads were all occupied by what we have here, National Guard, or what do we call it here?</p></p></dialogue>

So finally we decided we take a chance, we have to do it, because we don't live indefinitely on top of the hill. So we went down, a short enough distance, like you would say, maybe further down, maybe [indecipherable]. Sure enough, there was a station, this we -- soldiers with -- three, four soldiers with guns. So we put our hands up right away, that they don't start shooting. That's the approach, then w-we told them exactly what I'm telling you, that we were Czech workers, on work in Germany, in that factory where we were, and that our clothes was damaged in that attack, and that's what we saved, is what we have on. Well, you have -- you have to put you into jail, you have to see the magistrate the next day. So we were now in -- in a regular jail. Well, if you have a brain injury -- and I hope not [indecipherable] but it was the first time a regular jail.</p><p>There was discarded clothes. So, what we did, we took, instead of our prison clothes, we took the discarded clothes which was left there by whoever.

The story was that we are Czech workers, that we were -- of course, we spoke German, that we were caught on the train, which was bombed by the British and we got -- you know, we were trying to get somewhere, out of, you know, where we were. Now, the most unexpected thing happen. The magistrate said that, you suffered enough, You are free to go wherever you want to go.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So he didn't believe your story?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well -- well, he let us go. So we were free. So then, coming back to Prague, how do you get back?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, did you then have a paper, or a stamp, or something.</p></p></dialogue>

The -- the cars which were allowed to take what I am telling you, they had <span class="page-break" number="75"></span> Interview with Frank Hyde &gt;&gt; May 4, 2013</p><p> to cut out the passenger seat. The driver, was a driver, but the passenger seat was taken out, and they put in something like you would say, a contraption, with wooden chips. And the wooden chips had to be put on fire, and they produce a little bit of steam, and the steam produce the car to go. So when we tried to get to Prague hi -- not hijacking, ja -- jack -- how you call it here, when you --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Hitchhiking.</p></p></dialogue>

So, a truck, which was something I remember like today, like a pickup truck, he stopped. Where do you want to go? Of course we said Prague, and he said he goes to Prague, too, but his truck -- where we were was a very hilly country. So he said, most likely the truck will not make it, you will have to get out, and have to push the thing to get over the</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Hill.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So we took seven days to get back to Prague, because he had only that thing on the side, producing the -- the s -- the steam.

And shower, bathroom, because we had lice. If you know what lice does, you know, they crawl all over you. So, naturally she was afraid that we bring the lice into her home. So first was the bathroom, you know, staying there because how many hours, to kill the lice. And then a cup of tea. But you couldn't get out of that house, because we didn't have any papers, so we were afraid if you get -- we -- I was afraid, if you get out, you know, that somebody could stop us. And then what?

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: She was married to a non-Jew, but that actually it was a surprise that she somehow managed not to be involved, because that was not an excuse. She was Jewish, so under normal circumstances of that time, she would have had the same <span class="page-break" number="82"></span> Interview with Frank Hyde *deg May 4, 2013</p><p> difficulties. But for some strange reason, nobody knew. The neighbors, of course, Czech. She married somebody by the name of Krejeik(ph).</p></p></dialogue>

You have to clean yourself, and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- wash up yourself. There's something which didn't exist in Australia -- ah, in Australia, in -- in -- in Auschwitz. There were no bathrooms, you know, there was a piece of wood, and you had to sit down and do what you did, and there was no water. So you really -- you personal esteem, or hygiene, or whatever you want to call it, was absolutely nonexistent, you know. Just think of it, what she was talking about, that underwear. Well you, when you are in that kind of a cold weather, and you are not properly dressed, your nose is running con-constantly. So, at one time they were, probably as a make you feel miserable, or whatever, out of that prayer shawl, they made shorts. So -- which I started to tell you earlier.

But all these people were older than we both were, so eventually we are just by ourselves.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Nose.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- their noses. I wanted to go back a little bit further, even before you're deported, because from what I understand now, you lived really, several years under Nazi rule in Prague.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. <span class="page-break" number="86"></span> Interview with Frank Hyde "deg May 4, 2013</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So during that time, what was -- what was -- did you -- what did you hear about Richard Heydrich, who was the leader -- I mean, who was Hitler's man in Prague?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>What did you know of him?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, of course I remember the name, H-Heydrich, of course. Well, one experience comes right to your mind. When he was killed, and they were looking around for those parti-partisans, they used to call them, who they suspected killed him, well, we were living in an apartment -- we were married, of course, and we were living in an apartment which was assigned to us, because the parents had to move out of the house where they were -- lived. And they were assigned to another Jewish family, which was, as soon as you remember Prague a little bit, near the Charles bridge.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Bridge.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So we were living in that neighborhood, and I do -- I don't know what I was doing, but most likely working for the Jewish organization -- I shouldn't call it that way, but that's the way it was.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, it sounds like an authority. Like an authority --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Jewish authority would be a better word.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. <span class="page-break" number="87"></span> Interview with Frank Hyde " May 4, 2013</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And I remember we were, of course, sleeping, and all of a sudden somebody burst into that room -- I don't know if they were soldiers, or SS soldiers, that I don't remember, but they were moving the furniture, which was not ours, which was, we had the furnished room. They were looking for some hidden escape routes which these partisans might have taken. That was the middle of the night, whether it was 10 - 12, that I don't remember, but I remember very well when they came.</p><p>Naturally, we were scared to death in bed, sleeping and all of a sudden somebody is there with weapons, and go -- moving the furniture to see whether it's a hidden staircase to go somewhere where that person might have been hiding.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But ultimately, of course, they didn't -- didn't find anything, they left. But it was very difficult. The -- the conditions became worse. I don't mean living conditions like eating, no. It was more the freedom of moving around, yes. Because you were supposed to have the yellow star, and if they caught you without wearing it, without having the documents which a non-Jew had to produce, you -- it was punishable.</p><p>And the office which I was working at, was just across from the headquarter of the Gestapo. So we had the -- I have seen many things which normally people would not have seen, you know, that --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Such as? <span class="page-break" number="88"></span> Interview with Frank Hyde " May 4, 2013</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, the trucks with the prisoners, and the mistreating of prisoners getting into the building, and all this stuff. Was awful. That building was originally a bank, and it was owned by a Jewish person. The name was called -- like you have here Citibank, so that was called the Petschek bank. And he was known, you know, like you know here Rockefeller, so he was known there as Petschek the banker, you know. But what you have seen, yes, e-every 12 o'clock, a new guard came to replace the guard from the day before. So you have seen the power, the might what they had at that time. The streets were -- that particular location was at, that had all American presidents there. It was a Hoover Street, it was a Wilson Street, and there were more of them.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You see, when the president wants to relax, we -- whichever president, they don't go into politics, you went to Camp David because that was the summer, or the relaxation for the existing president. So we had that Castle Lany. And Heydrich was known that he travels between Lany and Prague, because he wanted to enjoy the same thing like --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- the president enjoyed that Lany, you know, the castle which was there.

But it was big repercussions, yeah, because he was really the right hand of Hitler.

Now, I don't know if they have changed it since then, or whatever, but there's a strong Czech community in Chicago, and they wanted to show that somehow the -- the west stands with that particular event. But, of -- of course I remember it, and there were pictures of Heydrich left and right. He was the right hand of Hitler, no doubt about it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Now in -- now, when they burst in in the middle of the night, that means it wasn't the same night that heyd -- or the same day that Heydrich had been attempted --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, we had aft -- well, they were looking for the n-- you know --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right, for days.</p></p></dialogue>

So it's not like th-the people were against you. No, I told you, my best friend, he was playing soccer with me. Who cares whether he was Jewish or Catholic, or whatever. But the fear was there. So, out of fear, there was a certain -- call it segregation.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And -- and it was imposed by -- by the system, you know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay, now let's jump to after the war. When you came back, how did life develop for you out of your sister-in-law's apartment? After that, you get better, it's</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I told you, somehow -- I don't know how I got the apartment, because there were also Germans who were thrown awa -- not thrown away, but they made them go back to Germany, or whatever. So I don't know how I got the apartment.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>Certainly didn't pay for it, I had no money, I was a kid. Was it allotted to me by someone? I don't remember that part. I know I stayed with Georgine until -- and then her aunt, the one they were talking about, the close, she came to visit us when she was expecting George, the one who is a doctor near Washington, D.C. She was expecting him, and that was the first time she came to Prague and the first time they met her, so to speak.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Also, excuse me, we haven't talked about how did Georgine come back? <span class="page-break" number="93"></span> Interview with Frank Hyde " May 4, 2013</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, Georgine, I don't know how she came back, physically, but I think, which I mentioned to you, the French were trying desperately to put people together.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Now, if you think who paid for it, definitely nobody. That was the government's somehow obligation, or whatever. Georgine was sick, and I remember very distinctly, when she came, there were two of her good, best friends who really made her survive. Did I remember the name? One was, I think, Ruth but they call her Chekruthka(ph), and I forgot the second one. But they were not from Prague, so they stayed in Prague for a couple of days before they got the connection to wherever they going. One was through Moravia --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- which was the other state of Czechoslovakia. And | think they lost, you know, like always you lost track of each other, because people have different interests, and Georgine, she needed surgeries. She developed a thyroid condition. The thyroid is not only that it takes away your breathing, but also she developed a [indecipherable] on the -- on this side. That would be her left side, I think it was. So she had to have that taken out. It was not taken out in Czechoslovakia, but she was treated from it. Always the truth, it was taken out when we came here, in New York City. Not at the hospital, there used to be small op -- small practices. That was done <span class="page-break" number="94"></span> Interview with Frank Hyde 8 May 4, 2013</p><p> on Park Avenue. Don't hold me to it, but I remember it was on 83"C/ Street, I think, between Park and Madison, closer to Park. And it had to be taken out, because the doctor said here that she would -- she would have difficulties. Now, come to think of it, why was it not done in Australia? She had it in Australia. But, you know, Australia of 19 -- when we got there, 1949, was a different Australia than 2013.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They were very backwards. Not because they were dumb or something, it was the location. They were so far away from anything, that i-it --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: --it was -- it was a different Australia. That's why we also changed the name, because when I said my name is Pekarek, it was like talking to, you know, God knows what. So i-it was -- it was very difficult. Then, since she was here, she read her -- that the treatment here is much more progressive, with nuclear energy.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I want to go back to when she comes back to Prague.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, please.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. She's sick. Did you meet her -- did she return back to your -- her sister's apartment as well, and that's where you met her?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, but we had the -- we had the apartment which I told you I got in central Prague. <span class="page-break" number="95"></span> Interview with Frank Hyde " May 4, 2013</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Iknow, but your first meeting, when she comes back, do you remember it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I don't think I remember exactly the first couple of days, not really.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. No, so you ha -- all right. And -- and what -- but when she does come back, she's very sick --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- and so she needs treatment.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And had you had your apartment that you were assigned, already by that time?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see. Okay.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So eventually she did come back. Now how did she find me? Well, most likely through her sister.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: That's my guessing now --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A:--70 years later.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: They claim -- there's a story to it also, they got it back because that [indecipherable] was theirs. <span class="page-break" number="97"></span> ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion Interview with Frank Hyde m May 4, 2013</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And we -- even if we had the left le -- leaning government, it was theirs, they got it back. And -- since they were quite well off, and they had connections to the United States. How? The original owner was a very old man. He had quite a few children. In those days, you know, there were not so many precautions not to get children, or pregnant, or whatever. So he had, I think, five or six of them. And two were living here in the United States very -- before the war started. One was in Philadelphia, and I don't know where the other one was living. So, they got the thing back, but because it was so left-leaning, the whole Czechoslovakia after World War II, because the Soviet Union, we were your protectors, and the country was really very much to the left, which we didn't care for. So this firm had difficulties with the labor force, because they were delivering coal, c-o-a-I-Il -- you know, coal?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: But in Prague, coal was the thing to make your morning coffee.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And the owner was an old man, he had several sons, but two of them worked in the firm. And it was a very successful firm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay, so now when they come back, they reclaim their firm, do they -- if -- what did -- do they eventually leave it, because you're talking about this left-leaning government?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, yes, that's what I wanted to tell you.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: One of -- so when -- when -- when this more left-leaning, more left-wingish. So eventually -- I don't remember if this was nationalized or not, those things escape me.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. So let's go back to left leaning government in Prague. The owners are not happy, they don't want to stay. What makes you not happy? What specifically?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The left-wingish thing. Look, you -- for example, there were elections.

So you didn't -- you didn't like the way you saw things developing back in Prague.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Exactly. That was the truth.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah. What did you -- what actions did you start taking? How did things develop</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Now see, that I couldn't take any --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- from thought to action?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A:--I---I didn't take any, except that I want to get out with Georgine. And being of that age, military age -- now, for example, when I came back, I had to join the army.</p><p>Not that I wanted, that was a compulsory --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: --so for, I don't remember how many months, I was -- I was within the army office, but still I was in the armed forces</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And then they passed a law that people who were in a concentration camp, were exempt from that service. So I came back to the apartment which I had --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: - originally with Georgine. So Georgine came to visit me, how she got there, I don't know, most likely by bus, because we didn't have a car. Have a car was a <span class="page-break" number="104"></span> 108 Interview with Frank Hyde May 4, 2013 luxury in those days. So she must have come by bus to visit me, and naturally there was a question of money, because when you are in the military, you don't make -- what do you make? Nothing. So there were some difficulties. Do I remember what difficulties? Not really. Somehow we made it. You know, maybe some money was left over from the father -- her father. But you know, the -- during that kind of a situation that's happening here to someb -- not want to touch that that base, but when people -- my father-in-law, when -- when they heard that this one was transported to some camp, and this one -- so, as a precaution, they gave -- they had a housekeeper of the house, which was living in the basement, so to speak. So they gave her some money. How much? No idea. He had a factory. Remember, the time goes back now, 60 -- 70 years. So plastic was a novelty. So, in Czechoslovakia, when you had -- when you bought a drink, let's say like a Coke. Was not a Coke, like a Coke. So it has a top that you closed, you know, but it was the old-fashioned thing, which was very difficult and maybe not nice looking. So he did a lot, with a partner, plastic -- you know --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Screw top.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- th-the tops which we today take for granted, you know, and [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah. <span class="page-break" number="105"></span> 109 Interview with Frank Hyde May 4, 2013</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So it was a novelty, and he was doing extremely well. So he gave his housekeeper X -- no idea how much -- dollar, but you keep it, and then they come back -- you know, you give it back to us. Well, there are lots of people who didn't come back. In that connection, I would like to refer to a story which appeared in "The Wall Street Journal" not more than maybe two weeks ago, and I gave it to Elise to read. Why? Because it turned out that New York state, there are unclaimed insurance policies, monies which were left around in banks. In the bill -- b -- in the billions. And the story was that New York state can get this if it stays unclaimed, because there is a law, if you don't claim X after so many years, it becomes the property of the state. So naturally, New York state, I can imagine if they could get a couple of million, perhaps billion, oh my gosh, you know?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: So that was the story, and I have no doubt, insurance companies, banks, and I'm telling to you out of experience, Georgine knew that her father had the life insurance policy with X --I forgot the name. So when we came here, we tried to get in touch with those people, we found some document showing that he had this, and he had that, and whatever. So the answer which we got, if I would look for it, I would find it. I'm not going to take the time now --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah, yeah. <span class="page-break" number="106"></span> Interview with Frank Hyde " May 4, 2013</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: --and I will not take the time then either. But they responded that we have to produce a death certificate. Now, to get a death certificate for somebody who passed away in Auschwitz, is like -- I don't have to tell you. So nothing happened. But that means that that policy was never consummated. So, if he was entitled to those benefits, 10,000 - 100,000, whatever, that was never paid. So really, the unclaimed amounts which are there, must be in the -- well, I'm telling you, the story was -- they mentioned ski -- I think, two billion dollars. Because I'm sure my father-in-law wasn't the only person who did this.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But you're talking -- when you're talking about where they were unclaimed, it was in the -- Czechoslovakia where it was unclaimed?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, yeah, in Czechoslovakia, yeah, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, yeah. Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, but there's -- if the money would have been somehow, say inherited by Georgine, or -- or somehow --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. That's right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: --it would have come --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Come to --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- or maybe to her sister while she was still in the uni --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. <span class="page-break" number="107"></span> Interview with Frank Hyde m May 4, 2013</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was never paid, because we could not prove --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: His death.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- his death. And I'm sure there were cases, God knows how many, because lots of people didn't come back, especially older people, you know, the young people might have survived [indecipherable] about the older people had no chance. So we're -- I'm just telling you what happened in "Wall Street Journal," which I enjoy reading, but that's not the issue. So the situation was -- it was varied. It was not the same Czechoslovakia, like it was when it was founded. No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Wer -- were you still there when Jan Masaryk was killed?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, yes, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What can you tell us about that, and what happened to -- how did you experience it, what did you --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, we experienced only that somehow he jumped to his death. That was the official version. Now, the unofficial version was that they threw him out of the window.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Now, what was true? That depends on what side you are on.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: What do -- were people frightened to speak to one another? <span class="page-break" number="108"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 112 Interview with Frank Hyde May 4, 2013</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yes. Oh, definitely, because you didn't know what the other person would do to enhance his position, whatever he was doing, he or she, yes. It was not the same Czechoslovakia, no. And that is in a way part of what you're asking me, why didn't -- it was not just this threat from the Soviet Union, we didn't have anything, so what would I have taken, and we just came back. But it was everything, you know, the distrust of each other. The quality of life wasn't the same. By far not the same.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>Religion, the religion we didn't practice a religion anyhow, so that didn't make any different. But the life was not the same, no. You talked to a neighbor, you were afraid in case you say something, it might be turned over against you. If you were more on the liberal side, rather than communistic side. If you said you don't like -- I'm just saying --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: --as an example, if you didn't like this guy, and he was a prominent, say politician, Prague, or whatever. So i-it was not the same country, by any mean. But it was not the same country for two reasons. Unfortunately, the German occupation did it, and the Russian threat continued during it. So that was not that [indecipherable] who were the -- originally the spirit. That was -- was missing, that wasn't there. And specially this aunt of mine, who survived the war in Israel, it was not Israel, it was Palestine. It's the same thing anyway. <span class="page-break" number="109"></span> Interview with Frank Hyde ns May 4, 2013</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So she didn't like it, and she was alerting us to these things more than we did, because we were thrilled that we are free. We were free. So, for us, we didn't see it.</p><p>But she s -- she was, like I say, a different oy -- age, from a different country. She saw it differently, you know? The way she was living, I remember certain things, that she was living in Vienna, she married in Vienna. And she came to Prague with her husband, and sh -- I can't tell you the year. Oh, it must have been before "39, before Hitler came. She was saying that this is a unstoppable wave, that anything what is somehow German, will become Nazi German. And I think she was right.</p><p>Why? I told you earlier, because Hitler provided jobs, and even the people who were -- who had nothing to do with it, became pro-Nazi. I like to say Nazi Germany, because I don't blame today's generation for what happened 50 - 70 years ago. Le -- I mean, these people who are today Germans -- I mean, of course they are German, because they were born there, I mean, they questioned their old grandparents. I mean, how could you have not known, or why could you have condoned this, you know? Different from today's world than it was at the time, but when I talk about Germany, I usually say Nazi Germany, or Germany.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. <span class="page-break" number="110"></span> Interview with Frank Hyde m May 4, 2013</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because I'm getting a pension, small pension, couple hundred dollars. Really, it's not even worth talking about it. Depends on the exchange rate. So Georgine got for the month of May, 200 dollars, and I got five -- 200 dollars, another 500 dollars, something, you know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So today, in this world, 700 dollars amounts -- is not going to make me rich or poor. Yes, it helps me to maintain Georgine, which I told you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But those article, they had nothing to do with the Holocaust. Those articles, they're like John's age, or even younger.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Imean, why should they [indecipherable] they, through taxation, pay me X dollars? Well, I'm looking at it, I'm telling you how I feel about it.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Laccept thing, well yes, I accept it, because I was working there and all that rubbish did happen. But you -- I'm wondering why this generation stole everything?</p><p>Do they feel any moral guilt? Where -- would I feel moral guilt, what my grandfather might have done? I don't know. I'm just asking a civilized question, you know?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. Yeah. It's one question that is -- it's -- there's so many questions in these events, that -- for which there were no answers, and yet we still look for them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's what you saying [indecipherable] saying that's how I feel, you know?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: If they send me the check, yes I take the money, because automatic it's coming to my account, so I take it, you know. But from a human point of view, from my personal point of view, I wonder how I would feel if I would be in that situation. His -- they didn't cause it. It was the grandfather, or the grand-grandfather. And to -- to analyze what reasons that person had 50 years ago -- you only can [indecipherable] to almighty God.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Let's talk a little bit about Georgine, if we can.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I told you that she was there, right here, where we are.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What I mean is, just give me the outlines of what happened to her, when you were split apart. She was --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Sweetheart, she went through Auschwitz.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And anybody who went through Auschwitz, and saw that misery, and had a heart, and if sh -- if u-- she was lucky that she didn't have to work, although when they came here, she did. Remember, she had a British passport, so she was working for the British consulate on Rockefeller Center.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: How long, I can't -- I don't remember, short while, then she got another job. But that's not the issue. So she was lucky that she could have stayed home. She stayed home when she became pregnant. Well, that was another reason why she had all that surgery, because they were saying, if you treat it with nuclear energy, she will become sterile. And as a young woman, you know, you didn't like that. So she had the surgery rather than the --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right. <span class="page-break" number="113"></span> ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion Interview with Frank Hyde m May 4, 2013</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- treatment, and eventually, just like I said, we were working about two years or so, and she became pregnant. We had -- she had a vacation, I had a vacation, and was like summertime, she quit her job. Well, then, you know how it takes, it takes a few months to get to that place. So she was very happy, she was a hundred percent mother. And having seen all these children perish in Auschwitz, she devoted her life to children. Truth is the truth. So she went when John was six, kindergarten, or whatever that system is here. She started to be on the school board. Not as a teacher, she was never a teacher. And through her persistence, integrity, or interest, whatever, she was on the school board for 32 years.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Wow.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So here, in this country, they s -- in the local school board here, there's a room dedicated to Georgine's 32 years of being on the school board, giving service to the children. Now, if we would have time, she has literally hundreds of these things, what were -- now we have this.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So we have all kinds of wooden plaques, testimonials, we had it here hanging.</p><p>Well, you know, they changed.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't blame them. This is [indecipherable]. They had here hanging, honorary doctorate. She has a couple of honorary doctorates. What I'm telling you, like I just told you, I am not a person who will make things bigger than they are --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- this is the truth. Where it is now, I don't know. Elise has a tendency to change things. Which is fine, I'm -- she's a very hardworking person, and I told you, I like all three of them. What happened to it, I don't know, it was always hanging here. So maybe they put it inside, or something, I don't know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Was a proclamation of one university, honorary doctorate in, like they called letters, or something? Like writing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you -- did you talk with one another about what you both went through, a lot?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But you know, here's another thing that's unusual. You got married, so that you wouldn't be called up for the army. Everybody --</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You both survive, you come back, and then you spend a lifetime together. That's unusual.
