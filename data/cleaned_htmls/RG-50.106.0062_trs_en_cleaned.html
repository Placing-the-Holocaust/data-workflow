My father had a moderate sized department store in Budapest. He had truly no any financial problems. I went to the Jewish elementary school, and basically in 1939 I was a nice supposed to go to starting my gymnasium, which is high school, in Hungary and when the classes started. And numerous classes means that we have a relatively small percentage of Jewish students that are admitted to the high schools. I believe it was 4 percent of the total of student population. I'm really not sure about the percentage. But, yes, in May, I was between those fortunate ones that were admitted to high school and four of us four Jew in class of about 50 started our high school years. The school which I went to, it happened to be a rather revisionist national and rather anti Semitic school. And as far as discrimination, certainly it was, but nevertheless, it was tolerated. They didn't have any, shall I say, outstanding incidence during the years up to 1944.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can you tell me your parents" names.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My father's name is Anton, and my mother is Barbara.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You said that there were incidents that were tolerable, anti Semitic incidents that were tolerable. Can you be more specific. What kinds of things did you yourself experience or did you yourself see?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We were almost constantly in the central of of, I should say, remarks and anti Semitic passions. But those were kind of rather intelligently, if that is the right expression, and no physical violence, maybe once or twice through the years that I've The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

And this did not come from the faculty. It's mostly of peer</p><p> pressure and anti Semitic peer pressure. But those incidents become a part of our life. So,</p><p> as a matter of fact, we barely noticed them after a while.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you come from a religious family?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. No. We have always been on the on the reform, quote, unquote, side. They</p><p> called us the Yom Kippur Jews, that my parents and myself went to at the Beit Knesset,</p><p> maybe twice a year. Nevertheless, I had a very fabulous and big style bar mitzvah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can you tell me about it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, it was inthe in the great Beit Knesset of this and a very large crowd, I would</p><p> say. And of course, I knew the Sidra, and there were no any hitches. And</p><p> subsequently, it was a rather large reception. And as a matter of fact, it was in 1942.</p><p> And I had no idea that was practically the same time that the Russia ghetto, but sometime</p><p> after. It was in Pesach 1942. And as a matter of fact, that it was after the Nazi</p><p> conference, andthe _ was already a forced thing. They didn't know at least we did</p><p> not realize it. So our life was relatively not even not even not relatively, but fine,</p><p> financially, as well as any other area, even socially. Obviously, our social attachment</p><p> was almost exclusively Jewish.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So the only traditional observances that you have mentioned that you observed were</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> the bar mitzvah and being a Yom Kippur Jew. Did you have a kosher home?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, we did not.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you observe any of the other holidays?</p></p></dialogue>

And we</p><p> were rather assimilated Hungarian Jews. But I have to emphasize, despite the fact that we</p><p> were assimilated, we were Jews. It was unquestioned and had never been a question.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You said your family was not very religious but they sent you to a Jewish school,</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> religious school. Did they ever explain to you why they did that?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, it's probably fact of convenience. It was close, and there is children that they</p><p> went to kindergarten together with at the same school. And I'm sure that my parents were</p><p> aware of the importance to have some kind of Jewish tradition put in my head at the time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you have any idea of how large the Jewish population was in your town?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Of course. That is not difficult. Budapest, at that time, I believe, the population was</p><p> about a million; and the Jewish population estimated at the time, if I'm not mistaken, 120</p><p> or 130,000. That's the capital of Hungary and obviously in the largest city in the country.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When you were growing up, what language or languages did you speak in your home?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, we spoke at home exclusively Hungarian. My parents speak German, and very</p><p> little of it. And then during high school, I learned English, but my parents did not.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When you were growing up, what did you do for fun when you were not in school?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, as a -- what every young child does, we had a gang of mostly Jewish friends and</p><p> played around and played around, obviously, and went to movies and sport activities.</p><p> We belonged to the a Jewish athletic club. So we did gymnastics. We went swimming</p><p> and some ski, as well as some ice skating in the winter time. That is nothing the</p><p> exception. That was the exactly the same thing that a middle-class Jewish kid does in The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

Oh, I had just to emphasize, no one in the family spoke Yiddish. I think it's an</p><p> important point. As a matter of fact, my grandparents did not speak Yiddish. They spoke</p><p> German fluently, but none of them spoke Yiddish.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did your family have a long history in Budapest?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, my recollection, my maternal grandfather was born in a small town close to the</p><p> Czech Hungarian border, and my other my other grandfather was born in Moravia.</p><p> And subsequently, the family then moved to began to a town which was close to the</p><p> Czech Hungarian border. It's called Komarom, which is not far from from Bratislava.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You were telling me that you were having your bar mitzvah and you were doing all</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> these things like going to movies and sports. And you had no idea what was going on</p><p> with Jewish communities in other parts of Europe?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, we were an assimilated Jewish family. I put it very very bluntly. We I</p><p> suppose we did. Obviously the Jewish laws which _ the anti Jewish laws which started</p><p> up in Hungary and we were (?absolutely?) and Italy, and up to that with regard to the</p><p> state of the war and however, the obviously, the extent that horrendous happenings</p><p> which were not far from us, we did not really realize, except that in the 1940s and 1941,</p><p> 1942, obviously, first of all, our mere population had gone for paramilitary duties,</p><p> including, obviously, my father and all the family. And they were taken most of the time</p><p> to the Russian front. And the atrocities regarding the Jewish paramilitary personnel</p><p> ____+ every day. And the parents, the friends, the friends of friends, everybody</p><p> between the ages of 18 to at least at that time, I believe, 48, we havea in the</p><p> paramilitary units. And the Hungarian anti Semitism was flourishing. So it was clear to The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

But as far as what's going on,</p><p> the first realization through the what's happening was when the non Hungarian citizen</p><p> Jews were deported tocome in --_--_--swhich was__"[ believe it was in'41, in [| think it</p><p> was in the winter of 1941. And a few who survived and came back at all had</p><p> unbelievable stories which was very difficult to realize for us that they are true and they</p><p> are really reliable information because our life was totally different and we didn't feel this</p><p> tremendous pressure. We did feel pressure, but but as individuals, they let they let us</p><p> at that time to be. It is true that the Hungarian the Jewish Hungarian professionals are</p><p> slowly lose their jobs in 1941. There is a second Jewish law came out, said the practicing</p><p> professionals lost their licenses, and there was a lot of restrictions. But as far as personal</p><p> dangers, so to speak, it was far from us. Ina sense, it was for these delusions, and they</p><p> said to us that's what's happening across the border. It cannot happen in Hungary. After</p><p> all, we are Hungarian Jews and Hungarians and that that maybe can happen on the east</p><p> but not in a cultured country like Hungary and the usual hog wash that everyone is</p><p> basically at least in Hungarian assimilated Jews felt.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you recall any talk among the adults that you were rather young among the</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> adults about what was writing and saying and doing vis a vis the Jews?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But of course. That's that's obvious. Again, you see, you have to at that time despite</p><p> obviously it was clear to us and it was priority of the German not I wouldn't say general</p><p> journalistic activity because it's a matter of fact that in the 1940 and 1941 it was still</p><p> sporadic and not totally centrally organized. But we looked at itina ina _ througha</p><p> pink eyeglasses, that we are out of it, that we cannot itis not the same. Itis it is not The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

So we were aware of the fact and knew very well, and the the general policy lines were very clear of the Nazi party and Hitler and but but we felt that maybe in a bit we are somehow immune from this. And of course it's was kind ofa of a trying to, so to speak, stay away from the reality. But it was very difficult later on, obviously, when you find that you your relatives, your father, your friends, in the in the paramilitary and it's and died from typhus or from from tremendous atrocities from the Hungarians and Army personnel. Obviously we were aware of the fact. But still the the everyday bourgeois life, so to speak, it's on the we somehow -- | think that was very difficult to the Hungarian Jews that tried to kind of of separate themselves from the reality. It's really delusional. That that was the protection. That was the unseen defense mechanisms, so to speak.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you personally have any contact with anybody who had left had fled from Nazi occupied territory or from Germany itself?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not until 1943. 1943 [hada friend that they were foreign, not Hungarian citizens, and they were __ and they succeeded to come back to parents of massacre and other family and they came back and back but the first time that that personally I heard that such things could happen. But it was an isolated incident. Really. Subsequently, after that as far as we discussed this problem, she said that it's probably there is a traumatic posttraumatic shock syndrome, the boy doesn't know what the hell he's talking about.</p><p>Again, they tried I mean, it's kind of a natural denial type of mannerism, I suppose.</p><p>The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell me a little about what your days were like in the early "40s. What was the typical</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> day for you in "41 and "42? How did things start to change?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not much, really. Not much. "40,"41,"42,asI said I had my bar mitzvah in 1942.</p><p> A big tzimmes, everybody happy, a full presence. And my problems were that in</p><p> mathematics I got a B instead of an A and that we didn't reach our group in the sport</p><p> arena didn't do well and there are, you know, no more American films. Obviously, that</p><p> was afact a fact of life. The German, Italian films were shed, and I mean that was a</p><p> fact, even naive, and we lived all of us normal student and teenager life.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When did you start you yourself start noticing that things were changing?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: As I said, in 1943 and in the end of 1942 and "43, then they the close friends and the</p><p> family started getting involved, and I don't know. I don't want to sound naive. But that</p><p> that's the way that I recollect my my memory. In any event,in19 1942 and 1943, the</p><p> tension began getting high. Andthe and the awareness that was living has become</p><p> more and more obvious for us. Not talking about, obviously, reading the papers and the</p><p> German victories and the unstoppable Reich. It was before Stalingrad, obviously, and</p><p> before North Africa and Roma, and so forth. So the whole thing started a lot to be</p><p> hopeless as faras as a Jewish individual that's in the axis of thes Nazi Hungary.</p><p> But despite that, still with that, life went on, and no major economic hardships yet. My</p><p> father was inthe inthe that's that's called the work units, but the shop went on, and</p><p> my life my mother sorry my mother took care of the things, and we still had hope The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

So the major despite the awareness includes the awareness that everyday life and everyday problems are, no question, the major considerations.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So when you look back, when was the moment that you began to realize that you were in very serious danger?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was a Saturday, and the and myself and my very close friends at school met and walked around the major railway station in Budapest. That was the northern railway station. And we saw the first German soldier. That was a somewhat rainy day. I recollect that the guys there at the wore a long, black rain coat, and they had a kind of plaque that on their neck, and it turned to be the military German military police.</p><p>And that was the day that the Germans had invaded Hungary. And when we stood by and we looked at this soldiers of police military police persons that are asking papers for everybody is coming out from the railway station and putting people aside in groups, that was really the first moment that it's it's hit home, that we are in real trouble.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What were some of the things that happened next?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, we got home. And my father was away, of course, in the in the we called it "munkaszolgalat" in Hungarian, which is basically forced-labor unit. And my mother said, "So what do you say? Did you see them?" And he said, "Of course I did see them." "So?" "So same thing will happen here that we hear about it in other countries where the Nazis are." Okay. The things started to escalate very rapidly because the Germans came in in the 19 of March. And in the beginning of April I believe it was mid April, the 20th of April we already woke up with a yellow star in our chest. Okay? That was basically the first decision of the new Hungarian government, that all the Jews have to The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

Still, the schools were open. So we went to the school with the yellow star on us. But you know what? I truly recall that, despite of the heavy anti Semitic atmosphere in the school, nobody said a word, not not just as though nothing happened. I don't know why. Maybe it was some kind ofa a how should I say? The consciousness? I really don't know what was the reason, but we didn't feel that this yellow staris makes any difference in the relationship. The relationship wasn't good.</p><p>I'm not saying. But certainly it did not influence. So that was the that was the truly for a teenager the first true and the fact thatthe --sesthat the futureis +.</p><p>About I think about three or four weeks later, there were massive air bombardment in Budapest, and many buildings were destroyed. And that was the second thing that I recall that the government they required the Jewish apartments to be evacuated for the casualties, as a matter of fact, those Christians whose homes was destroyed. So about 2,000 families were kicked out very swiftly from their home. That was the first one. And subsequently I believe it was in May _ that the law came that Jews has to be _ has to move to certain houses. There is a clear distinction with the marked houses. And then, obviously, our life totally crumbled because we had a couple of hours to evacuate our home, which was just I mean, you know, it's very traumatic, obviously, not only for a teenager, but the whole family. So we practically left almost everything in and a couple of other families which house become a Jewish house were still outside. That happened in May. In the meantime, obviously, all the Jewish government employees were kicked out. All the professionals, they lost their licenses. And nevertheless, still, I believe until June, the stores the Jews" stores were not nationalized. That was the time. I'm not sure The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

And then started, shall I say, the news come in that there are ghettos in the country, especially in the northeast part at the beginning as it every day inthe the new Jewish laws were printed, placards, and of course in newspapers and so forth. And the deportations started. And we were aware of the deportations, obviously.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When you said new Jewish laws were being you know, were coming out, can you be specific. Can you give me a few examples of some of these laws that started to come out?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Sure. That's no different. Professional restrictions, subsequently food restrictions, subsequently housing restrictions. Then some forced labor, especially for women and and male. So those are they were basically escalating the restrictions which had become more and more and more severe, and you're and your life as an individual was totally and entirely interrupted from every point of view, and on the top of it obviously that you didn't feel yet but you you personally, but you started to notice the problematic the the territories in Hungaria, the countryside, there are ghettos formed. And the ghettos started to be deported, although they had no idea, as far as I know, not only myself but my family, about Auschwitz, or about the (?fenishtislagers?). We did not know. But certainly we did know that these people were taken away as if a packaged or together and all the belongings. They were rough, and they were violent, and they were in horrible condition. These people were taken away to the east. That's what we know. But we did know. Andsoa_ the tension grew constantly, although, again, we still hoped, at least, or we did not realize or we did not want to realize that the standard of our life is in danger as well.</p><p>The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

I was taken with we've been we've been in Jewish</p><p> juvenile units. And that was kind of also kind of a paramilitary business. It's not</p><p> paramilitary. Sorry. It was nothing to do with military. Forced-labor plant for business.</p><p> So it we were all brought up to collectively go toa a brick factory to work. I think it</p><p> was in June. But I really don't remember exactly. I think it was end of May, beginning</p><p> of June. And we were takenin__--justa_ it'sbasically the _-- the Danube, and it's</p><p> an old part of outskirts of the city area and in a big factory. And we worked there, my</p><p> schoolmates. We were basically together, and we we it was a 24 hour business. We</p><p> didn't get home at all. So we stayed there around the clock.

We had to covers, and that's it. That was the situation of that. As far as the the recorded that the houses with the yellow star, it's depends. There have been families together, and in the most of them, the living conditions were not not atrocious. It was crowded, obviously, and cramped. But it was really what I mean is you left behind your belongings, your life achievements, everything else. It was obviously very difficult, mostly emotionally, but physically it wasn't too bad. A family had one room instead of four or five, six, or seven. And they shared facilities, obviously. But in most instances and I'm talking about people that I know and they were middle class people they had enough. The food was still although scarce, but certainly didn't it wasn't hunger. There were restricted hours that you can get out and buy food on your food cards, obviously, which provided you I don't remember as far as the calories or I think no. I don't want to think because I don't know, really, if it was 1,200 or 1,500. I have no idea. I really don't remember the details.</p><p>But nevertheless, we had enough. It happened to be that we moved into a friend's house that had a large grocery chain. So, I mean, there was no no problem as far as we are concerned. And a crowded conditions but _ but livable at that time for us. So I can't talk about really how the population, Jewish population at large. Probably they were but I I believe the same thing happened with my vast family. Until they were in the in the yellow star houses, they were pretty well off. They were and in a Jewish community and you know how it is. I think one helps the other, especially in hard times. It was not too bad.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What's the next thing you do remember?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, the next thing which I do remember, very vividly remember, it was the 15th of October. That's what happened. On the 14th of October, there was a proclamation in Hungarian radio in which the governor, Horthy, declared that that Hungary is jumping out of the war. So that was the tremendous jubilation, obviously. We were still on the same Jewish yellow star house that I already described. Though we were exceedingly happy that, my goodness, that's the end of the story, after all. The Russians got in the Hungarian border. They are progressing beautifully. And this is really now that half after Romania Romania wanted to jump out of the war and Italy, obviously. So that was in 1990 in 1944, October. So we thought that maybe we _ we will be able to salvage ourselves in the meantime. The the they through the Swedish embassy, we knew that the SS left the country, basically. There was special SS dealing with Jewish things. So we thought that's the end of the story. And then on the 15th, which there was next morning, we look out in the window, and we saw the trucks for this the Hungarian Nazis with the Arrow Cross part in the automobiles with full regalia and the German | don't really know the realm of the SS, but I know that the presence become very heavy in the area that we lived. And that that was the turning point, obviously, which, as you know, for the Budapest Jews, because the Hungarian Jews _ the rest of the Hungarian Jews crossed the 700,000 already was killed in Auschwitz. But still at that time we didn't still, at that time we didn't know really about about Auschwitz whatsoever. No. We The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

But truly</p><p> so that was in in October. And then the all the women and the all the males were</p><p> ordered to one of the one of the large assembly places. And they then the march</p><p> started. As you know, the fact being that there were no possibility already to deport from</p><p> the from the capital. The fact is that the Russians already closed over all the roads to</p><p> Auschwitz. So it was after October, there was no way that the deportation could be. The</p><p> the Budapest Jews deportation couldn't be done because the roads are already fortunately</p><p> not the Red Army that occupied them already. So that time I about two weeks later, a</p><p> proclamation from the from the Arrow Cross party and the Parliament came that you</p><p> have to move in the ghetto. They established a ghetto. I believe it was in in the first</p><p> week of November, if I am not mistaken. But, nevertheless, we were very, very fortunate</p><p> because we moved into international ghetto, which is basically the protected houses. We</p><p> had Schutz Passes from the from the Swedish government, the fact being that probably</p><p> decent connections I would think that, because as a matter of fact, my wife and uncle is in</p><p> Stockholm, but I don't know how much would that affect us, because I didn't know my</p><p> wife at the time. She was only ten years old. So anyway, at I made it too complicated.</p><p> They had Schutz Passes. As areason as a result of the Schutz Passes, we may have</p><p> been protected in the house, the Swedish house, which was _ they were around the city.</p><p> There were a couple of houses. I believe there were around eight or ten center houses</p><p> where the Swedish Schutz Pass bearers could move in. And I mean, you have half a</p><p> room, but nevertheless, you had some kind of protection. So my father was at the time in</p><p> in the forced arm forced camp in Szolnok, which is about, I would say, 80 miles from The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

And somehow, through the grapevine, we heard that they are going to transfer them through, and supposed to taking them to Germany. So I, being the head of the _ the family at that time, obviously. Sol I took off my yellow star, and I went out to the railway station that generally the transport is going through. I think it was about three or four days after my first visit there, indeed, they _ the train arrived. I didn't know at that time that my father was on this train or not. But suddenly, Wallenberg appeared, his people at least three other people. And suddenly, I saw my father coming out of the railway station. And said, "What's going on?" Said, "Well, had Schutz Pass, and they let me off the train." So we, without any major incidents, were protected in the Swedish house. All right. The things were more or less, besides the fact that obviously tension was tremendous and the ghetto had horrible problems, the __--+ the hunger or the or the only three months was the ghetto. But still, over 120 or 130,000 people were pushed in less than a square mile to a square area. The situation was horrible. And we were much better off because we lived in a protected house, and we had a half a room for ourselves, and water was running. And as a matter of fact, the telephone was working still in the building. And I do remember very, very, very clearly that it was Christmas morning that the first Russian show arrived to our neighborhood. That was a tremendous turn. Budapest was already surrounded. And they started, basically, the last stage of the of the Red Army. The front moved closer and closer and closer. And as the front moved closer and closer and closer, the the Arrow Cross people become more and more wide, and unbelievable atrocities happened. And as a matter of fact, one of the Swedish houses it was, I believe, in December that tenants were taken out to the Danube, and they were The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

So we knew that,</p><p> of course, we were fine. Through the consulate = +. So we arrived on the 28th of</p><p> December. On the 28th of December, suddenly broke the door of the house, and the</p><p> Arrow Cross appeared, and everybody down from the apartments. And and it was the</p><p> very similar procedure that happened in the other houses which were taken and executed.</p><p> Okay? And it happened to be that my uncle was a lawyer, and as a lawyer, he had a big</p><p> mouth, and the big mouth he was staying the responsible person for the whole bloody</p><p> house. He was the _ he was the kind of supervisor of the house, if you want to. So this</p><p> story, by the way, is written down very well in one of Wallenberg's book. It's by name,</p><p> and it's it's very well documented. So I am just now quoting, as a matter of fact, from</p><p> the book, telling of what happened. Basically what happened was there was a one</p><p> working telephone, and my dear uncle called the consulate, which was in a different part</p><p> of the city. And for some unbelievable luck, Wallenberg just happened to be in the</p><p> consulate in this ina certain location. So we went down to the -- it's I'm not sure that</p><p> you know how is the major European houses. They have a central kind ofa a_ they</p><p> have a square sorry.

I really cannot give you any detailed information because I simply don't know. They were they were like us. All of us for some reason or another or because they did have some relatives in Sweden and those who were just randomly selected and happened to have a Schutz Pass. They were there. Nothing exceptional, really simple, mostly middle class Jewish families. So making the long story short, the Arrow Cross gone.

I didn't my mother met him much more because of her her volunteer work on the onthe it's not the consulate. It was physically a makeshift office that that they are manufactured the Schutz Passes. And that's _ that's it. And Wallenberg was always on the road and always moving, and death march, and just a historic fact that I don't have to tell you. It's he pulled out the people from the death marches, supplied food as much as possible.

They got them in the hands and brought them up, and we found in between them a nice Jewish major. And he spoke Yiddish. I didn't. But there were a good many people in the buildings spoke Yiddish.

It's it it's just a by coincidence</p><p> that you stayed alive and at least in the last four months of the war. So we looked</p><p> everything in an optimistic eye, truly. And, hell, who cares?

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Very soon. Very soon.

But about a week after we'd been liberated, we already started to hear</p><p> about Auschwitz and Treblinka and Belzec, Majdanek, but mostly Auschwitz, and the</p><p> reason being that the Hungarian Jews went to Auschwitz. Okay? So if you just think a</p><p> minute and you say that the first trains left Hungary to Auschwitz in May the 15th, the</p><p> last trains before Horthy stopped deportation and July the 10th, those are already the last</p><p> two trains to take one. Roughly 750,000 Hungarian Jews were exterminated. The fact is</p><p> that there were no selection for the Hungarian Jews back then. So it's it's such an</p><p> incredible thing thatIam I it'shardto hard to believe thatlam I have difficulties</p><p> really to digest it today, 50 years later, about that time. It's incredible. And then,</p><p> obviously, that, you know, the press started up very soon, because the other part of</p><p> Hungary was already liberated. So the press is moved with the Red Army until got the</p><p> information.
