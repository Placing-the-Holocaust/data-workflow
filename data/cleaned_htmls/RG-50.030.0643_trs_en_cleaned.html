<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Okay. Well, I was born on August 23", 1920, which my grandson says I was always old. As far as he's concerned, I was always old. And I was born in Frankfurt; both my parents were from Frankfurt. My mother was Jewish, my father was not. My father comes from an old farming family.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was his name?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And all his ancestors were dairy farmers, including my grandparents, whom I did not know; I did not know his parents. My mother, on the other hand, came from a banking family, and her maiden name was Hahn, h-a-h-n. And my great-grandfather, I think it was, [indecipherable] is hanging there on the wall, established a banking house. Of</p><p><span class="page-break" number="0"></span> Interview with Judith Heimann :</p><p> November 21, 2011</p><p> course, like all Jews, they originally lived in the ghetto in Frankfurt, and they were</p><p> moneychangers, I guess. That's, you know, how most of them started. And then, I think</p><p> my grandfather's grandfather -- that's my grandfather, and that's my great-grandfather.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Those two pictures up there --</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And on my mother's side. And he started a bank, which was called L.A. Hahn. And</p><p> all their initials were L.A. And it later became a public -- publicly traded bank which was</p><p> called Deutsche Effecten-und Wechselbank.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Deutsche Effecten-und Wechselbank?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. And, in fact, the house is still standing and it's a historic -- has a historic</p><p> designation of the bank, but --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So the ba -- the bank's building and facility?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, the bank's building. It's really just the outside, because the rest was destroyed</p><p> during the war, but the outside is still standing. So anyway, they had a bank. And of</p><p> course you may know that in Frankfurt there were lots of mixed marriages.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, I wanted to ask you about that, you know, how was it that your parents even</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> met? What brought the -- brought their worlds together?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I really just don't know, but -- but my father was -- my grandparents ha -- on my</p><p> father's side had three boys, and my father was the youngest.

And he is the only one who went to university, and he had a law -- he got a law degree. And I think he was very society minded. And he --I-- I'll show you later upstairs, I have a -- an old program from something at the [indecipherable] opera, where he danced with some lady. And I have a feeling that that's how they met, because he was really very interested in getting up there somehow. He was also a champion tennis player. He was German master in 1910, which was a different tennis game from what it is now, but nevertheless.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It's still something, it's an achievement, you know, in competition with others in your area.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, yeah, I -- I have all the trophies upstairs. And he also played the piano very well, and he used to accompany singers or play in small trios. So I'm --I am sure that's how they met somehow, in -- in a dance, or whatever.</p></p></dialogue>

He was one of the most tactful people I've ever known, and really was charming. I mean, everybody just loved him. And he -- he just -- he ended up being a banker, because he finally took over my grandparents bank. But he -- he should have been a diplomat. He -- he was not very strict, but you know, I -- I grew up at a time that my parents weren't home that much, and I had a-- a wonderful -- I don't This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And so then they -- you know, my father, I remember, he is -- at the time I had allergic eczema, which of course, when I was a child they didn't know it was allergy. And I remember my father always at night bandaging my arms, so that I wouldn't scratch, you know. But you know, I don't really know if it was so often. It just -- your memory just plays tricks on you. Anyway, it was -- it was very nice. I grew up -- well, my family, I guess they had a lot of money, but I didn't really know that, you know? I -- it never occurred to me that I lived different from a lot of other people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, what do you remember about your home; both as a physical structure, and about the kind of life that you and your f-- your parents and your sister; and whoever else was there, the -- the young girl who was part of your household; what was that like? So let's talk about all of it. Describe it a bit.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, we lived -- and later when we've finished I'll show you the pictures, because I have pict -- pictures on the wall of -- of my --I grew up in what used to be my grandparents dairy farm.</p></p></dialogue>

And it was a regular farm in a U-shape, with the main house on one side, and then what used to be the barns in a U-shape around it. In the middle was a -- a well. And of course we didn't have any animals any more -- I mean, we had dogs, but -- and chickens, but not the cows and stuff. So we used the barns mainly for garages.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: For what?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: For garage.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And also for our bicycles and -- and tools and stuff.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did it still look like a farm, or did it look like a villa in the outskirts of town?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, it looked like a farm. And it [indecipherable] three acres. And it actually, when I grew up, was no longer on the outskirts of -- of town, it was in town.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see, in Frankfurt itself.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes. So it -- you know, the streetcar was a half a block away. So it -- then I took the streetcar to go to wo -- to go to school. So it -- it was really in the middle of town. And the one thing I really regret, it -- it has been razed now, and I regret that because if historic preservation had come into life sooner, that thing would have stayed, because it's very unusual to have a farm in the middle of --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Of course.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- of town.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And it had a -- a gate in the front, which usually was open because we had cars, but you could close the gate, and then it had a driveway, long driveway, which led you into the courtyard. And next door was a boys" school, which was kind of nice when I grew up.</p><p>But it was really just beautiful, and we had a large, just garden for -- to enjoy, and then we had a lot of vegetables, and we had chickens. A-And -- and we did have a lot of help. I-I think we probably had three maids, and -- and there was, from the -- across the courtyard from the main house, there was th -- at the end of the last barn there was another little house, and the -- I don't know what the guy's name, it was sort of a -- like a -- a super in This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah. And -- and then we had a gardener who lived in the same place upstairs, and I -- I think we had three maids and a cook, but I can't -- yeah, I think we had three maids and a cook. So I sometimes wonder what my mother did all day, but --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Well, tell me a little bit about her. If I asked you about what your father's personality was like, what was hers like?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My mother enjoyed ill health.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh gosh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, she -- she was -- I'm sure she had some ill health, but if she -- if she did, I know, had a stomach operation early in her marriage. I have a feeling it all -- it had to do with nerves too, you know? And then she, in 1929 she had a major operation, I -- I don't know if it was a hysterectomy, or something like that. And what is very unfortunate, she had a surgeon who was addicted to morphine, and he got her addicted.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh dear.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And she was addicted the rest of her life.</p></p></dialogue>

I knew it mainly through other people, who told me about it. She was, you know, she had -- of course had not gone to college, but she was pretty smart, and she had a lot of common sense. And she was very -- she had a lot of empathy. And I'l tell you a little story, during the depression, you know, in -- starting in 1930, I guess, when there was so much poverty in Germany, she started a soup kitchen at our house.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Wow.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And it's one of my most vivid memories. We -- the kitchen door was on the side, and the kitchen door had -- had sort of a window you could raise up to the outside. And we would have, every day, about 20 people who came. After a while, we started giving out little slips to people, to say which day they could come, and -- with their name. And I know I used to write those slips, which is why I remember it so well. And then they would come starting at noon, and our cook would have a big soup, you know, something substantial, and bread. And we had benches in the courtyard. And if it was raining, we put them in the -- one of the barns. And then the people would eat their lun-lunch, or main meal, I guess. In fact, we had one couple that found each other and got married. And then on Christmas, she always had everybody come, and she -- they got -- the men got shaving cream and stuff like that, and the women got some other stuff. He -- they -- they all got the little bag with goodies. So she really, I mean, and that was entirely my mother's make -- doing.</p></p></dialogue>

But, of course, the addiction was dreadful, because you know, a-an addiction to morphine is the same as -- as a heroin addiction, or any other. It's unpredictable. The mood can be -- one day you think, oh, she's wonderful, and then you talk a lot, and then the next day she's gone again, you know. And -- and she did go into rehab twice in Germany, and then it was better for a while, but it never lasted. And then when she came to this country -- you know, I don't know where she got her morphine. That's sometimes the curse of having money. And -- but a -- it was the same in -- in Tucson, where she lived, I mean, she -- and in the end, it wa -- was just awful. But you know, tha-that is -- that was very sad, really.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. And hard for children.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But, you know, it -- the one thing I-- I -- I have told this to my kids from the day they were born, in order to make sure that they stayed away from all drugs, because I told them how horrible this is.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, the price that people pay. The price that the family pays, the price that the person pays.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: It-- it's -- it's -- it's really very sad. But, you know -- and -- and I know -- I mean, we all know it was -- it was her surgeon who got her addicted, and he was addicted him -- a lot of doctors are addicted, I think.</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Did they -- did they enjoy each other's company?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, they did. And -- and, as I think I want to -- I mean, they got divorced in 38. I think it had na -- it had absolutely nothing to do with the fact that my mother was Jewish, and my father wasn't. My sister and I saw that divorce coming for years. Which doesn't mean they weren't friendly. They were very friendly, they always talked to each other and -- and -- but, you know, I -- it's very hard to look at your parents and think about sex.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's true.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But I think it was very -- they were incompatible. That's what I think, you know, and I think that my father wasn't that interested in it, and my mother was more interested in it, and do I think that was the basis for the divorce. Because she got married again, but -- to the guy that she'd been going with for years, anyway.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And what did they say?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And my grandmother said, three guesses.

They -- they were -- Albert Hahn also was a professor at the university in Frankfurt, but I mean, his main job was at the bank. And then, of course, in "33, it all became more difficult. My mother's sister's husband was also at the bank, but he was not very competent. Was a nice guy, but not very competent. And my father at that point, was working at a different bank that belonged to my grandmother's brother. And then, in deg34 or so, I think, they asked my father to leave that bank and come to the Deutsche Effecten Wechselbank. But of course, all of that, 1 mean nu -- and -- and my grandfather left, and the nephew left. But of course, it still was a bank with a lot of Jewish connections.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And the -- the se --- many -- much of the shares were held by the family. When my grandmother had a -- a cousin -- I -- I'm never quite sure what the relationship is, but it's sort of a cousin, or a nephew, or whatever, who had been the black sheep in the family, and had been exiled by the family to South Africa, where fortunately, he went into diamond mines.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, I tell you, I grew up, of course, since -- since we seemed to be more on my father's religion, I went to confirmation class, I was confirmed in the German Reform church. And then I married my husband. And he didn't want to have anything to do with religion, period, because he said he can't believe that any God would allow what happened, you know. So, he said, you do whatever you want to do. So since I grew up that way, I had both my kids baptized, which is more than my son has done, or -- and it didn't mean anything to me, it was -- I did it more to please my father, because at that point he and my sister were very engaged in that church. And so | had them both baptized -- they both went to -- I joined briefly the Westmoreland Congregational Church here, because I was looking for a church that wasn't too churchy. And so that was fine, and the kids went there for -- for Sunday school, til they were about nine or 10, and then they said we -- all we do is draw pictures. And they both went to [indecipherable] Friends, which of course, the Quaker school. Somehow I tend more to Jewish stuff now. It's not that I This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: 1933.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And so what do you remember about that time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, that was a very unfortunate choice that my parents made, I -- 1 -- I mentioned earlier that my mother was not well.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And in early "33, she had a nervous breakdown, which I think was related to Hitler's taking o -- my mother is one of the very few people that I know, who had read "Mein Kampf," and knew what was coming. And so I think she had a nervous breakdown, and therefore didn't really think about my school. I mean, I do -- I don't blame her, you know, when you're sick, you're sick. So anyway, they sent me to public school, and of course in 1933, you shouldn't send a half-Jew to public school who -- when you have a private school where you've been.</p></p></dialogue>

But in any case, they sent me --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Do you think they just weren't thinking?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I think nobody thought much, because I think it was a horrible time. A-And you know, you change schools in Germany, or you didn't; in any case, I don't know what it's like now; on Easter, after Easter, that's when the new year starts. And that was pretty soon after Hitler took over, and I think they just never thought. In any case, I went to that school, and there was one a -- one more half-Jewish girl in the class, and one girl who was a full Jew, and the rest were not. The other half-Jewish girl, unfortunately her last name was Solomon, which of course, a much more Jewish name than Bartmann was. And we had a classroom teacher who was really a Nazi. And some of the other teachers were too, and of course, some of the girls were. And it was not always pleasant. There -- I --I did have two or three friends, or four sa -- more even. In fact, one of my high school friends is still alive, like I am. She lives in Frankfurt, and my niece takes care of her, because she never married, and she's alone, and so my niece takes care of her. But -- and she was my friend. PII tell you about her in a minute, because she is also an interesting case.

And the more he did this, the worse I got in school. And a -- one semester he was not there, and I got very good grades from some other teacher. So, I mean, I -- I think a lot had to do with that. In any case, I went there for three years, and I really -- I mean, I wasn't unhappy, but it was just not a good experience. It -- it was stupid.</p></p></dialogue>

Now, the girl who was a full Jew was not allowed to go.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>And the other one who wa -- whose name was Solomon, they debated for a long time whether she could go.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: That was not in school, I didn't notice that so much. But somehow it was -- it was very unfortunate.

And I ha --I didn't know this til almost the end of the school year -- of course, that was the time nobody asked you if you want to do this, you were just simply told, that's what you're doing. And so I said to that classroom teacher, I said, I'm leaving. Whereupon he said to me, if you had told me sooner, I would have given you the grades you really deserve, but I didn't know you weren't coming back. Which was very interesting, you know.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Is that when she left the home?</p></p></dialogue>

And my sister had gone to boarding school, so I was home alone with my father, who was very lenient, and I did what I wanted to do. Not homework for sure, but -- but everything else. I just had a good time. And then I went to England to this boarding school, where every minute of the day is programmed.</p></p></dialogue>

You have to take everything you have to have, with you. Well, I hated the whole place, and I was there for one year. Nobody had asked me if I wanted to go, but I went. And then, after the year, they decided I would go to Switzerland to learn French. Now there, I will say, they gave me a choice of two different schools, which I went, inspected with my father.

So I chose the little school, where you had a bathroom where you could lock the door. So I went there, and there were only about 40 of us, maybe 35 kids. I really enjoyed that. It was very nice, I was very good in French, which I don't remember at all any more, but it was -- it was really very nice, and there were many girls from England, probably about 10 or 11 girls from London, and there were three Americans -- no, there were four Americans. And then the rest was different. One girl was from Haifa, she was an Arab, and there were some Italians and a couple of Swiss. It was interesting -- and that's a sideline that I knew there was a big kerfuffle at the beginning, in the American room -- they -- they stupidly, they -- there was one other German girl, and I don't know why they would put us together in a room with -- with a Greek girl and an Italian girl, and they put all four American girls into one room.</p><p>And I knew there was a big kerfuffle, but I never understood -- I mean, we just didn't know. And it was only after I was in this country for a while, and looked at the pictures that I realized that one of the girls was black. Very light black, but she was black. And I'm sure that's what the kerfuffle was all about. She was from San Francisco, her name was Georgia Naifi(ph). I -- I got invited to her wedding, but of course it was during the war, so I didn't go.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Okay, so anyway, it -- it was -- it was very hard for my sister, because you know, she had that baby, and she had to go back to work. And I worked -- oh, I haven't told you about my work.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I--I- well, when I go back a little bit to 39, because I told you we only thought the war would last very short. So, my father decided that I should go to Berlin, to a household school, you know, e-economy.</p></p></dialogue>

It was very nice, but you know, that -- that was interesting, but of course, the war wasn't over, you know. And so I came back, and then I ha -- I don't quite remember this, but somehow I think I went someplace to learn Spanish, which I have never mastered in my entire life; I've taken three more Spanish classes, I just can't do -- seem to do it. But anyway, and then I had to go to work. And you know, the -- the thing that completely disrupted my life, is that I had always wanted to go to medical school, from probably the time I was 12 or 13. And of course, in Germany I was not permitted. And in England I had been -- you know, I had started -- I was gonna go to the University of London Medical School, but you know, so that was out.

And he said -- now, this Nazi said to them, that's fine. Then I'll close my practice. And of course they couldn't afford that, because he had all these blue collar workers and those regular workers. So they said okay, hire her. And I will tell you, they were the loveliest people. They had an apartment -- two apartments put together, and one was the practice, and the other was the -- where they lived. He and his wife, they had two sons and a daughter. It was hard work, because we had to be there -- I had to be there at eight o'clock in the morning, and then we worked til about 1:30 or so, and then there were two hours off, and then I was back at 3:30, and then we worked til eight o'clock at night.</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So he came -- his brother was already in New York, but he came at the very last minute, in 1939, and went to that farm, Hyde(ph) Farmland, which, unfortunately was run only by those kids, who didn't really know much about farming, and it went -- well, about eight months after my husband got there. And at that point, of course, there were all these kids, you know.</p></p></dialogue>

And he drove a milk truck. As he always told me, the tips he got, he used to buy a radio. And so he drove a milk truck for a while, a year or so, and then he got a job with a woman called Mrs. Summerall(ph), who had a nursery in Media, Pennsylvania. And he also -- she had a room where he could sleep. And she really loved him. And she said -- she said to me later too, I always said to him, if your hands were as good as your mind, then you would make a good [indecipherable] but your hands are not as good --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: As your mind.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Right. And he --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: What a sweet way of putting it.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And -- but she kept him, and even though he wasn't really very good. I mean, it was just not him to -- to be working the earth. But he saved enough money to go to Penn State, of ill repute.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Let me make a point at this point of the interview, we're talking about a current news item, in November 2011, about a scandal at Penn State, dealing with the football team.</p></p></dialogue>

So the money lasted for a year.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, the poor man.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And, of course, it was a working -- stuff. I mean, he worked in the, I don't know, cafeteria or something. But fortunately, by now it was the end -- early deg42, and he got drafted. And one thing I have never understood in this country lately, is when he was drafted, they naturalized him. They naturalized all the boys right away. Now how we can have all these kids now in the military who are not citizens?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, so I don't -- I -- that I don't understand, because I know that my husband was naturalized, I -- I can't remember what the -- it was in New Jersey in some fort, whatever the name of it is.

I'm sure it was. And then he -- then he wa -- actually, I met him when he was discharged, because, you know, a lot of G.I.s took a discharge in Europe and then took a contract with what was then called the war department.

But he was -- he was a nice guy, I mean, and we -- we worked mostly in the warehouse, where they had, you know, staples of supplies, like food and stuff, and rats, too. But he was very nice, because every Friday, he gave us a package, a care package to take home. And believe me, the time right after the war was the most difficult one, as far as food and -- and heating goes. I mean, there wasn't any food, and there was no coal to heat. So it was -- fortunately [indecipherable] the military government, and met somebody who had coal, so we were able to get some coal, but it -- the food was really very, very short, and I got lunch every day at the military government. They had a canteen and they fed all of us. Lot of creamed corn, and -- but that's okay, I mean -- and Spam. But, you know, when you're hungry, you're happy to eat anything.</p></p></dialogue>
