<dialogue class=""><p>Judith Heimann, taking place on November 21", 2011, in Bethesda, Maryland. Good afternoon, Mrs. Heimann. Thank you so much for agreeing to talk to us.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It's a pleasure.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And I will start the interview as I explained at the beginning. I would like to know when you were born, where you were born, who your parents were, who your family was, and we'll take it from there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Okay. Well, I was born on August 23", 1920, which my grandson says I was always old. As far as he's concerned, I was always old. And I was born in Frankfurt; both my parents were from Frankfurt. My mother was Jewish, my father was not. My father comes from an old farming family.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was his name?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Peter Bartmann.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Bartmann?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. B-a-r-t-m-a-double n.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And all his ancestors were dairy farmers, including my grandparents, whom I did not know; I did not know his parents. My mother, on the other hand, came from a banking family, and her maiden name was Hahn, h-a-h-n. And my great-grandfather, I think it was, [indecipherable] is hanging there on the wall, established a banking house. Of</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="0"></span> Interview with Judith Heimann :</p><p> November 21, 2011</p><p> course, like all Jews, they originally lived in the ghetto in Frankfurt, and they were</p><p> moneychangers, I guess. That's, you know, how most of them started. And then, I think</p><p> my grandfather's grandfather -- that's my grandfather, and that's my great-grandfather.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Those two pictures up there --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- and their -- mm-hm?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And on my mother's side. And he started a bank, which was called L.A. Hahn. And</p><p> all their initials were L.A. And it later became a public -- publicly traded bank which was</p><p> called Deutsche Effecten-und Wechselbank.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Deutsche Effecten-und Wechselbank?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. And, in fact, the house is still standing and it's a historic -- has a historic</p><p> designation of the bank, but --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So the ba -- the bank's building and facility?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, the bank's building. It's really just the outside, because the rest was destroyed</p><p> during the war, but the outside is still standing. So anyway, they had a bank. And of</p><p> course you may know that in Frankfurt there were lots of mixed marriages.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, I wanted to ask you about that, you know, how was it that your parents even</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> met? What brought the -- brought their worlds together?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I really just don't know, but -- but my father was -- my grandparents ha -- on my</p><p> father's side had three boys, and my father was the youngest. Clearly the apple of my  <span class="page-break" number="1"></span>  Interview with Judith Heimann deg November 21, 2011 grandmother's eye. And he is the only one who went to university, and he had a law -- he got a law degree. And I think he was very society minded. And he --I-- I'll show you later upstairs, I have a -- an old program from something at the [indecipherable] opera, where he danced with some lady. And I have a feeling that that's how they met, because he was really very interested in getting up there somehow. He was also a champion tennis player. He was German master in 1910, which was a different tennis game from what it is now, but nevertheless.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It's still something, it's an achievement, you know, in competition with others in your area.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, yeah, I -- I have all the trophies upstairs. And he also played the piano very well, and he used to accompany singers or play in small trios. So I'm --I am sure that's how they met somehow, in -- in a dance, or whatever.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What kind of personality did he have?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: My fa--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: How would you -- mm-hm, how would you describe it?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My father should have been a diplomat. He was one of the most tactful people I've ever known, and really was charming. I mean, everybody just loved him. And he -- he just -- he ended up being a banker, because he finally took over my grandparents bank. But he -- he should have been a diplomat. He -- he was not very strict, but you know, I -- I grew up at a time that my parents weren't home that much, and I had a-- a wonderful -- I don't  <span class="page-break" number="2"></span>  Interview with Judith Heimann deg November 21, 2011 know, now you call it nanny, I guess, but it wa -- she was just a young woman whom they hired, and who took care of the kids, and did other stuff, too. And she is really the one who -- who raised me, more or less. Not that I didn't see my parents, I mean, I saw them quite a bit, but -- we always had meals together. We always ate -- we used to get the -- and you know, in Europe yo-you eat your main meal at noon, I mean.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And so we always had that together, but I don't -- in the evening they were often gone.</p><p>But, you know, he was a very nice person.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, were you the oldest child?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. My sister was two years older.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And what's her name?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Her name was Ruth.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Ruth. And you then were born in what year?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Ruth.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Ah, no, Ruth -- what year were you born in?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was born in 1920.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: 1920. And --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And she was born 1918.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: 1918. And what I had forgotten to ask earlier, your mother's maiden name, and her name.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> Interview with Judith Heimann " November 21, 2011</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My mother's name was Marguerata(ph) Helena Hahn, h-a-h-n.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay, Marguerata(ph) Helena.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But she was called Margar(ph).</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And so then they -- you know, my father, I remember, he is -- at the time I had allergic eczema, which of course, when I was a child they didn't know it was allergy. And I remember my father always at night bandaging my arms, so that I wouldn't scratch, you know. But you know, I don't really know if it was so often. It just -- your memory just plays tricks on you. Anyway, it was -- it was very nice. I grew up -- well, my family, I guess they had a lot of money, but I didn't really know that, you know? I -- it never occurred to me that I lived different from a lot of other people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, what do you remember about your home; both as a physical structure, and about the kind of life that you and your f-- your parents and your sister; and whoever else was there, the -- the young girl who was part of your household; what was that like? So let's talk about all of it. Describe it a bit.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, we lived -- and later when we've finished I'll show you the pictures, because I have pict -- pictures on the wall of -- of my --I grew up in what used to be my grandparents dairy farm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That is your father's parents?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="4"></span>  Interview with Judith Heimann deg November 21, 2011</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. And it was a regular farm in a U-shape, with the main house on one side, and then what used to be the barns in a U-shape around it. In the middle was a -- a well. And of course we didn't have any animals any more -- I mean, we had dogs, but -- and chickens, but not the cows and stuff. So we used the barns mainly for garages.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: For what?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: For garage.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And also for our bicycles and -- and tools and stuff.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did it still look like a farm, or did it look like a villa in the outskirts of town?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, it looked like a farm. And it [indecipherable] three acres. And it actually, when I grew up, was no longer on the outskirts of -- of town, it was in town.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see, in Frankfurt itself.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes. So it -- you know, the streetcar was a half a block away. So it -- then I took the streetcar to go to wo -- to go to school. So it -- it was really in the middle of town. And the one thing I really regret, it -- it has been razed now, and I regret that because if historic preservation had come into life sooner, that thing would have stayed, because it's very unusual to have a farm in the middle of --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Of course.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- of town.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Of course.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="5"></span>  Interview with Judith Heimann deg November 21, 2011</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: But, you know, in any ca -- in any case, where -- the main house, when you faced it, sat on the left, and it was really very beautiful. It was big house, and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: How would you describe its style, its architectural style?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Hm?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How would you describe its architectural style?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, it was just --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Twenty -- turn of the century.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: A stucco house.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay, okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And it had a -- a gate in the front, which usually was open because we had cars, but you could close the gate, and then it had a driveway, long driveway, which led you into the courtyard. And next door was a boys" school, which was kind of nice when I grew up.</p><p>But it was really just beautiful, and we had a large, just garden for -- to enjoy, and then we had a lot of vegetables, and we had chickens. A-And -- and we did have a lot of help. I-I think we probably had three maids, and -- and there was, from the -- across the courtyard from the main house, there was th -- at the end of the last barn there was another little house, and the -- I don't know what the guy's name, it was sort of a -- like a -- a super in  <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> ontactrefiranneGaushariarg a hither atrmedortabeattfiexaliaton</p><p> Interview with Judith Heimann deg November 21, 2011 an apartment building. He and his wife lived there, and you know, he would tend the furnace, and do stuff like that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So the ka -- kind of housekeepers.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah. And -- and then we had a gardener who lived in the same place upstairs, and I -- I think we had three maids and a cook, but I can't -- yeah, I think we had three maids and a cook. So I sometimes wonder what my mother did all day, but --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Well, tell me a little bit about her. If I asked you about what your father's personality was like, what was hers like?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My mother enjoyed ill health.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh gosh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, she -- she was -- I'm sure she had some ill health, but if she -- if she did, I know, had a stomach operation early in her marriage. I have a feeling it all -- it had to do with nerves too, you know? And then she, in 1929 she had a major operation, I -- I don't know if it was a hysterectomy, or something like that. And what is very unfortunate, she had a surgeon who was addicted to morphine, and he got her addicted.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh dear.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And she was addicted the rest of her life.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh dear, what a tragedy.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And that was very unfortunate, because she was really a very wonderful person. But of course, I was only nine when this started, so I never really knew what a wonderful</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion</p><p> Interview with Judith Heimann " November 21, 2011 person she was. I knew it mainly through other people, who told me about it. She was, you know, she had -- of course had not gone to college, but she was pretty smart, and she had a lot of common sense. And she was very -- she had a lot of empathy. And I'l tell you a little story, during the depression, you know, in -- starting in 1930, I guess, when there was so much poverty in Germany, she started a soup kitchen at our house.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Wow.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And it's one of my most vivid memories. We -- the kitchen door was on the side, and the kitchen door had -- had sort of a window you could raise up to the outside. And we would have, every day, about 20 people who came. After a while, we started giving out little slips to people, to say which day they could come, and -- with their name. And I know I used to write those slips, which is why I remember it so well. And then they would come starting at noon, and our cook would have a big soup, you know, something substantial, and bread. And we had benches in the courtyard. And if it was raining, we put them in the -- one of the barns. And then the people would eat their lun-lunch, or main meal, I guess. In fact, we had one couple that found each other and got married. And then on Christmas, she always had everybody come, and she -- they got -- the men got shaving cream and stuff like that, and the women got some other stuff. He -- they -- they all got the little bag with goodies. So she really, I mean, and that was entirely my mother's make -- doing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's a very kind thought.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> </p><p> Interview with Judith Heimann " November 21, 2011</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And she really, I mean, that's the kind of person she was. But, of course, the addiction was dreadful, because you know, a-an addiction to morphine is the same as -- as a heroin addiction, or any other. It's unpredictable. The mood can be -- one day you think, oh, she's wonderful, and then you talk a lot, and then the next day she's gone again, you know. And -- and she did go into rehab twice in Germany, and then it was better for a while, but it never lasted. And then when she came to this country -- you know, I don't know where she got her morphine. That's sometimes the curse of having money. And -- but a -- it was the same in -- in Tucson, where she lived, I mean, she -- and in the end, it wa -- was just awful. But you know, tha-that is -- that was very sad, really.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. And hard for children.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But, you know, it -- the one thing I-- I -- I have told this to my kids from the day they were born, in order to make sure that they stayed away from all drugs, because I told them how horrible this is.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, the price that people pay. The price that the family pays, the price that the person pays.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: It-- it's -- it's -- it's really very sad. But, you know -- and -- and I know -- I mean, we all know it was -- it was her surgeon who got her addicted, and he was addicted him -- a lot of doctors are addicted, I think.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion</p><p> Interview with Judith Heimann " November 21, 2011</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Well, before that happened, you would have been nine years or less, but you mention that your parents would go out in the evenings. Did they -- did they enjoy each other's company?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, they did. And -- and, as I think I want to -- I mean, they got divorced in 38. I think it had na -- it had absolutely nothing to do with the fact that my mother was Jewish, and my father wasn't. My sister and I saw that divorce coming for years. Which doesn't mean they weren't friendly. They were very friendly, they always talked to each other and -- and -- but, you know, I -- it's very hard to look at your parents and think about sex.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's true.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But I think it was very -- they were incompatible. That's what I think, you know, and I think that my father wasn't that interested in it, and my mother was more interested in it, and do I think that was the basis for the divorce. Because she got married again, but -- to the guy that she'd been going with for years, anyway.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you all know about that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yes. Kids always know everything. Kids know everything.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You know, you just -- you think your kids don't know? Kids always know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="10"></span>  4</p><p> Interview with Judith Heimann November 21, 2011</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, we -- we both knew -- my sister and I both knew it. But -- and -- but you know, that's the way it was, and I know my father knew it. But you know, tha -- it didn't seem -- that's why I think that that was the basis.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And they were -- when my mother died, six months before my father, and the one who grieved the most was my father. So, you know, they were --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: There was a bond.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah, that wa -- they were just always -- and he came over here and visited with her and her husband, and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: This is after the war, yes?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And -- and during -- and after the war she went back to Germany once and stayed with my father, you know, so --I mean, they were very good friends, they really liked each other. It's just, I think in bed they didn't mesh. So, you know, I mean, yeah, you don't think about that when you're a child.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you -- as you were growing up, were you upset by these things, were you hurt by these things?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, we just knew that it was going on.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="11"></span> Interview with Judith Heimann 6 November 21, 2011</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: You know, and -- and that this guy, I mean, I could never stand her second husband, but -- and I think partly, perhaps because I felt he interfered, but I'm not sure I just didn't like him anyway. But, no, he -- he -- he was a friend of the family and he -- they traveled together, all of them, and you know, it -- it was -- was just one of those --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Your grandparents on both sides, the in-laws, the larger, extended family, did they like each other? Did they get along?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: When my -- I -- my father's parents were dead when I was born.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So I don't know anything about that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What about your uncles, his brothers?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: His brothers, they were odd. Neither one of them got married. His older brother, the oldest one I think was gay. I'm pretty sure he was gay. In fact, I'm sure he was gay. And he lived not very far from where we lived, and he had a little -- sort of a-- in Germany you know you -- you sometimes have these little yards, that you can bring -- where there are little houses that you [indecipherable]. Well, he had one of those little houses on our property, which of course was where he grew up, and he would come and -- and -- in the summer with his friends, and so on and so forth. But -- and his other brother I really never knew. He died in 1921.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Ah. Yeah, so, you to --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="12"></span> Interview with Judith Heimann a November 21, 2011</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And so I- I never knew him. But the fa -- th-the older one, I knew quite well. He died in deg31, and--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: What was his name?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But we -- Heinrich(ph).</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Heinrich(ph), mm-hm. Uncle Heinrich(ph).</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: But -- and I think some of the problem stemmed from the fact that she was the middle child, because the youngest one, who was 10 years younger than my mother --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Ah yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- was obviously my grandmother's --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Favorite, huh?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.

I'll tell you, this goes back, I think, maybe to the war of 1848, or something like that, or maybe the 1870 war. I'm not sure which war, but some war, where you could not serve if you had different citizenship, and you could buy the Swiss citizenship.</p></p></dialogue>

And my father at that point, was working at a different bank that belonged to my grandmother's brother. And then, in deg34 or so, I think, they asked my father to leave that bank and come to the Deutsche Effecten Wechselbank.

And of course, how banking, you know, it was altogether different. What was very nice -- you know, Frankfurt was occupied in nine -- in March of 1945, a couple of months before the end of the war. And I think the day after we were occupied, this Jeep drove up and asked for my father, and he was there, because at that point nobody went anyplace. And they took him in the Jeep, and left. And we were a little worried, you know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Imean, they were Americans, of course, but you know --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- we were a little worried.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And then he said yes, the Americans had that -- this and that and the other, so I said to him, as long as you're talking to the Americans, ask them if--I could work there as an interpreter, and I did. So -- but it was a scary minute when they came with the Jeep and picked him up and we didn't know what was going on.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Let's go back to the 30s, and let's see if I can ask one last question about your grandparents. Grandma's taller than Grandpa. His -- his nickname is Bubish(ph) --</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. Well, you know, of course, it was a different time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And I certainly didn't have the relationship with my grandparents that I have with my own grandchildren now.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Because they were people of respect, you know, and so --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: It's more formality.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. It wasn't a ra -- I liked them and they liked us, but it wasn't a close relation -- I mean, I -- I would not go and tell them a story, or anything like that. But -- and my grandparent -- my grandfather had a --a favorite thing. When my parents called, if we were in -- in one of their houses in K6nigstein, and my parents called and say how are the kids, and my grandfather would say, they are so nice when they're asleep. But that was a favorite saying.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Of course, of course.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But you know, they were nice, and -- and I enjoyed them, but I can't say I had a close relationship with them. But we enjoyed each other. And then they -- my grandfather died in Los Angeles.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: After the war?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="33"></span> Interview with Judith Heimann " November 21, 2011</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In 1945, I think.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh my.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, in 1941, my mother and my aunt were at that point both in the United States.</p><p>My mother lived in Tucson, and my aunt lived in Santa Monica. And my grandparents decided to come and spend Christmas with them in 1941. Which was not a good idea, because that way they couldn't get back.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because you know what happened in 1941. So they were stuck in Los Angeles. So they spent the war in Los Angeles.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: On the other hand it's a very good idea.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So then my fa -- and my grandfather died there. I mean, he was 89, but you know, he -- he died there, and my grandmother went back to Switzerland.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: After he died. She went back in "47.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So a-- yes, it's -- Switzerland was safe, but still, Los Angeles was a bit safer.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yeah, it was. But they --I think they were sorry they were not in their home.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In Switzerland, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: You know.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="34"></span> </p><p> Interview with Judith Heimann * November 21, 2011</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: What is it that I wanted to ask you now? Ah, at the very beginning you mentioned that there were many mixed marriages in Frankfurt --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- when your parents got married. Tell me a little bit about identity, if one can. Was your family, your mother's side of the family very Jewish?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, apparently not. I mean, I --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And how does one define not being very Jewish?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, I -- I don't know. I mean, I all -- I always knew that my grandparents were Jews, and that my mother was Jewish by heritage. Which, I know a lot of other girls I knew who were in the same boat did not know, and were absolutely shocked in "33.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. I knew several of them, where they just never knew that they had any connection to Jews. My grandparents, I don't know that they ever went to synagogue, but I know Yom Kippur seemed to fall mainly during farm vacations, and we often spent our farm vacations at my grandparents" house in K6nigstein, and my grandmother always locked herself into a bedroom on Yom Kippur, and said she was fasting. Now, my cousin, and we always said, well, she's got the cupboard full of cookies, and she's probably not fasting, but I don't know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="35"></span> </p><p> Interview with Judith Heimann * November 21, 2011</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: She may well have been fasting. But that is all I know, that -- that was the only Jewish thing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In the house.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah. So they -- as I said, my mother's youngest sister, I think was a devout Jew, but I never knew her. And now --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So the fact that your parents came from different -- now, was your father's family Lutheran, or Catholic?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: German Reformed.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, German Reformed, okay, so Protestant.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Which is much better than Lutheran, and has nothing to do with Catholic.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No, it has nothing to do with Catholic.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I--I tell you, German Reformed was a small group in Frankfurt, which had been persecuted in the late 1800s.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, and we -- our church -- and I was brought up in that church -- our church had -- you couldn't see from the outside that it was a church, it just looked like a house. Had no stained glass windows, no tower, no bell, no nothing. But inside there was a real church.</p><p>And it was a small congregation. My father was very active in it after the war, I don't know. He and my sister got into religion, and I don't know why, but -- which is not where</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="36"></span>  40 Interview with Judith Heimann November 21, 2011 I got. And so there were a lot of old Frankfurt families that belonged to the German Reform. There's also French Reform, but -- which came from the Huguenots, you know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Ah, okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: There were a lot of Huguenots that came from France to the Frankfurt area, and there -- you find a lot of French names there. But this was German Reform. Now, we always had Christmas, and my mother's birthday happened to be on the 25" of December.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, the poor thing. No double presents.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. And my daughter's on the 23". And I remember that my grandparents used to come for her birthday, and we always got Christmas presents. I mean, there was nothing of Hanukkah, anything like that. So, at -- somehow they -- they had sort of embraced my fam -- my father's family, and -- and I don't know, and I think a lot of those mixed marriages in Frankfurt were that way. And I knew a lot of people who were in mixed marriages. I -- I think it was, if you pardon the expression, more the upper crust, you know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But, it -- it just was nothing unusual.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It's interesting to know that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="37"></span>  Interview with Judith Heimann " November 21, 2011</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You know, it's interesting, because I had interviews with people at other parts of Europe --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- where there was a mixed matriage, and it was highly unusual, highly unusual. Be -- it was different societies, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah -- no, in Frankfurt it was every day, you know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you see yourself as Christian? Did you have any feeling of being Christian?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, I tell you, I grew up, of course, since -- since we seemed to be more on my father's religion, I went to confirmation class, I was confirmed in the German Reform church. And then I married my husband. And he didn't want to have anything to do with religion, period, because he said he can't believe that any God would allow what happened, you know. So, he said, you do whatever you want to do. So since I grew up that way, I had both my kids baptized, which is more than my son has done, or -- and it didn't mean anything to me, it was -- I did it more to please my father, because at that point he and my sister were very engaged in that church. And so | had them both baptized -- they both went to -- I joined briefly the Westmoreland Congregational Church here, because I was looking for a church that wasn't too churchy. And so that was fine, and the kids went there for -- for Sunday school, til they were about nine or 10, and then they said we -- all we do is draw pictures. And they both went to [indecipherable] Friends, which of course, the Quaker school. Somehow I tend more to Jewish stuff now. It's not that I  <span class="page-break" number="38"></span> Interview with Judith Heimann deg November 21, 2011 would join a synagogue, or do anything on that order, but I find it more interesting. And you know, my daughter married a Jew, and -- the family is interesting. I mean, my daughter married a Jew, Steven is in -- belongs to the Episcopal church. His wife is a lapsed Catholic who won't cross any church's door. The kids were not baptized, but my daughter's three boys were -- had a Bar Mitzvah. They -- they --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And try and figure out the identity, yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, they belong to the synagogue, and now her two older boys -- the middle boy is never going to -- interested anything.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You're talking about your daughter's children?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My daughter's three boys. The middle boy -- the two older ones are in college, and my daughter has said to them, you know, you are Bar Mitzvahed, and you do what you want to do, and it's your choi -- call now. The older one claims that he kept the high holidays.</p><p>The younger -- the middle one will have nothing to do with any of it. The youngest one, who is still in high school, is very interested. So, you know, I think si-- my son's three children were baptized, but that's about it. And I don't think they ever go to church or do anything. It-- you know, families are interesting.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. And it also is a reality that somehow or other, you know, gets pushed into anar -- you know, political forces. Because now I want to bring back to how somebody defines themself, is from the inside, and how you are defined by others from the outside.</p></p></dialogue>

Not only di-- yeah, so not only did kids see you as the rich girl --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I went to private school first.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. So let's talk about that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The same one that my mother went to, my sister went to, and in fact, my nieces -- my niece went to. A little private school in Frankfurt. Now, for reasons that I cannot fathom, my sister had -- who is two years old -- who was two years older, as I told you, had changed to a public school, when she got into high school, I guess.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And that public school was on the other side of the river. I don't even know why, but it was supposed to be so good, you know. Which was fine. That was in 1931. Now, my time came in 1933.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's a very crucial time.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Good afternoon, this is track 14, and a conua -- continuation of our interview with Mrs. Judith Heimann, in Bethesda, Maryland, on November 21", 2011, and we were talking about schools --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- and your experience in school, and you were saying that when you started pub -- public school, it was 1933.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: 1933.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And so what do you remember about that time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, that was a very unfortunate choice that my parents made, I -- 1 -- I mentioned earlier that my mother was not well.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And in early "33, she had a nervous breakdown, which I think was related to Hitler's taking o -- my mother is one of the very few people that I know, who had read "Mein Kampf," and knew what was coming. And so I think she had a nervous breakdown, and therefore didn't really think about my school. I mean, I do -- I don't blame her, you know, when you're sick, you're sick. So anyway, they sent me to public school, and of course in 1933, you shouldn't send a half-Jew to public school who -- when you have a private school where you've been.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="42"></span>  46</p><p> Interview with Judith Heimann November 21, 2011</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: The explanation was that that private school would require Greek for graduation, and they didn't want to have me do that, but you know, I-I --I think that's a lame excuse, because you know, other kids could learn it too, so why couldn't I have learned what I needed to learn? But in any case, they sent me --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Do you think they just weren't thinking?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I think nobody thought much, because I think it was a horrible time. A-And you know, you change schools in Germany, or you didn't; in any case, I don't know what it's like now; on Easter, after Easter, that's when the new year starts. And that was pretty soon after Hitler took over, and I think they just never thought. In any case, I went to that school, and there was one a -- one more half-Jewish girl in the class, and one girl who was a full Jew, and the rest were not. The other half-Jewish girl, unfortunately her last name was Solomon, which of course, a much more Jewish name than Bartmann was. And we had a classroom teacher who was really a Nazi. And some of the other teachers were too, and of course, some of the girls were. And it was not always pleasant. There -- I --I did have two or three friends, or four sa -- more even. In fact, one of my high school friends is still alive, like I am. She lives in Frankfurt, and my niece takes care of her, because she never married, and she's alone, and so my niece takes care of her. But -- and she was my friend. PII tell you about her in a minute, because she is also an interesting case. But, you know, like on Saturdays, for instance -- you were always on the outside -- on Saturdays, anybody who belonged to the BDM, you know, Bund Deutscher Machen(ph) --</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="43"></span> </p><p> Interview with Judith Heimann " November 21, 2011</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Bund Deutscher Madel.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- was off. But those of us who didn't, had to come to school. And there were about 10 of us in the class, six or eight who had to come to school, and then we had meaningless classes, because we had to have meaningless class, because the others weren't there. But, you know, you were an outsider. I mean, you weren't part of the group. And --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did the teachers treat you differently? Were they -- was -- was your teacher, for example, did she treat you differently?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, we had this one tea -- they were mostly men, their -- the classroom teacher was our Latin teacher also, and I don't know, I got terrible grades. I was very poor -- I-I wouldn't say I was -- I never did homework, which didn't help. And -- and I was a little heavy at the time, and quite busty. And he would always say, you seem to be leaning on the table like a pudding.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, that's very cruel to say.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Which is not really what you like to hear, you know?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And in any case, from him I got horrible grades. I think he taught Latin and French.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How does one say that, by the way, in German?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Hm?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You're leaning on the table like a pudding. [speaks German]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [speaks German]</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="44"></span>  48</p><p> Interview with Judith Heimann November 21, 2011</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: That's very cruel to a 13 year old.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, it's horrible.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And I got really terrible grades, and -- and the more -- I think he tried psychology on me, but it didn't work. And the more he did this, the worse I got in school. And a -- one semester he was not there, and I got very good grades from some other teacher. So, I mean, I -- I think a lot had to do with that. In any case, I went there for three years, and I really -- I mean, I wasn't unhappy, but it was just not a good experience. It -- it was stupid.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So -- but you felt the -- you felt the atmosphere, I guess that -- that's what --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Absolutely, absolutely. Now, for instance, we had -- the school had sort of a summer place, or a --a place in the country where they would take the -- each class for -- for a week at a time, or something. Now, the girl who was a full Jew was not allowed to go.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>And the other one who wa -- whose name was Solomon, they debated for a long time whether she could go. Now, they didn't say anything to me, because my last name was --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Bartmann, yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- different. But, you know, you always weren't sure, were you go -- were you gonna be able to do this, and of course, you want to do this when --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Of course.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- go with your class, you know.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="45"></span> Interview with Judith Heimann &gt;&gt; November 21, 2011</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Of course.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And there were many things like that, that you felt people are looking at you in a different way.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Was this -- are you say-saying now, not only in school, but in general, when you were</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, that came later.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: That was not in school, I didn't notice that so much. But somehow it was -- it was very unfortunate. And then my sister had gone to boarding school in England, in 1935, I think. And in 1936 -- I-I'm trying to get the dates right, yes, I think it was 1936, they decided I would go to -- to a--a boarding school in England. And I ha --I didn't know this til almost the end of the school year -- of course, that was the time nobody asked you if you want to do this, you were just simply told, that's what you're doing. And so I said to that classroom teacher, I said, I'm leaving. Whereupon he said to me, if you had told me sooner, I would have given you the grades you really deserve, but I didn't know you weren't coming back. Which was very interesting, you know. So he said, you really deserved better. But anyway, you know --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: [indecipherable]</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="46"></span> ontactrefiranneGaushariarg a hither atrmedortabeattfiexaliaton</p><p> Interview with Judith Heimann *deg November 21, 2011</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- you -- you just don't know. So I went to boarding school in England, which I absolutely hated. My sister loved it, I just absolutely hated it. But part of it, I think, was because my mother had left Germany at the end of "34, I think.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Is that when she left the home?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. That's when she went to England.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And it may have been early deg35, like I'm not a hundred percent sure of the date. And my sister had gone to boarding school, so I was home alone with my father, who was very lenient, and I did what I wanted to do. Not homework for sure, but -- but everything else. I just had a good time. And then I went to England to this boarding school, where every minute of the day is programmed.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh. It's like prison.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I mean there -- yeah. I mean, there is no escape. You leave your -- at that time, you -- you leave your bedroom, which, well the bedroom was for all the girls, at 7:30 in the morning for breakfast, and you're not allowed to come back til the evening. You have to take everything you have to have, with you. Well, I hated the whole place, and I was there for one year. Nobody had asked me if I wanted to go, but I went. And then, after the year, they decided I would go to Switzerland to learn French. Now there, I will say, they gave me a choice of two different schools, which I went, inspected with my father. And one of the things I had hated in that boarding school, among other things, was the</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="47"></span> Interview with Judith Heimann * November 21, 2011 bathrooms, which you shared with a million kids. So I chose the little school, where you had a bathroom where you could lock the door. So I went there, and there were only about 40 of us, maybe 35 kids. I really enjoyed that. It was very nice, I was very good in French, which I don't remember at all any more, but it was -- it was really very nice, and there were many girls from England, probably about 10 or 11 girls from London, and there were three Americans -- no, there were four Americans. And then the rest was different. One girl was from Haifa, she was an Arab, and there were some Italians and a couple of Swiss. It was interesting -- and that's a sideline that I knew there was a big kerfuffle at the beginning, in the American room -- they -- they stupidly, they -- there was one other German girl, and I don't know why they would put us together in a room with -- with a Greek girl and an Italian girl, and they put all four American girls into one room.</p><p>And I knew there was a big kerfuffle, but I never understood -- I mean, we just didn't know. And it was only after I was in this country for a while, and looked at the pictures that I realized that one of the girls was black. Very light black, but she was black. And I'm sure that's what the kerfuffle was all about. She was from San Francisco, her name was Georgia Naifi(ph). I -- I got invited to her wedding, but of course it was during the war, so I didn't go.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But, you know, it didn't dawn on me. I never even saw that she was black when I was over there. I'd never seen a black girl, and she was very light, and you know, what did I  <span class="page-break" number="48"></span> </p><p> Interview with Judith Heimann ~ November 21, 2011 know? I never knew she was black, but when I looked at old pictures, I suddenly thought, now I know what went on there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Now, I come back to the same question that I had earlier, of how you perceive yourself, and how other perceive you. In that school, in the school in Switzerland, were you seen as a German girl, or a Jewish girl, or both, or --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I--I think as a German girl.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And in London -- or in England?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In England, a German girl.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: A German girl, okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No question.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And in -- now, in that school in Switzerland we had a couple of Jewish girls. I mean, I know one of the American girls was a Jew from New York, and we had an interesting British girl, Naomi de Rothschild, whom I visited in London with a butler and a elevator in the -- a really -- now they really lived, you know. But it was -- no, I -- I mean, I would look the par -- I don't know about the other German girl. She was clearly an Aryan. If she was a Nazi, I'm not -- I really can't tell, because at that point we -- we don't talk about that, you know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, outside of the country, what was going on politically didn't have muc -- in school life, didn't have an im-impact.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay, okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I felt it clearly.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, at home, you said your mother had read "Mein Kampf," that she had a nervous breakdown when the Nazis came to power.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Had there been political discussions in your home about what's going on in the country?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: There were dis -- political discussions, yes, and I know, you know, as I said before, we had -- there were maids, and they were all Catholics, and they all asked my parents how to vote always. And so we -- we heard all these things, you know. And there were the discussions on -- you know, at that point I can't remember, you know, the Nazis killed off one of their own, I can't remember what his name was, but -- and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: The Brownshirts, you mean?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>

She had been a maid with a Jewish family in Frankfurt who left, and she was extremely fond of them, and then was very happy with us too. So we were lucky in -- with these people.

And I said well, I guess by the time -- by this time next week, we won't be lying in the grass any more, we'd be bombed. Well, of course, took another two years to get any air raids in Frankfurt, but I don't know, I think, in retrospect, I think I probably could have left in time.</p></p></dialogue>

But, on the other hand, I was very fond of my father.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was he the po -- parent you were closer to?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: It was sad, you know, it is sad. I was clearly, I -- | was German, you know, and -- and -- and just think -- I mean, it's a different story, but just think when this country, we lost Vietnam, which was annoying, to put it mildly. But, you know, when it's -- when you're in the country, and you know the only way this country can really survive, and you can survive, is if that country --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Loses.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- loses the war. I knew if the -- if we didn't lose the war, we were goners, you know, there was no question in my mind. So, for very selfish reasons --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- you hoped that the country will lose the war. But it's hard when it's your own country, because I was clearly German. There wasn't any question in my mind. So it -- it wasn't easy.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Okay, so anyway, it -- it was -- it was very hard for my sister, because you know, she had that baby, and she had to go back to work. And I worked -- oh, I haven't told you about my work.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No, I wanted to ask.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I--I- well, when I go back a little bit to 39, because I told you we only thought the war would last very short. So, my father decided that I should go to Berlin, to a household school, you know, e-economy.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How to run a household.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. Which is really stupid. So, we went to Berlin, we got a room, I got a room. We went -- I went to this school where there were mainly young women who were planning to get married very soon, you know. So I wasn't planning on that. And you know, that was very interesting because you know, I was in a strange territory, nobody knew me. I wasn't about to say anything about my heritage, or anything else. And there was one girl who at one point said to me -- I was friendly with her, and she said to me, you know, I</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="56"></span> ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion</p><p> Interview with Judith Heimann degdeg November 21, 2011 have to ask you a question, and I don't want you to take it the wrong way.

And she said, where I come from there's a family by the name of Bartmann and they're Jewish.</p><p>And I said, well that happens to be my Aryan side. And I said, yes Iam. And she said, so am I. And, but you know, neither one of us had said anything to anybody else, and in fact, I was friendly with one woman who I'm sure never knew, and I wasn't about to tell her.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, it could be dangerous.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, well, I mean, you know, there wasn't any point. And the -- this one girl who was half Jewish also, got married to a Norwegian, and we all went to the wedding. It was very nice, but you know, that -- that was interesting, but of course, the war wasn't over, you know. And so I came back, and then I ha -- I don't quite remember this, but somehow I think I went someplace to learn Spanish, which I have never mastered in my entire life; I've taken three more Spanish classes, I just can't do -- seem to do it. But anyway, and then I had to go to work. And you know, the -- the thing that completely disrupted my life, is that I had always wanted to go to medical school, from probably the time I was 12 or 13. And of course, in Germany I was not permitted. And in England I had been -- you know, I had started -- I was gonna go to the University of London Medical School, but you know, so that was out. And so I felt, well, maybe I could work at a doctor's office.</p><p>And we knew a guy who was a radiologist, who also had some Jewish connections, and</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="57"></span> Interview with Judith Heimann *" November 21, 2011 he said, well, I'll ask some of my colleagues, you know.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Very early, hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: He had a practice, a medical practice in the blue collar area in Frankfurt, near the main railroad station.

And he interviewed me, and he said yeah, I think it's fine, and you look right, you know. And then he -- for some reason they have to go to the AMA -- I mean, the equivalent of the AMA in Germany to say they are hiring, and they told him he couldn't hire a half-Jew. And he said -- now, this Nazi said to them, that's fine. Then I'll close my practice. And of course they couldn't afford that, because he had all these blue collar workers and those regular workers. So they said okay, hire her. And I will tell you, they were the loveliest people. They had an apartment -- two apartments put together, and one was the practice, and the other was the -- where they lived. He and his wife, they had two sons and a daughter. It was hard work, because we had to be there -- I had to be there at eight o'clock in the morning, and then we worked til about 1:30 or so, and then there were two hours off, and then I was back at 3:30, and then we worked til eight o'clock at night.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="58"></span> Interview with Judith Heimann deg</p><p> November 21, 2011</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I mean, you know, they had a lot of patients, and there weren't that many doctors, and</p><p> I did everything. I mean, he taught me everything. I did the insurance, I did the lab work.</p><p> I mean, the guy taught me everything. He had a horrible temper, and would yell.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you think he joined the party because of a purely career move?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So that never came up in conversation?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No. I never asked him, and it just -- we never talked about those things. He certainly</p><p> was no Nazi at that point.

And they asked me to come with them, but</p><p> at that point my niece was born, and I -- and my sister was working, and I felt I had to</p><p> stay home.

And so he said, well, we'll see that you find another place that we know. And some woman doctor first hired me, and then she was bombed out. And then this guy who lived not very far, like from here to where you turn to Mass Avenue, you know --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- not terribly far. He had his practice there, and he hired me. Now, his wife was a quarter Jew.

I knew exactly who she was. He was the biggest Nazi you ever want to meet. He treated me like a piece of dirt. You know, at that point none of us knew the -- the phrase sexual harassment, but the first week I was there, he chased me around the desk and kept saying, sit, come sit.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: On his knees.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. And I said no, you know, and that was the end of his treating me as a person. I mean, after that -- and of course, I knew I couldn't leave, because it was a job, and if I left the job, I--I risked being deported someplace.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, is this the reason why -- cause I was trying to figure out earlier, when you said that if you had household help at home, you had to go to work.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I didn't know why you had to go to work if you had household help at home, and you have money, why?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="60"></span> Interview with Judith Heimann " November 21, 2011</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no. If you da -- if you had no help, one of you could stay home to do the house.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's how intrusive the party was, in other words.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes. And if-- but if you had help, you couldn't stay home. And being a half Jew, I would have been sent someplace --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I see.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- if I didn't have a job.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So they would have found work for you someplace.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes. What was precisely what he knew. And he knew I couldn't leave. And I had said to him, all is fine, I just would like when we have an air raid, I would like to ride my bicycle home, because my niece -- our maid had the baby, and I said I would like to be there with the baby during the air raid. And he said, fine. Well, he was a big shot in the [indecipherable] you know, and so as soon as there was an air raid siren, he put on his uniform and departed. And he said, take all the files in the basement. So, I -- before anything else, I had to take the files in the basement. And there were many a day when I ri--rode my bicycle home while the bombs were falling, because there wasn't any other way to do it. And it was dark, and you know, and you couldn't put a light on your bicycle. But I always made it home, and we -- we were very lucky, we were not bombed out, although around us -- I mean, sometimes you just don't know why y-you were there.</p><p>I mean, we ha -- we had incendiary bombs in the attic once, but we were able to --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Get rid of them.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="61"></span> ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion</p><p> Interview with Judith Heimann degdeg November 21, 2011</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.

So he got extra food stamps, you know --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Rations.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- for -- yeah, for -- for butter and stuff. Do you think he shared it with his wife? No. It was all just in front of him. And then he had private patients, and had others, you know, like Medicare. And the private patients always got treated very well. The others kept -- you know, I always said, if they have diarrhea, they were told to take Kaopectate, and if they had something other, take three aspirins and go home, you know. I mean, and -- but the private patients --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Different -- different class, different treatment.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I--I mean, he was just awful. And I'Il tell you, the best thing in my life -- not the best thing in my life, but a nice thing in my life, we were occupied -- I mean, you know, we were occupied in March. And we knew it was coming, and you know, there was dead silence for two days. I mean, so silent that you could hear a pin drop everywhere. I mean, there was nothing. And I had gone to work, and he said to me, go to the police department and get an armband, a Red Cross armband for me, or something -- which was on the other side of the river. So I got on my bicycle, and went to the other side of the river, and got to the police department, where people knew me through my brother-in- law. And they said, what are you doing here? And I said, I need to get the -- well, they said, you better get home they be -- they're blowing up the bridges.

And we were chatting with some of these kids. And this Jeep comes, and they have my doctor in that Jeep. So he says to me, he fe -- he spoke no English. He said to me, you speak English and German? I said yes. And he said, just tell them that I'm a very nice guy, and I, you know, mean no harm. So I just said to them, I don't know who he is. And they took him. I mean, they let him go right away after 24 hours --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- but, you know, he was wearing his stupid uniform, you know.

And it was called Persilschein.</p><p>So she asked me for one, for him, and I -- I refused. I said, I really can't give it to you.

And her -- both her so -- both their sons died in the war, and when the war was lost, she said to me, the world is coming to an end for my girls -- they had two girls.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But her own mother died when she was five, and her father married a Jew, a fi -- girl from Frankfurt who was a Jew, who my girlfriend always regarded as her mother, because she was only six when my -- when her father married this woman. So, for all practical purposes, that woman was her mother. However, for the Nazis, it made a big difference, because she had no Jewish blood.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That is the last minute.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes. I think he was on that Bremen that I didn't get onto. Now, he -- it ba -- it's very</p><p> interesting, his mother died when he was 11. His father was a lawyer in a small town, in</p><p> Flaybish(ph) gemund(ph), and I think his father was incapable of having this -- of doing</p><p> anything with the family, you know, he -- he had these two boys, my husband and his</p><p> older brother, who was, I think, five years older. And, so when my husband was, I think --</p><p> first of all, his father and his mother were in a concentration camp for a week.

Now, my husband was clearly one of the youngest, because in 1939, he was only 18, and -- and he -- and they sent him there, I think, when he was 16, or something like that. So he learned this farming, which is not what he really liked, but it was the only way to get here. And then he did get a visa. Now, there was a -- and I don't know how much you know about this: there was a family in Richmond, the Tarnheimers(ph), which had a big department store. And they had a farm near Richmond, which was called Hyde(ph) Farmland, which they established precisely for these kids. And that's where my husband --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Went?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- got a visa for.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So he came -- his brother was already in New York, but he came at the very last minute, in 1939, and went to that farm, Hyde(ph) Farmland, which, unfortunately was run only by those kids, who didn't really know much about farming, and it went -- well, about eight months after my husband got there. And at that point, of course, there were all these kids, you know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What do you do with them?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, the Quakers in Philadelphia came through, and my husband went to Philadelphia and was housed with some Quaker family, I don't know who they were, on</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="77"></span> Interview with Judith Heimann ia November 21, 2011 the Main Line. And he drove a milk truck. As he always told me, the tips he got, he used to buy a radio. And so he drove a milk truck for a while, a year or so, and then he got a job with a woman called Mrs. Summerall(ph), who had a nursery in Media, Pennsylvania. And he also -- she had a room where he could sleep. And she really loved him. And she said -- she said to me later too, I always said to him, if your hands were as good as your mind, then you would make a good [indecipherable] but your hands are not as good --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: As your mind.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Right. And he --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: What a sweet way of putting it.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And -- but she kept him, and even though he wasn't really very good. I mean, it was just not him to -- to be working the earth. But he saved enough money to go to Penn State, of ill repute. Well, my -- Steven's son just graduated from Penn State last year.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Let me make a point at this point of the interview, we're talking about a current news item, in November 2011, about a scandal at Penn State, dealing with the football team.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="78"></span>  3</p><p> Interview with Judith Heimann deg November 21, 2011</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So anyway, he saved enough money to go to Penn State, and he had thought he had saved enough money for four years, but he didn't realize that as a non-citizen, he had to pay out-of-state tuition. So the money lasted for a year.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, the poor man.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And, of course, it was a working -- stuff. I mean, he worked in the, I don't know, cafeteria or something. But fortunately, by now it was the end -- early deg42, and he got drafted. And one thing I have never understood in this country lately, is when he was drafted, they naturalized him. They naturalized all the boys right away. Now how we can have all these kids now in the military who are not citizens?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, so I don't -- I -- that I don't understand, because I know that my husband was naturalized, I -- I can't remember what the -- it was in New Jersey in some fort, whatever the name of it is. So anyway, he was -- he was naturalized, and then they sent him to Champagne, to learn more German. But he -- he was assigned to some infantry and then to the military government, was all, you know.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And I was told that somebody had made an exhibit of this Gross-Rosen --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- experience, which was exhibited at Rutgers University, and I always thought the Holocaust Museum should get it.</p></p></dialogue>

And then he -- then he wa -- actually, I met him when he was discharged, because, you know, a lot of G.I.s took a discharge in Europe and then took a contract with what was then called the war department.

But he was very nice, because every Friday, he gave us a package, a care package to take home.

So it was -- fortunately [indecipherable] the military government, and met somebody who had coal, so we were able to get some coal, but it -- the food was really very, very short, and I got lunch every day at the military government. They had a canteen and they fed all of us. Lot of creamed corn, and -- but that's okay, I mean -- and Spam. But, you know, when you're hungry, you're happy to eat anything.</p></p></dialogue>
