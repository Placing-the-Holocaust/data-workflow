<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, by the grace of God we missed it, and we are alive today.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Never did, because I wouldn't recognize anything, and there's probably nothing there to recognize, hearing from people that have gone back. Now, I have a few landslides here, went back several years ago, and their much older than me -- well, when I say much older, I mean 15 years older, and they couldn't recognize anything. They left like a year or two before me, and they couldn't recognize it, so I definitely wouldn't</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Do you think that your experiences and your husband's experiences from your childhood and his experiences in the war, do you think that had an impact on how you raised your children?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Absolutely</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Can you explain?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, we tried to bring them up for them to know what went on in the war, and to be open about it, and to be strong.</p></p></dialogue>

And, I took them one time when I was working there, and I let them go by themselves through Daniel's story and upstairs a little bit, and they're talking about going back, and I'll take them back.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="13"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I want to ask you, what kinds of things you emphasized about your life story to your children when you told them.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, they were very surprised, but they realized it was very tough, and they are glad that they are here and didn't go through it, and they are stronger people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Is there anything you'd like to add before we conclude today?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We are -- we are glad we are in this country, it's a wonderful country and so for its good and we haven't seen too much anti-Semitism. We hear about it, but we, ourselves, haven't gotten it -- I can't think of the word I want to use, but haven't come across it, and hopefully we won't and my grandchildren won't either.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you ever speak to any groups of people? Perhaps, children, students that came into the museum, who are of the Hispanic background?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Any final reflections on what the war years were like in Cuba, anything -- has anything come to your mind since we started the interview that you would like to add?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, as far as Cuba, it was a beautiful country, but we knew that we were never secure over there. It was a temporary, it was a stop off and it ended up being 11 years over there, and we really couldn't wait for the day to live, hopefully that it would of been a better life in United States, because we didn't know what to expect.</p></p></dialogue>
