<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What did you, personally -- I'm not asking about your family -- what did you, the child, see? And was it what you expected to see?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We didn't know what we were going to expect, except we were hoping for a better life and to have more than what we had in Poland.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell me about this school you started telling me about a moment ago.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was it like for your family in this new culture, not just with respect to religion, but with respect to the culture as oppose to what you had been use to in Poland. Were the problems adjusting to life in Cuba?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: There was a problem adjusting because it was also that we knew we were not liked there, though some of the neighbors were nice, but we were not liked as Jews, and we were also not secure there. So we knew it was also temporary stay -- hoping that sooner than later we would be able to come to this country.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So did you experience anti-Semitism in Cuba? Can you explain?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, we did, because of the way they use to talk to us, especially as children, and kids here at home -- about Jewish kids -- so they use to come home and express it to us and we tried to get away from them, not even to answer them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can you explain some of the -- give me some examples of what you're saying.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yiddish. Again, I'm use to answering Yiddish, and my parents would speak Polish, some Russian because the town we came from was -- it was Poland and it was White Russia, and then it was Poland again.</p></p></dialogue>

Especially, they were afraid the Jewish kids would pick up too much.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was positioned of the population of Cuba just a general population. What were their views on the conflict in Europe?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I truthfully don't remember. Maybe there's a lot that I blocked out.</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember seeing any news reels, or newspapers, or hearing the radio?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh, yeah. There was always -- there was always a Yiddish paper in the house, because that's what my parents read and the radio use to always be on and they use to try and pick up the Yiddish stations there to hear what's going on with the war and everything</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Can you remember anything from that time period?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I don't.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When was the last time you had any contact, you meaning this time your family had any contact with your relatives in Poland?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did your parents have any idea what was truly happening in Europe?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, they knew they didn't want us kids dead, because not only did they hear it, they read it in the papers, but whatever they heard from the family writing, they knew.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What attempts were made by your parents to find relatives or friends after the war was over?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They tried to write to different families that they had in different places in the world, and nobody was able to find anybody.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can you remember when you started hearing the truth about what had happened in Europe?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was after the war and I was already a little bit older, then we really started realizing what was happening, and about killing the Jews and about how we actually struggled on what they did to us and that's why we were persecuted running from place to place, and we just couldn't wait to be able to come to this country. Hopefully it would have been a better life than what we had in Cuba.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you have any -- do you have any good memories of life in Cuba?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not that much, no, because we were persecuted there, too. We knew that it was a Catholic country, and they didn't like us much. There were a few neighbors that were nice, but in majority of them, we knew that we were there temporarily. It was either there or someplace else if we couldn't come to this country.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When you look back on your time in Cuba, were there every any -- anything that you ever did for fun, or with your friends, or with your family, any positive moments, even brief moments that you could share with me?</p></p></dialogue>
