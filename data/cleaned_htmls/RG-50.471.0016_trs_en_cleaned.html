Bradley Wentworth Films, Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd, Potomac, MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: November 30 The first train left (for Estonia). I was at the station. The sight was terrible. Krikhsitzyokyotzo Street was full of men, bundles, little children. The men had control of themselves, they faces were frozen.</p><p>No tears! And the transports arrived, one after anoth- er. The men went up on the transports, lifted their belongings, gave one last glance at the ghetto, and the transport moved. Then they began to wave their hats, their handkerchiefs, whatever they had. That's how the men were uprooted from life, as if they were entering the gates of death, still with hope in their hearts.</p><p>December 24 A quiet Christmas Eve. The ground is decorated with a white cloak. The stars are smiling looking down at the decorated earth. But the green fir tree with its golden decorations, which peeps out of every window, pains my heart the most. This is their holiday not ours. It is their Jesus who was born, and our Jesus yet to be born. They didn't establish God's ten com- mandments; they don't love their brothers as them- selves. They murder them! You are happy with Jesus on account of the holiday, on account of your brandy, but you don't observe the commandments. You do not love your Jesus and he curses you. We also curse you. "Let you be damned forever." Linkova Street and the Old City quarters were cut off from the ghetto. All the people went to live in our neighborhood. And many people are leaving the ghetto.</p><p>I am seriously thinking about trying to get away.</p><p>January 1, 1944 January 1, a new page in the life of the Jews. The morning burst forth of the new year.</p><p>In the pages of history, the year 1943 will be desig- nated as a period of the cruelest blood-letting of the Jewish people. There is so much evil! There were Aktions against Vilna. Hey, tell me. What did you do to the Geist family? And what about the people who were taken to Keiden? Answer me. And when they sold the Russian children? And when they cut apart fami- lies? And the black cloud and the terror of the con- centration camp? And the day of October 26th. Three thousand souls ripped away from their families and brothers and sent to the land of Estonia! And the orphans!

Children shield their chicks with their bodies and guard over them, but Jewish mothers are forced to deliver their children, and to see how they are thrown into a truck.</p><p>But there were heroic mothers, that strangled their children with their own hands! The mothers ordered the Germans to kill them first and only from their corpses could the Germans take their children. Eternal honor to these mothers! And the sons?

Those whom the calamity did not affect stay quiet, and those who had their heart wrenched out -- will the wound scab over from sorrow? No, it will not scab over. The full do not understand the hungry. The Ghetto does not promise us anything good. Anyone who can already escapes.

The sun fell on the earth.</p><p>The life of the young springtime was extinguished.</p><p>Yellow leaves are under the feet. The view changed.</p><p>Men died. The Ghetto which was drowned in flames, left footprints that destroy wisdom. No house was left. In place of where they stood tall and proud, there are only darkened gloomy chimneys facing the heavens; witness that this place -- is a graveyard. They extend across the sky, as if they are pleading for the heavens to revenge the injustice that was done. We are now free. It is now five months since the handcuffs have been removed from my hands.

And I go to become comforted with them... Do you hear me, oak trees? Am I lucky? No I don't consider myself lucky. One after the other images hover across my eyes: Images of the happy, recent past.
