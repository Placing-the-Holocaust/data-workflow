<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: D-e-z-s-o, with two dots on the O. That's a real Hungarian spelling, it's a real</p><p> Hungarian name. The family name was Wieisz and after the war, in 1948, they</p><p> changed the family name to Varga, because of the situation in Hungary at the time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And how can you s -- how do you spell that?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I believe it happened after I left from home, and I left the end of "46, so the year</p><p> it happened, probably the beginning of "48.</p></p></dialogue>

And my mother was born in Ungvar, and my father was born in a small town named Boatfaller. They were -- well, what's the word I want to use? My father was quite a few years older than my mother and he waited until she grew up for them to get married.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How much age difference?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: About eight years, probably. And -- and by that time my father lived in a different city in -- more in the middle of the hung -- eastern part of Hungary, that's where I was born, called Debrecen. And he was a well established businessman at that time. And my mother was a very beautiful woman and they were a very handsome couple. I had three sisters; there was four children in the family, all girls.</p><p>And I lived a nice life.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell me about your sisters, their names.</p></p></dialogue>

Well, our situation was a little bit different than my husband.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I understand.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So we all survived together, we were all together all through that year.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And what has happened to your sisters?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They are fine, we all survived. One sister lives in New York. One lives in Scotland and the youngest one stayed home -- home in Hungary to take care of our parents. See, the other two sisters, the two middle girls left Hungary in 1956, after - - during and after the revolution that they had in Hungary then. And one ended up in England and the other one made it to the United States.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you're the only one that left right away?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, we'll get to that, cause that's much of what we want to talk about. Were you poor, middle class, well-to-do?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, it went from good to bad. When I was born my father was -- we weren't rich, but well-to-do. And what I remember as a child growing up is hearing about things. When the crash of the stock market in the United States and the [indecipherable] got over to Europe by the mid 30's, it had an effect on my father's business. And then eventually, in 1938, Hitler was in power and that was getting downhill. And by 1942 my father was in a labor camp.</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Somehow they were always old. My pare -- my mother's parents and my grandfather had a business, he was a well-to-do man. They lived in a beautiful home.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: He was a what?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: A well-to-do man. He -- they lived in a beautiful home, and I can still remember [indecipherable] built into the mountain there. And they had the business on the bottom of the -- you know, the street floor and the house was up on top, and it was a beautiful home with beautiful furniture and all that. We used to go there to visit and spent -- I spent a lot of vacation time over there. My grandmother was a beautiful woman, a very stately lady. And my grandfather was a sweet old man.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And on the other side?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: On the other side they were -- well, it's a strange stories because my two grandparents -- my two grandmothers were sisters. My parents were first cousins.</p><p>My father's father, he was a different kind of a man, he was -- I don't know how to describe him. I just remember him during the hun -- you know, Jewish holidays.</p><p>He was a religious man, not overly, but he was you know, the both sides were very observant Jewish people. I remember my father's father during the -- the Succoth holiday. And they always had a sukkah built in the yard, and he would sit there and This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Yet, when he got angry, he could yell like -- and scream like a real Hungarian. He had a good temper.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And you had said in the interview that I saw that your -- your father was able to trace your ancestors in Hungary back to the early --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, when the troubles -- the -- yes --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- 1700's.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- when the troubles started in the 30's, you had to trace your ancestry back as far as you could go, because by 1938 - deg39, they were picking up people who were not so-called Hungarians. See, by that time we had a lot of people coming from Slovakia, from Poland, from other countries to Hungary, and they were mostly, I suppose at that time looking for those people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Little did we know that nothing is going to help. And yes, my father did trace our ancestry back into Hungary to the 1700's. On paper.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I want to jump around a little bit, cause again we're filling in little gaps in the previous interview. You went to a Catholic school when it's --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: High school.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: High school, 1939. I'm curious, you had gone to Jewish schools prior to that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Why not a Jewish high school? How did you end up there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So it was --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And this was a specialized school, and unfortunately only the Catholic school</p><p> system had it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Specialized in what way?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It's more of an art oriented high school.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you were gifted in art?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Sort of.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I understand you still --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was where we learned dress designing, tailoring, sewing, drawing, and all</p><p> associated with the arts.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Te-Tell me about friendships that you had in high school, both with Jewish girls</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> and non-Jewish girls, if in fact you did have friendships with non-Jewish girls.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Actually, well we had quite a few Jewish girls going to that same school where</p><p> I went. I don't mean too many, but you know, those were very small classes</p><p> actually, so they had maybe I don't know whether -- the first year I think maybe</p><p> we had about 10 Jewish girls, and after that they sort of left. They're maybe were</p><p> two or three of them left altogether in the class, and -- but as far as non-Jewish</p><p> girls, other than being in the school with them no, I don't think I was really</p><p> friendly with any of them. That were strange over there, see, because we grew up This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

We only wil -- saw Jewish kids. So by the time you were a teenager in your late teens in high school it's -- we were friendly but we were never really so-called friends.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was that by choice or by official design that you'd -- you stayed amongst yourselves?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't think it was a [indecipherable] really, it just the way it worked out.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Would you -- how would you -- I'm thinking in terms of many American cities where blacks live on one side of town and whites live on another side of town, where -- whereas there might not at this time be a legal reason why they can't live together, they often don't, and I'm wondering was it a similar situation or was it --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, no, no. There was one area where most -- were more dominated by Jewish people, mostly by the real Orthodox and the Hassidic type of Jews, but other than that, no. There was no area where you had to live.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That was my question.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no, no, no, no, no.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Cause I know in some cities in Europe there had been the remnants of ghettoes from previous eras.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Shtetl, yes --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right.</p><p>This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

I never lived in a shtetl, no.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's what I was trying to establish.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: At least not in my time in Hungary, no.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay. So you did not have friends with non-Jewish kids that you were clo --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Not close friends, no. But by the time I got to that high school, it was already troubled times. Hitler was already on the horizons and as sweet as the nuns were -- there were a couple of them who were wonderful, and I really think of them highly forever, because they were nice human beings. But then there were others who just as soon would have hand me over to the first Nazi who came about.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell me about them. What -- what memories do you have of these nuns that you got that feeling about?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I remember especially the one nun -- you know, it -- I mean, you go to a Catholic school and there's -- during the time you go and you have to say some kind of a prayer, at least in those days they did, and I remember at one time this particular nun came up to me and said, you better go down on your knee and pray because what's happening out in the world. And in those days a lot of Jewish people did convert to Catholicism and -- hoping it will save them, but nothing did.</p><p>Nothing did because you not only had to prove that you lived in Hungary centuries back -- you also had to prove that you were not Jewish centuries back, so it didn't help. I remember when we were in the wagon already, there was a young woman This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Her parents converted during the first World War or right after, so she was born, you know, as Christian. And yet she was considered a Jew.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: This -- so this nun that told you you better get on your knees, wa -- I'm unclear, was she saying that with malice or with concern?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I think it was malice and no concern, because if it would have been concern, I probably wouldn't remember it the way I do.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: What about the other kids? You intimated in your previous interview that you had experienced some -- some anti-Semitic --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, while we were in the class it was fine, there was no problem. Well, the thing I mentioned then, I believe it was that when we were being marched from the ghetto to the brick factory, there was one of the girls that I went to school with and I used to walk with her home from school, and she thought of nothing picking up a stone and throw it at me. See, people -- we were walking in the middle of the road and the people were standing on both sides on the sidewalk and watching us leaving town.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But back when you were going to school, what did you experience in terms of any -- or did you -- any problems with any of the other Gentile girls?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I don't remember any, really.</p><p>This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Let's talk about the conditions of your deportation from your hometown.</p><p>W -- How did that come about? You -- you rushed through it a little bit in your previous interview. I mean, how did you find out that it was going to happen and what -- could you tell us, sort of take us through from when you found out that it was going to happen til when you were actually --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: [indecipherable] okay, let me go back to the Jewish school, 1938, when our principal came into the class -- well, I guess he went to every class, to tell us what's happening in the world and what we may accep -- expect. And he had -- a big guy, and he had tears in his eye -- his eyes as he was talking to us. That was 1938, and I think s -- well, at first -- after that it was getting harder to hold a job if you were a Jew. I remember in 1939 it was when my father lost his job, he was a -- a district manager for a -- a farm machinery company, and he lost his job because he was a Jew. And then 1942 -- well, in 1939, when Hitler gave back the northern part of Hungary that belonged to Czechoslovakia, and that time to Hungary. And my father was in a uniform, the Hungarian army's uniform. He fought in the first World War, so he was called up again to pay the country back. And by 1941 he was called into labor camp, "41 - deg42 then they let him out for awhile and then they -- took him back again. In 1944, March 19", it was on a Sunday afternoon when the Germans -- German army flew over Hungary. I can still see it, it was a dreary, nasty day. No sunshine at all, and I guess it was foreboding of what was coming.</p><p>This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

They came in on the 19". By April fifth we had to put on the Jewish star. May sixth we were put into the ghetto. I was watching them building the six foot high wall all around the area. In my town, in Debrecen, they had to make two different ghettos because there was a main road going to the railroad station which they couldn't cut off. So there was a smaller side where we lived and there was a larger side on the other side. So our house happened to be in the smaller area, so that's where we were. And to the day the wall was finished we did not believe it, that it will happen. It was impossible, we lived there forever. I was born there, I grew up there. People were hoping that the mayor of the city, little did they know that he had no say so, won't let it happen. But at any rate, May 6, 1944, we were locked into the ghetto. And in June --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: [hate -- I hate to say it, we are going to need to do something about the phone.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, the only thing you can do is just take it off.</p></p></dialogue>

And then we knew. I mean ho-how long can you stay stupid, right? I mean, you had to know something was happening. My father wasn't home and there we were, my mother and the four of us and a -- a little cousin of mine, my mother's nephew, her sister's son who came with us to live. And that's it. We started to pack whatever we could and by noon people were coming into the house to make sure that we're not taking anything valuable with us. So much so that there were two guys and one woman who came to the house, and the woman took my mother into the bedroom to check her inside, literally, her inside, to make sure that she is not hiding anything in her body that's valuable. And the afternoon we were over at the other side. And that was that. That was Sunday afternoon and then, for a strange reason, luckily, they brought my father back with a bunch of other people in his group. So at that point in time we were all together. My family and a -- a brother of my mother -- father and her -- his sister.

Not long, maybe a few days, I'm not -- I don't remember exactly what it was, four or five days maybe. And they were -- that's when we were walking to the brick factory. And we stayed there for about a week or so, and that was a horror. That was absolute horror. We had to get into groups every day and walk down to the railroad tracks and wait in case we were going to be taken someplace. We didn't know where, but we were going to be taken someplace. And then they started to group people together, and we ended up in a group, they had many children in the families. And I think I was the fifth or sixth there and finally they put us into the wagons and we started off. We went to the border of Hungary and Slovakia and I remember there was one of the Hungarian gendars who was on the -- standing on the back of the train. I guess, now in looking back I think the wagons, the car we were in, the cattle car we were in must have been the last one. Either that or each one of them had one of those guys standing there, traveling with us. And that guy, I remember when it -- they start the train and he said to us, that's as far as I can go with you. God be with you.</p></p></dialogue>

And that was that and I remember at that point I had the feeling that this is it, you know, all of a sudden it just hit that I'll probably never get out of the cattle car alive. And some miracle happened, for some reason we stayed there overnight and the train didn't move and th -- early in the morning it started to roll again and we were looking through the cracks which way we're going and we were going back into Hungary, we were in the middle of Hungary.</p><p>Next we knew we start to now s -- go to Budapest.

He wrote a book called, "The Genocide of the Hungarian Jews." You may have heard of it. And he found out that at that point, where we were supposed to be crossing into Poland -- now we were told at the time they couldn't take us through because they bombed the viaduct and the [indecipherable] the train couldn't get through. But what he found out was that there was a group of people who made a deal with the Germans to be taken out of Hungary from Budapest, or wherever, from all over the country. And somebody made a mistake who was directing the -- the cattle cars, and by the time they realized that they took those people on the way to Auschwitz and called This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

To the very last day we were hoping and praying that Mr. Roosevelt will come and save us. Well, Mr. Roosevelt didn't come to save us. As wonderful a man as he was, but that he didn't do. We knew there was trouble, because by 1940 - 41, many, many, many Slovakian Jewish people were in Hungary. They all were running away from Slovakia, only to be caught in Hungary.</p></p></dialogue>

And they were trying to find out who I was and what does a young girl do on a boat like this all by herself and where I came from and where I'm going and they tried to talk to me and up until that point I thought I could speak English.</p><p>Well, when I heard them talk, forget it. I didn't understand almost [indecipherable] what they're saying. So I found out eventually that they were from Brooklyn visiting Europe and coming back from Europe and they were very sweet people, they took me under their arm. When they found out I was from Hungary, they went all over the boat searching for a person, another person from Hungary I can be with through the trip so I won't be lost.

This is tape number two, side A. I was just asking you, cause I've heard from -- from other survivors who felt very leery to be around Gentiles when they -- when the war was over because they had been turned on by all the Gentiles in their life prior to that and -- and so they had a hard time trusting that it wouldn't happen again. And so that's why I asked the question.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I don't know, maybe I'm different, but I never really had too many chances to be with Gentiles, because when we got to Paris, I had some friends already there from home whom I met, they were all Jewish people, young -- young people. So I had no reason to get friendly or get close to any of the Gentiles. And when I got to the United States my family didn't -- weren't friends with any Gentiles.

Porcelain art is what it is. And in those days before the second World War, this was a beautiful profession. And my family had a very good friend who did that, and then when -- when I became a teenager, I took lessons, not from the family friend, but from another young woman, who did some beautiful, beautiful work. And it was just in the early 40's, so we really didn't have much time, but we were hoping, before we knew what was going to happen to us, that someday we gonna come to the United States and bring our beautiful painted porcelain. Well, it didn't happen. Somebody else [indecipherable] otherwise. So then when I came to this country -- see, if I would have ended up -- if my family would have lived in Syracuse, New York, you know, I could have been painting china for 50 years.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: She -- well, she was a very cute, dainty little girl when she was small and I took her to ballet classes.

And the older kids took wer -- when we were in Michigan City were in the children's theater group, and they did great over there. And -- but she was too young for that yet, the little one.

She said, he told me that it's too bad I wasn't in Germany during the war because then Hitler could have killed me too.

Maybe you ought to come and hear what the kids have to ask and you talk to them. And that's when, you know, we really started to talk about it to other than us.

And then in the spring my parents wanted to send the child back to her, and my father almost found somebody who was going there with her -- with his daughter and at first they agreed that okay, they're going to take a chance and take the child back. In the last minute they said no, we're afraid to take a child because if they find out you're taking a Jewish child, we get in trouble too, so they didn't take him. And as it happened, he survived, today he is a doctor and he lives in Texas, and his mother and sister is gone and we don't know how and -- but they died in Auschwitz, both of them.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes. We were in Germany a few ye-years ago, my husband was testifying against some Nazi people from the camp. We met some lovely German people, they didn't know what to do for us. As a matter of fact we became friends. And she practically saved my life while we were there because I became sick over there and she had a friend who was a doctor and you know, she -- she took care of me. So --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Are you aware -- I'm assuming you are, of the -- how the American Jews reacted to what was going on and what they did and didn't do?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They didn't do a whole lot either, did they?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I was wondering how you felt when you learned that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Disappointed I suppose, but then I don't think it would have make any difference, because even though this is a free country, it's still the government that decides. It's Washington who makes the decisions.

It said no dogs -- I'm trying to remember exactly how it was worded. No dogs, no Jews and no blacks allowed in the building. That was in 1947. And I turned to my aunt and I asked, how could you stand for this? To me it was outrageous. But that took me awhile to -- like all of us who come to this country, you know, from somewhere else and this is a whole different life, and to get to know it, where it came from and what it's all about. No, it's not fair, it's not fair to treat anybody like that, regardless of color.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I guess I was wondering if you felt any particular affinity or connection of -- watching the way they were treated, versus how you were treated.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Connection, no, not really, because it's two different things altogether. No, it's - - it's not the same thing, and you can't really bring it to the same level.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I guess what I'm wondering is, when you, over the years have learned about something horrible that's in the midst of happening, like in Rwanda all the -- they were both, you know, massacring left and right the -- you know, the -- the two ethnic groups there.
