<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: This was -- yes. Well, it was damaged during the uprising, but still, the structure is there.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I would say it's close to center, yes, close to center, because the Royal Tr-Track starts from Wilan6ew, all the way to the old town in Warsaw, but this is part of that section that covers that distance.

But Nowy Swiat, the New World, actually started from that square, Three Crosses Square.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Thaddeus Gubala deg January 27, 2015</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay. What kind of a building did you grow up in? Was it a huge apartment building, or single family --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, it was in an apart -- it was about five story building, five story building, yes.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, it was a modern place. Warsaw is a -- as it grew, during the time after the first World War, this was under the Tsarist Russia.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But then, when Pilsudski came to power in 1918, Poland regained her independence, after 123 years of nonexistence, so to speak, of -- Poland only existed only as partitions.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Poland was divided actually into three segments, and this was Prussian, Russian, and Austro-Hungary. So actually, Warsaw was part of the Tsarist domain.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="2"></span>  Interview with Thaddeus Gubala deg January 27, 2015</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So, when Poland became independent again, and the three parts became united, 123 years is still quite a while, because it is more than living memory. Several generations are comprised in that. Had people changed very much? Could you understand one another -- I mean psychologically?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, there were different, let's say, frames that the Poles grew, that say, Germans were very anti-Polish, and Hakatay(ph) was the organization that even forbade the Polish language to be used at schools.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Russians were also trying to bring their influence to the point. And then, the most tolerant part was the au -- aus -- aus -- aus --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Austro-Hungarian?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Aust-Austro-Hungarian part. Yeah, so that was was a -- a little better for schooling, secondary schooling and so on. And let's say Poles from Galicia?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You know, they were a little different in character than let's say, Poles that were slightly Germanized under the ger -- the Prussian operation, and the Poles living under the Russians. So, this process of fusing us together was actually a great, let's say, accomplishment of the Catholic church, because they mostly -- the Poles were of Catholic faith, and that was -- the church was actually the strongest party that  <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Thaddeus Gubala " January 27, 2015 existed in -- in Poland. But then when Pilsudski became the Marshall of Poland -- this was in 1914, and officially Poland regained her independence in the 18, he was assigned a task of, let's say, fusing th-the different characters of people that grew in different segments of the country.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So what were some of the -- I mean, just curiosity -- you say the Galicianas are different than those who were -- and Galicia was under Austro-Hungarian rule?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What kind of character did the one have in comparison to the other two, and so on?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Let's say the -- the -- let's say the Germans, Poles, from the German part, from the Prussian part were, let's say, a little bit more like Germans, very orderly, let's say the work that they accomplished was more thorough than let's say the group of Poles in the east, under the Russians. And let's say the Galicians were also a little bit closer to -- to -- to -- to German influence. But all together, united by the faith, you know, we were very quickly re -- reburn(ph).</p></p></dialogue>

Did they ha -- did -- were cars -- automobiles common to see? Well, in the center of Warsaw, I would assume that these things --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, the Poland was called -- they called Poland at that time -- the Warsaw was the -- the -- the Paris of the east.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: That was -- city was about one point two million people. And there -- there was, let's see, very large Jewish diaspora in Warsaw. The diaspora was about 400,00, so every third Warsawian was of -- of Hebrew faith. Some of them got more or less Poland-ized, then the -- they were, let's say, getting with the Poles closer, and the other ones were dep -- Poland was free, as far as the religion is concerned, so they had their ow-own synagogues, they had their own traditions, and they grew in the environment that their predecessors are sort of giving them. But --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did you -- mm-hm, go ahead.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And Warsaw -- Warsaw was specially -- some districts of Warsaw were predominantly Jewish.

And I think the -- the help came from the good, old U.S.A., you know, so -- and then fa -- I think contribution was also made by the Polish president to build in the area where they have nalewki(ph), and that was that infamous Umschlagplatz. That's was the -- the Jews were loaded on the trucks, and taken over to Treblinka. So this was ex-Jewish district.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, was the Umschlagplatz within the space of the ghetto, or outside of it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Umschlagplatz was on the periphery of ghetto, you know, but it was inside, inside yes.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So when -- when -- when Jews were being loaded onto -- you'd say trucks, and then to trains, or how would they be --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, they were -- they were -- they were walking toward the tra-- Umschlagplatz.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They were streetcars, but they were not used.

This bridge I remember well, and that portion of wall, and the main gate to the ghetto, I remember very well because my school was like -- during the occupation, you know, the secondary schooling was forbidden for the Poles.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>

We could buy some good material for our, let's say weapons, even pistols and so on. So when I was arrested by the Germans, I was young -- 12 years -- or 12 - 13 years old, and they put me in the prison on  <span class="page-break" number="20"></span> ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion Interview with Thaddeus Gubala 4 January 27, 2015 Poznanska Street, and I -- they kept me there -- because Germans actually gave to the blue policeman.

And they gave me, as a youngster to the blue policemen, and they put me in jail. So I spend there a few weeks, and what happened is that I-- I was young, undernourished, and I had some beginning of tuberculosis.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. So there are many reasons to try and catch it, not only for the person themselves, but so that it wouldn't become infectious and an epi -- an epidemic.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, yes. No, the -- the -- it was very close to epidemic, because we were receiving about 1500 calories, and that was not enough to -- to -- to die, and not enough to live normal life.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: With Germany.

Because now -- it -- there is a certain similarity what they doing now in Ukraine, you know, when they coming to protect their brothers and sisters, living in the administrative territory of eastern Ukraine, that was happening in the eastern part of Poland. They came to resc -- rescue the Ukrainians minority that lived there, and the Byelorussian minority, and all the part of north -- northeast part of Poland that's Lithuania nowadays.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. Nervousness. Nervousness was a controlled -- a very rude way by the Germans. At the beginning -- that was -- I'm speaking of 1940, very rough winter in Warsaw, because it was very cold, and then "42 -- 42, "41 -- 42, when the separation of the population was getting to the point that they build the ghetto, and they separated Aryan population from the Jewish population. And then "43, the conditions started changing where that German behavior, after Korksk(ph) and Stalingrad changed their attitude. They sort of mellowed down, you know, that's -- that greeting of high Hitler, with the hand raised very high, changed a little bit like, just in case we lose, high Hitler with the little -- smaller -- smaller gesture. We were laughing, and -- but we sensed that was a city that was witnessing the change in the German attitude.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The Polish army.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Polish army, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Okay, now I want to turn to another subject; again, before the war. What were the kinds of conversations that you would have around the dinner table with your family? Did you talk about political events, and political things?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Say Poles all together, they have, let's say, great interest in -- in politics. And especially since Poland was exposed to all different, let's say pressures from the west, from the east. Discussions at the table, and friends of my father came over.</p><p>They were officers from the -- active officers from the -- from the Polish army. They discuss at the table the issues of Poland being such a strong country, that they -- the Germans will attack Poland, we will resist, and then so on, and so on. So the talks were on the subject of military efforts, and -- an-and Europe at that time was sort of sensing oncoming second World War. So these discussions, I remember that the father was discussing this. But when we had gatherings that my mother's brother coming from Otwock for -- sometimes for a weekends, or summertime, so we were going there, discussions were different, you know. Our schooling time, and then  <span class="page-break" number="37"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Thaddeus Gubala * January 27, 2015 changes in the economy that were improving little by little; because you know, country was actually devastated during the first World War, and the oppressors, the occupiers, they -- they were taking their share. So we could not develop, just like western Europe developed free, and that momentum that they had could not be, let's say, shown in the Polish economy.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, here's a question that's a bit provocative, and I know in advance that it is.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>But there is the image, that when the war started, and Germany crossed the border into Poland with tanks, they were met by cavalry officers on horses and swords.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: This is -- actually, this was a false story. Some of the big cavalry units were surrounded by the German, let's say motorized units. And when they locked in, they tried to escape, but they were not, let's say, crazy enough to attack with the lances against the German tanks, no.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. I mean -- I-I mean more that Poland was so unprepared that it didn't have tanks of its own, that it didn't have modern military equipment. Is that so, or is that a falsehood?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's falsehood. We had air force.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's a-- not as modern as the Germans had, but very effective.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="38"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Thaddeus Gubala deg January 27, 2015</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We had our own design, let's say WSK Kalisz and that PZL-11. These airplanes were not large in numbers, because this was a developing industry in Poland, the aircraft industry. The tanks, they were not built in Poland, but we had tanks vic -- Vickers tanks from -- imported from England. And we had the motorized units. We had the motorized brigade that actually later on, became the first armored division in the west, under General Maczek, af you -- if you heard.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh. Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And when -- when Poland army was formed, let's say we had so much experience with the enemies that the army was indoctrinated well enough to be spiritually strong. Equipment-wise, we were inferiors to Germans. We were inferiors -- spirit of fighting was much stronger maybe that the Germans had.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So the morale was high.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Morality of the army was high, morale was high, but the equipment was inferior, inferior. But very effective. Because remember, when the -- when the Germans attacked us from three directions, actually; from East Prussia, going south; from the Reich, they were going east, and from the south, they were attacked through -- Czechoslovakia was already annexed by the -- by the Reich, by the Germany.</p></p></dialogue>

So we had some -- part of the invasion of ch -- Slovaks into Poland, the German armies, and then armies from the East Prussia that was coming in.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And that was all September 1*, 1939?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, September 1939. So, wi-- most of our defenses were directed against the Germans coming from the west. We did not expect the Russians will stab us in the back on the 17" of September. They attacked to come and free their people that were living in Kresy, which was the Volhynia, Polesie, Podole, and the Nowogrodek, closer to Lithuania, as we were. So Kresy were liberated, quotation marks, by the -- by the Russians.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay. But then --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And these were prior to the -- prior to the outbreak of the war.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- going on, I don't know if you see it. I didn't see it, but I would like to see it, because there was a great contribution to the victory of the allied effort during the second World War, by giving the -- giving the English and French the secrets of enigma. What was started was the getting in, was the mathematical school that the Poles attended in 1932. And the connections that the Germany had with East Prussia was via the enigma. They were sending codes, and all different secret  <span class="page-break" number="41"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Thaddeus Gubala * January 27, 2015 information. So the Poles started getting interest in it, and Zygalski, Rafski(ph), and there was a third name that I forgot, but the -- these were the three codebreakers, later on that they work for the Polish secret service. And this was in July 1939, when from England, Poland signed the agreement to be defended by England and France, in case that we get attacked by the Germans. But anyway, going back to that point that the British paid a visit to Poland, Pery(ph) was the name of the town in the suburb of Warsaw. Poles had copied two machines that were intercepted.</p><p>When they send this to East Prussia, it went via Warsaw. So the secret service took the machines, dismembered them, photographed them, do everything possible to reproduce the machines. And some of the copies were so identical that the Germans wouldn't be able to recognize which is the original, which is the copy.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, so then you started fueling disinformation?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, so when they came over, the British, Knox and Denniston, | think, they were two gentlemen, and the Frenchman, Bernard, Colonel Bernard came over, and they were actually exchanging their accomplishment that field of cryptology, with the Poles. And they were very surprised when the Poles simply showed them that, we have two gifts from you. One machine for the British, M -- M -- MI-6, I believe, and the French secret -- military secret to Colonel Bernard.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see. Okay, this shows how much you know about -- I mean, very few people know the detail of this -- these sorts of events. But when I asked of the Molotov- Ribbentrop Pact, and did people know about it, I-- I need to be more precise. Did the man on the street know about it, or did the government know about it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I'd say, speaking of government, Polish government, when Poland was attacked, escaped, with a lot of trained personnel; most of the Polish airmen went through Romania -- Romania was ally of Poland -- and most of them escaped through Hungary and Romania to the west.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So when the government left Poland, ji-- was General Rydz-Smigly, and MoScicki was the president. Moscicki was actually a -- as --a Swiss. He was educated in Switzerland and so on. But anyway, when they left, the official, legal Polish government was formed in France.

The Messerschmitts were much faster, and they were metal planes.

The anti-aircraft -- actually, there was a heavy machine gun position near that Clement's church, in their garden, you know, they set up near the church, because you know, the religious Germans would not maybe mount an attack somewhat close to the church. But this -- this post was manned by the -- by the Polish army, and the anti-aircraft was very effective.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, in other words, did they become -- did they set up the training for the RAF pilots, and for Polish pilots over -- over Germany?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The RAF, yes, that was the -- Doening(ph), General Doening(ph), the head of the RAF. He was very skeptical, because there was a language barrier, and actually, he finally, when he saw what the damages the Luftwaffe did to the British, he decided to accept the Polish contingent of air pilots, and there were two squadrons formed. Three or two, and three or through -- three. Kosciuszko Squadron. I even have a poster that I can later on show you. These pilots -- if you saw a movie, "Battle of Britain," there were Poles, very brave, and we had the highest score, beating the Germans on equal basis, you know, because Spitfires and Hurricanes were equivalent to Messerschmitts. Or Dornier, or whatever they had, the bombing airplanes, the Heinkels and Dorniers, and all the weapons that Goering provided for -- for the Operation Sea Lion, whatever it was, he wanted to put Britain on the -- on her knees. And the fight was very, let's say, effective. So the pilots, the pilots that left Poland, they put their talent to action in England, when they had better airplanes, but the spirit very strong. The -- the British were a little skeptical, because of the language, and we were not so very obedient. We had our  <span class="page-break" number="48"></span> Interview with Thaddeus Gubala * January 27, 2015</p><p> style of fighting in the sky, and the guys really, when they attacked, th-th-the British squadron leader at that time, there was a Canadian by the name of Kent. He was trying to control the disobedience of Pole, how to attack the Germans, but the results were rather -- very effective.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The 303 was the Kosciuszko Squadron.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Substitute. Ersatz. That's a -- the bread, the basic stuff, staple. The marmalade was made out of beets, sweetened up with saccharin. You know, it was the artificial sweetener. And that thing, you could eat as much as you wanted, but the next day the thing was fermented and was growing. You always had a full -- full jar. So meat was only on the black market -- black market, you know, so the ingenious Poles were going to the countryside to bring food. The Germans intercepted -- most of the railroad stations they were intercepting in order to take that food away from them.</p><p>But food; meat, butter, you know, these were things very difficult to obtain.</p></p></dialogue>

But eggs you could buy on the bla -- black market; flour and butter, you know. Whatever the people could smuggle in from the countryside, that was done.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, many a times said now, we are experiencing this unfortunate exchange of thoughts that we had just before the war started. Because the occupation was cruel, very cruel. And we were treated as sub-humans.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Like for instance, if you went for the black market to buy food in the country.</p><p>The farmers used to accept only the pre-war money, which was silver coins.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did your father ever t-tell stories of what he would see at the Ostbahn? What kind of things he would be translating?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: When -- he often told me about the German trains coming from the eastern front.</p><p>He said that he saw some kwerp -- corpses. I mean, the people without legs, you know, frozen noses, ears. But they were running through the tracks that were separated by some kind of partition, so the civilians wouldn't see them. But he said that casualties were coming from the eastern front, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So he could see these things and he talked about them?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>

Is this where his translation skills were used, for them to translate orders? Or was it in different capacities?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He was translating because there were many Poles employed that didn't speak German. But the work assignments that were, let's say, by the Germans to direct certain squads of people to do this kind of work, [indecipherable] repairs, or the -- what they call, the platform repairs, or -- or is -- cleaning up the stations, you know.</p><p>So he was always called in as a interpreter.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I--I don't think so.

He, let's say, cooperated, if there was some assignment to report, yes.</p><p>But I don't think that he was fully sworn in, an-and -- and -- and working for the -- for the underground. Let's say Poles were all members of the underground. We were all, let's say, sympathetic to the people that were actually the activists, you know, and the civilians were cooperating every time there was a situation, a dangerous situation, so they did help.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>

But what we did over first and second of the uprising day, we build a barricade and a deep ditch on Karolkowa Street. So the Germans, when they came over, to the point I saw them, I was reporting down that there is a German armor car waiting, but they hesitating to cross because of the obstacle.

Some of the barracks were marked with the Red Cross sign on top, because of the importance of that railroad junction. So they tried to show the allies up in the air, don't bomb, because this is a hospital, or whatever they thought for a moment. But we were put on these ramps, and we worked hard for a bowl of soup --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So was your --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- piece of bread.</p></p></dialogue>

There was a bunker, there was a bunker in the middle of the station that looked like a innocent building like, but the walls were about a yard thick. During the unexpected alerts, when the big boys were  <span class="page-break" number="145"></span>  149 Interview with Thaddeus Gubala January 27, 2015 coming over, and they were coming over by numbers, Americans were flying these fortresses, you know, that you would pray more and more, please.</p></p></dialogue>

So some of the prisoners of war that signed the agreement that they would like to work for the -- you know, as civilians, they were there. So they put us in the very top. We used to sing songs, and all the things that the Germans were getting so aggravated, you know, because we were happy when the bombing was going on. Praying more and more. That was one scene. Another  <span class="page-break" number="146"></span> </p><p> 150 Interview with Thaddeus Gubala January 27, 2015 scene was that th -- there were transports of cattle.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh my goodness.</p></p></dialogue>
