They discuss at the table the issues of Poland being such a strong country, that they -- the Germans will attack Poland, we will resist, and then so on, and so on. So the talks were on the subject of military efforts, and -- an-and Europe at that time was sort of sensing oncoming second World War. So these discussions, I remember that the father was discussing this.

So we could not develop, just like western Europe developed free, and that momentum that they had could not be, let's say, shown in the Polish economy.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, here's a question that's a bit provocative, and I know in advance that it is.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>But there is the image, that when the war started, and Germany crossed the border into Poland with tanks, they were met by cavalry officers on horses and swords.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: This is -- actually, this was a false story. Some of the big cavalry units were surrounded by the German, let's say motorized units.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. I mean -- I-I mean more that Poland was so unprepared that it didn't have tanks of its own, that it didn't have modern military equipment. Is that so, or is that a falsehood?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's falsehood. We had air force.</p></p></dialogue>

These airplanes were not large in numbers, because this was a developing industry in Poland, the aircraft industry. The tanks, they were not built in Poland, but we had tanks vic -- Vickers tanks from -- imported from England. And we had the motorized units. We had the motorized brigade that actually later on, became the first armored division in the west, under General Maczek, af you -- if you heard.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh. Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And when -- when Poland army was formed, let's say we had so much experience with the enemies that the army was indoctrinated well enough to be spiritually strong. Equipment-wise, we were inferiors to Germans. We were inferiors -- spirit of fighting was much stronger maybe that the Germans had.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So the morale was high.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Morality of the army was high, morale was high, but the equipment was inferior, inferior. But very effective.

And this was in July 1939, when from England, Poland signed the agreement to be defended by England and France, in case that we get attacked by the Germans.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The food was actually for us, for the Poles. That was not for the production, for the Germans, was strictly controlled by -- by the Germans, you know, so they -- they were very careful.

He, let's say, cooperated, if there was some assignment to report, yes.</p><p>But I don't think that he was fully sworn in, an-and -- and -- and working for the -- for the underground. Let's say Poles were all members of the underground. We were all, let's say, sympathetic to the people that were actually the activists, you know, and the civilians were cooperating every time there was a situation, a dangerous situation, so they did help.</p></p></dialogue>
