Unless he -- you know the question.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes. You're asking the question now. Could you ask the question then?</p></p></dialogue>

Then they called the mayor from Vaihingen, the mayor or somebody and the people come over.
