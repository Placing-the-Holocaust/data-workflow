Well, his father had a factory on in Berlin. But he got very old, 76, 78, so he and his brother took over the factory. He was a salesman, traveling all over Deutschland(ph) and even to Switzerland, so forth, selling, and his brother was the inside man, factory, you know, you know, the shoeboots, polish had to be done during the night and daytime it was too warm and too difficult to do. Anyway, they had a big outfit, very well known, shoeboots and Spectrol(ph) , which was very well known. I show you later, an ashtray. And <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> remove it, they left it there and he was very handicapped from that shooting. Always laying down and bah, bah, bah. When he came from the factory she did everything for him, so on and so forth.</p><p>But she didn't like that her brother-in-law, my friend, had an affair with me. And his mother told her once, what don't you like on Rolf? I think he's the most charming fellow, beautiful fellow, what do you want from him? And Emil(ph) is very fond of him. So, but you know in that time, homosexuality in the 20's was like the red cloth to the steer, you know what I mean? So she always, so she said one day, "You go with him." No, "I will arrange an appointment with Dr. Marcus Hirschfeld. He should see you and see whether he can help you to get rid of it." I laughed out loud, didn't say a word and when we were alone, I said to him, "I think she's crazy. She can't, this is not a sickness, what, what does she think that it is?" "But if she you, I tell you what, we are going both to Dr. Marcus Hirschfeld, making an appointment, tell him what we experience with your sister-in-law, that we don't like it, that we are crazy, crazy about things, she doesn't know more" and so on and so forth. And we went to Dr. Marcus Hirschfeld.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can you explain as to who Dr. Marcus Hirschfeld is, in that time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Dr. Marcus Hirschfeld was a man who, in Germany was a law 175, yes the homosexuality law, number 175 and he had a big practice in the . That is like a little Central Park, <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> "What are you laughing mister?" I said, "That's too funny. To put hangers like this in a..."_" Well," he says, "this is our trademark, period." We were besides ourself that's . So then he came in, <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Why was he so known?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because, as I just told you, like here for instance, sex or, it was very open, you know. He had, as I told you, balls on Saturdays, making money and so on and so forth. People come, came from practical all over the world looking for advice from him and he was very, very well known. Very well known. So that made her, I think, she had the idea that he could do something about it. But he, smart man as he was, told her right away, this is not a sickness, there can be nothing done about it, this is something that you're born with, period. And that's why he wrote her the letter on my account. But she was still not 100 percent satisfied, but I didn't care any more because what we did was more than enough, period.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You said that he lived in an institute, in a big villa. What did he do in this institute, exactly, do you know this?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: There were people, how shall I explain it?

Were laying there for one or two months, til they healed and so and that was in 1925, "26, "27, a big affair, very big, very known people, I don't know, at the time being were, couple of them went and got operated on and as I told you before, this side was like a charity and this was a lift and then he was, has a big park and in that park were the parties for 175.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you ever go to one of these parties?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Once I went. And I, I tell you why I went. He and I, we were very, very, how shall we say, careful. He had to be on account of his employers and the factory and I didn't want him to be laughed at or whatever it is, God forbid and so on and so forth, so we were very, very careful. Very seldom. But that time was a masquerade, so nobody would know. He didn't take it, I took a mask out, he didn't, he just went. So I said, "I want to go." "All right, if you want to go, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> , but I don't __.". So what shall I tell you? I went to a very famous masquerade man, who for the theater , I don't know whether that name rings a bell with you. I think he's, not today any more, but he was for a long time very famous. And I went there and I said, "Look, Hirschfeld gives a party, I'd like to, would love to go in a masquerade and then I can have my hat and my face masked and so on, so forth." "Mr. Hirschberg, don't worry.</p><p>Show me your legs." I said, "What are you talking about?" I said, "Show me your legs." I put my</p><p> up. "Oh, we ____, perfect, perfect." I said, "What's perfect?" "You have no bowlegs, that's very good, very important to that costume I want to give you." I said, "What kind of costume do you want to give me?" "You go as a fowl." What do you call it, a fowl, here in English? You know? ?</p></p></dialogue>

My lawyer, unfortunately, he went to Switzerland too, a Jew too and he was, terrible, , young man, 35 years old. Well anyway, so my friend says, "You know what? I think it's the time we are leaving.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Could I, I would like to go a step back and we go back to this boat ina moment. Can you tell us, before we go on, little bit, you were brought up Jewish, can you tell us a little bit how that was before 1933 and how that changed, what was the effect after Hitler's rise to power in 1933?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well of course the, what was that famous night?

"Well my , whatever it is, told me I have to stay here and and what happened in the factory," says Emil. "Nobody here?" "Well there's somebody taking care, your brother __."" And that's where Emil got very upset and very annoyed, of course. And after the Kristallnacht, I went to his house, his parents house and he came to my mother's house and we didn't go out much very much. Sometimes to the theater when we knew that it's safe enough you know ____. Besides, we lived in a circle where you could walk to the, the theater part of the</p><p> . on all the names.

Anyway, the day came, I brought my mother to the , to the house of that rabbi and then Emil said, "You know, just pack a few things, don't make it too obvious." sent them and we went to, as I told you, to Prague. And there, his brother put things together and at that time, when we left, I still could take my things from my apartment. They packed it and sent it to me and he took part, his whole thing in there, from his apartment. So we left as I said, on the 11th of April, 1937, with the Normandy. Our cost 2500 marks, but we didn't do it for ___, we did it because we got the half price in New York, back, if we don't go back on the same. And that's why we like to have some money here, when we come on, you know. I don't, you should have seen that cabin. With green silk, I can't tell you, it was total. But unfortunately, it was such a storm, even the captain go seasick. It was awful. And when we came here, oh yeah, the main thing is, my, I had to go in Berlin, to the military board there because I was still due to serve military. So in the</p><p> I went one moring with my passport and I said, "I want to go to America." Yeah and there was a man like Hindenburg(ph), that fat, big, oh . I thought, oh my God.

They were old people, 80, 90 years old.</p><p>God knows when I ever see them again and so on, so forth. "Are you coming back?" I said, "I certainly do, my mother is here" and so on and so forth. Of course everything was a lie. And he will ask question and question. Finally he took the stamp, put it on my passport and my heart was jumping. But then, I still see him coming around the desk and he said, "Mr. Hirschberg, come back in six months, that paper map hanger will be here any more." The map of the military. But anyway, I knew that I wouldn't come back anyway.

The passport has to be six months later. I thought I'd die.</p><p>Well, I went over, he said, "You want to take a taxi?" I said, "We have," what was that hotel on 58th Street and Central Park West? That guy took it over now, I always forget the name. Anyway, we had rented a room there from Germany for four weeks. I said to them, "If you take me to the hotel, I will pay, but if you take me somewhere else, you have to pay." So &lt;<i "mr.="" and="" can't="" cousin,="" hirschberg,="" i="" morning.="" mr.<="" night="" one="" p="" tell="" the="" through.="" went="" what="" you="" your=""></i></p><p>Kroner(ph), he has a lease for you."

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: 60 years. I would like to ask a couple of questions, but I need to make a big jump backwards for that. Course, we heard a little bit about the friendship and the relationship, but very little so far about growing up Jewish in Germany before 1933. You mentioned that you are Jewish, but how was it growing up Jewish before 1933 in Berlin?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Like everybody else. The religion had to do anything with you or for you or against you. As a matter of fact, they never held my friend or me as a Jew? Why? A Jew hasn't got blue eyes, they have dark eyes and don't have red hair and are not blonde like he was. That was their sign for a Jew, you follow me? So we weren't even kept for Jews to tell you the truth, but even if and when, there was no , nothing doing. I mean there were of course certain things which, take for instance the , they were Jews who came from the, from</p><p> east, with pious long thing. Children run after them. They thought they go to a masquerade. They didn't even know what it is. I saw it once too, didn't believe my eyes.

I said, "Yes, but why do you want see me?" She says, "As I told you before, I'm your godmother, I would love to see you, to know you" and bah, bah, bah. I said, "Where do you live?" "On 72nd Street, between Park and Flexing(ph). Would you like to come tomorrow?" I said, "Not tomorrow." Oh yeah and I forgot, in the meantime, while we were on 46th Street in the school, Emil met a gentleman who has a drugstore in Breslow(ph) in Germany.

Raspberry syrup.</p><p>And he was another one, , was his name? It doesn't matter. Emil said, "Fine, for the time being." And they had, in Brooklyn, a little house and in the cellar, they built these machines and they called it . And I sold and he sold. We went to all the German refugees, we got lists and so on, so forth. And I told her that. No, next morning, I said, "I have no time, I have deliveries." "What do you deliver?" And I told her, "Raspberry syrup." And there was another Jew, Gorman(ph), he made . And this together was a very good combination and my friends called, "Rolfie, bring us orange juice, raspberry syrup and chocolate." Well anyway, I said, "The next morning I can come because then I have to take no deliveries." So I went to her. I come in and she said, "Who do you want?" I said, "Miss Livingston."

On the other hand you had in Berlin, as you told us, many bars for homosexuals, also different kinds of bars. You were in a relationship. So how did you feel as a homosexual in these years before "33 and then between "33 and "37.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Like a stranger, to tell you the truth. Because I was born in Berlin, right? And I was a Berliner.</p><p>But when the Nazi's came you had the feeling you are a stranger, all of a sudden. Why? As I told you my school friend, who I know in his heart he hated the Nazi's, but he put on the Nazi's uniform, comes to a Jews house, surprises me that I nearly got a heart attack when I opened the door and saw him as a Nazi, I said, "Richard, are you crazy? Or do you want to frighten me? Or is that a masquerade?" And then he told me that if he wants to live and if he has to get work, he has to put on the uniform. And I know deep in his heart, I know him so well, that he hated them and I, I don't know what to say, you know? And still he put it on. And in my opinion there were many, many like him. In their heart they hated them, but outside they had to agree. Why? They had to live, period.</p></p></dialogue>
