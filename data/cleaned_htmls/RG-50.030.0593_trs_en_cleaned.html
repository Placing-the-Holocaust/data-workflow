Today is the 15" of October, 2010. I'm here with Erica Kanter, and I am Ann Erling.</p><p>So, let's start. Let's start from the very beginning. Could we get your full name, the name, if it was different at birth, and your birthdate and where you born, please?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. The name is Erica Kanter. The maiden name was Hecht, h-e-c-h-t.</p><p>I was born in Stuttgart, Germany in April 19", 1929.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay, and then just tell me about your childhood; your home and your family, and what -- what life was like?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I lived in Stuttgart. My father was a physician. My father was Jewish, my mother was Catholic, but neither of them really practiced their religion. My father was a very successful physician, so we had a very nice, privileged life. We lived in Stuttgart, which was a very modern city at the time. They had buildings by Gropius, and I had a very privileged childhood. We had live-in helpers who were like family and so my childhood was a very happy childhood.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you have any siblings?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, I have a sister who's five years older than I, here name is -- was Lisalotte(ph), and now is Lisa. And my brother, who's three years older than I,  <span class="page-break" number="0"></span>  Interview with Erica Kanter " October 15, 2010 his name is Karl Theodore, and is now Ted. My sister lives in Los Angeles, my brother lives in Ann Arbor, Michigan.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay, did you -- you attended school in Stuttgart?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, I went to elementary school, and -- for four years, and my teacher, whom I adored, was Fraulein Gruninger(ph). And I went to the Wagenborg(ph) schule and had a very happy early education.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were there both Jewish and non-Jewish children at this school?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, there were all kinds of children, Jewish, Catholic, Protestant. And I have a friendship book in which some of them signed and had their pictures, and they're of all religions.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay, so a lot of your friends were both Jewish and non-Jewish?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. What are some of your earliest childhood memories?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, [have a lot of them, and many of them are in a memoir which I wrote, and was published last year. We were very close to my parents and we did the usual amusements and entertainments for Germans of the time. We went walking a lot, and we went to the puppet theater, and we visited my grandparents, who lived in Ulm. And in the summer, we went to Czechoslovakia, where my maternal grandparents had an estate, which was a castle. And so for the first seven  <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion</p><p> Interview with Erica Kanter deg</p><p> October 15, 2010</p><p> or eight years of my life, I went to Czechoslovakia every summer to spend time at</p><p> the castle. So --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's so cool.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- Thad a very privileged childhood. Nothing but happy childhood.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's so good. So you said that your family didn't really practice religion. Did</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> you do any -- prac -- do any -- I guess, recognize any Jewish holidays or Christian</p><p> holidays?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not really. I-I think even my grandparents, my paternal grandparents, who</p><p> were Jewish, I don't think they practiced their religion either, which was not</p><p> unusual for a lot of German Jews. But I did go to Sunday school. I went to</p><p> German Lutheran Sunday school, and I think I just, you know, went once a week</p><p> and it was just part of my growing up, I guess. And then when I came to the</p><p> United States in 1940, I became a member of the congregational church, which</p><p> apparently is not too dissimilar from the German Lutheran church.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm. Remind me again what year you were born?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Iwas born in 1929.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. So, did you experience any anti-Semitism when you were growing up?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not really. It seems that Stuttgart was rather late in having anti-Semitism</p><p> visible. I did know that -- I think in 1938 perhaps, I was no longer allowed to go to  <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> Interview with Erica Kanter deg October 15, 2010 the swimming pool. But I stayed in school, I think until early in 1939. However, in 1938, my father lost his medical license, and on Kristallnacht he was arrested and he was sent to Dachau. Now, in those days, apparently, you could still get out after a fo -- short period. And he was there for a month, and the requirements for leaving at that time, as far as I know, were that you had already applied for a visa to leave Germany, and that you had served in the German army in World War I.</p><p>And my father was in the German army as a medic in World War I, but he was sent to Dachau. And then, we're not a hundred percent sure if the story is true, but I was told that the police chief in Stuttgart had a six year old son, and my father was the family doctor, and they say that my father saved the child's life. And that when this police chief heard that my father was in Dachau, and had already applied for a visa and had served in the army in World War I, he also helped him.</p><p>So my father got out of Dachau after a month, after he had to have surgery which was caused by his stay in Dachau, where they ruined his sinuses. He left through Switzerland and then went to England. And he came to England in September of 1939. My brother, my sister and I were sent to England in, I think April of 1939, on the Kindertransport.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Well, let's -- let's back up a little fur -- a little bit before we talk about the Kindertransport. Do you remember -- you said you remember not being able to  <span class="page-break" number="3"></span>  Interview with Erica Kanter " October 15, 2010 go to the swimming pool any more. Do you remember anything else happening at -- you know, your father losing his practice, but I mean, did children treat you differently at school?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no. No one treated me differently while I was still in school. My teacher didn't, my friends didn't. So it really didn't affect me too much. And I was probably doing something very silly, I-- my mother did let me have English lessons for a short while. And I remember going on the street and practicing my little English sayings, which of course was not very smart, because if anyone had heard me, there might have been a problem, but fortunately no one ever heard me or paid attention.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you attended school up until you left?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. I think I probably was taken out of school few weeks or months, I really don't remember how long. But I know that my mother had lots of clothes made for me to take to England, and I did have these English lessons, but I don't remember how long I was out of school.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did your family at home, did your parents talk about the Nazi rise to power?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It wasn't a concern?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> Interview with Erica Kanter deg</p><p> October 15, 2010</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, the only thing I remember is that the night my father was arrested, my</p><p> mother woke me up and I remember having to say goodbye to my father, but that's</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How long -- sorry to interrupt --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's all --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- how long was he in Dachau?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: About a month, I think.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay, so when did your parents talk to you about the Kindertransport? When</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> did you know that decision had been made?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't really remember. I don't remember whether my mother ever explained</p><p> it to me. It was through my mother that we were able to get out, because she did</p><p> all this while my father was in Dachau.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So this was in April or May of "39?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think we left in April 1939.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. And then what -- what went into the preparation? Like you said your</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> mother had clothes --</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My mother had lots of clothes made, and I had a ba -- brand new quilt for my</p><p> bed, and she packed all my things, and I had some of my favorite books. One was</p><p> about three Teddy bears, another one was about Kaspalay(ph), which is a puppet.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="5"></span>  Interview with Erica Kanter deg October 15, 2010 And I also had family photo albums that she gave me. And -- but I really don't remember being scared or traumatized. I-I just didn't really know what was going on, I was nine years old.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What about -- and your brother and your sister were -- went as well?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, we all three left together. Now, I'm sure that my sister, who was 14, and my brother, who was 12, have more memories of it than I did. My brother, for example, remembers my mother saying goodbye to us at the railroad station. And I've read recently that Nazis did not want parents on the station -- on the platform, but apparently my mother did go, and my brother remembers that. I don't remember that at all.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So you don't -- you don't recall the days leading up -- whether or not -- how you were feeling --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, not really.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Do you recall the -- the journey to England at all?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: A little bit. I played the violin at that time, and I know they made me play the violin on the train, because many Jewish families bought expensive musical instruments to give to their children to take out, so that they could be sold for money later. And so the Nazis wanted to make sure that I could play the violin,  <span class="page-break" number="6"></span>  Interview with Erica Kanter me October 15, 2010 and I did, and I remember I played "Ach du lieber Augustine," which was a famous song at the time for children. But that's all I really remember.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay, did you know if you went by train to -- to Holland?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think so, and then by whatever to England, and we went to London where the three English families that were taking us, met us. And my sister went to Buxton, my brother went to Harrow, and I went to Marple, which is outside Manchester.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. So what was the family like who you lived with?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My foster father was professor of engineering at the University of Manchester, and his wife Edith. And they had twin daughters who were about six months older than I, Joyce and Kathleen. And the day that I arrived, and we went to Marple, my English family had a high tea in my honor. And I was very surprised, because I thought my foster mother spoke fluent German, I thought this is very easy to understand. And then when it was bedtime, the woman I thought was my foster mother disappeared. Turns out that my foster parents had invited the German teacher from the high school to come for the day and make my transition less traumatic. But from then on, I was on my own. But they were wonderful. And I am still in touch with them, and in 2008 I went to England for the twins 80" birthday. And we correspond, we send each other letters with pictures of our  <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion</p><p> Interview with Erica Kanter "</p><p> October 15, 2010</p><p> grandchildren, and we're still very close. The only one in the family who is that</p><p> way with the English family is I. My brother and sister did not keep in touch with</p><p> theirs until a few years later.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Wa -- were there a lot of English customs that you had to adjust to, that</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> was different from home?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, the one that I remember -- and at -- at this time, you could still write to</p><p> Germany from England. My English foster mother always gave me tea, like</p><p> everyone else in the family, but I refused to have milk in it, and she thought that</p><p> that might not be good for me, so she wrote to my mother and asked whether it</p><p> was all right for me to have tea without milk in it. And my mother said, oh yes,</p><p> she has tea at home all the time. Well, what my mother didn't realize is that</p><p> English tea is very strong and very dark, whereas in Germany tea is fairly weak.</p><p> And so my mother said no, it's fine. So I learned to drink English tea, but was not</p><p> very fond of it. And I wasn't too fond of mutton either, although I did like</p><p> Shepherd's pie, which is ground mutton with mashed potatoes and gravy.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I like that as well.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And high tea, I liked high tea. And I had never had Jell-O, and very often my</p><p> English foster mother made a dessert with different colors of Jell-O that was all</p><p> chopped up and very pretty. And she also made lemon curd, which I'd never had  <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion</p><p> Interview with Erica Kanter " October 15, 2010 before. And she always told me when I met them later in 1980, that I would come to the kitchen and I would try to help, and I would say, I will make -- meaning that I would help her. And I remember squeezing lots of lemons for lemon curd.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So did -- you said that you had taken some English lessons, but did it take you a while to learn the la -- the -- your new language?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I guess so, although I really don't remember.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you attend school when you were in England?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, I went to school a week after I got there. I went to Manchester High School for girls, which was an elementary school in Manchester, so we commuted from Marple to Manchester, and the twins went with me. I think they were probably a year ahead of me in school. And I remember loving my school.</p><p>And then when the war started in September, after a while, when bombing started in Manchester, like many other British children, we were evacuated to the countryside. So I had another English family, a Mrs. Emerson and her daughter, who was in her 20s. She was the -- the -- Mrs. Emerson was a widow. And I went to the Cheadle Hulme school, which was an affiliate of the school in Manchester.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did the two twins go with you when you went --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="9"></span>  Interview with Erica Kanter 8 October 15, 2010</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, the twins went to boarding school. And the school I went to was a boarding school, but I went as a day student.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Where were your brother and sister at this time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My brother was in Harrow with his English family, and my sister was in Buxton with hers. My brother's family had a daughter who was a little bit older than my brother, and my sister's family I think had four children. And I saw them once while I was in England, we all got together in Harrow.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did you return to Marple after being evacuated to the countryside, or did you --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I went there I think on weekends, or whatever. I just didn't go to school in Manchester any more.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did you experience any air raids, did you --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, I didn't.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So what -- do you recall ha -- what your knowledge was of the war during this time? Did you read about it, or hear about what was going on?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not really. I knew that there was a war. The one thing I do remember is that Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret Rose, spoke on the radio every week to the children of Great Britain to keep our courage up. And that's about all I remember.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How long were you there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion</p><p> Interview with Erica Kanter " October 15, 2010</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was there for about a year.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. So, do -- and you -- you wrote to your mother. How long did you -- were you able to keep in contact with your family?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I really don't remember, but I know in the beginning. Now, my mother stayed in Germany because she didn't have a German visa, she was born in -- in Prague, so she had a Czech visa. And there -- it wasn't quite as rapid. And she eventually, she tried to pack up our -- all our house, and our paintings, our -- all our belongings to send to the United States, and of course nothing was ever delivered. My parents lost everything. But she left to go to Italy where my maternal grandparents had a house, which she inherited. So she went to Italy on the pretense of going to sell that house, and she never left Italy. And she then went through Portugal in September of 1940 and came directly to the United States. So I hadn't seen her for a year and a half.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Where was your father? I know he said -- you -- he got a visa. Did he -- where did he leave to?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He left, and came through Switzerland to Harrow. He lived in a boarding house in Harrow, so he and my brother did see each other while they were there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you -- did -- you didn't see your father though, at all?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="11"></span>  Interview with Erica Kanter 6 October 15, 2010</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I saw him once, the one time that I went to Harrow. And then in April or May of 1940, my brother, my sister, I and my father all came over by boat on the Britannic to the United States. And my father had a research fellowship in Ypsilanti, Michigan, because he couldn't practice medicine yet. And then a year later he passed the medical exam and then he moved to Massachusetts with us.</p><p>And the reason we went to Massachusetts is there were very few states where you could practice medicine without being a citizen, and Massachusetts was one of them. So we moved to Braintree, Massachusetts, which is just outside Boston, and he started his practice again, and after a beginning struggle, he became very successful and eventually taught at Tufts Medical School, and put all three of us through college.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's fabulous.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So what year was it that you immigrated to the U.S.?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: 739,</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: deg39, okay.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, 1940 we emigrated. We left Germany in deg39, left England in 1940.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: That's wonderful. Okay, so what about -- did you still have grandparents who were --  <span class="page-break" number="12"></span>  Interview with Erica Kanter 6 October 15, 2010</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, my maternal grandparents had died early in the 30s, but my paternal grandparents, my grandfather was also a physician, they lived in Ulm. And it wasn't until 1942 that they were sent out of Ulm. They were told they were going to a Jewish retirement settlement, they couldn't pack very much. And they were sent to Theresienstadt, and they died in Theresienstadt within a week of each other in January of 1943. Now, my parents didn't know that until after the war.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>My parents tried to get them out of Germany and couldn't. And so it wasn't until after war that my father found out that my grandparents had died.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, your -- your brothers and sis -- your brother and sister, did they have a positive experience when they were in England?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, they did. My brother in Harrow, his family was as wonderful, and in fact, his foster mother eventually came to the United States, because his -- their daughter eventually married an American serviceman, and then brought her mother over to the United States. My sister's family also was very nice to her, except in the beginning. My sister at that time was 14, and they sort of treated her as a au pair, a household helper. And it -- that didn't stop until a cousin of my father's from India came to visit and explained to them that, you know, she had been brought up in a very privileged household, and that she shouldn't be treated like a servant. And everything was fine from then on, and you know, she was quite  <span class="page-break" number="13"></span>  Interview with Erica Kanter " October 15, 2010 happy, I'm sure. Although, she was 14, and that's not a -- an easy age to, you know, uproot. But one of the children of that family did visit us in Massachusetts when I was in college. I remember he came -- Aubrey came to visit. But my sister hasn't kept in touch with them, and my brother really didn't keep in touch with his either.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So before we move on, I want to talk about your life in the U.S. You had a photograph of a fr -- a friend of yours, Ursula. Was that someone you knew in England?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes, my best friend from Germany</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Oh, okay.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: --was named Ursula Meyer. And I did visit her in England once. I don't know where, all I know is it was near the ocean somewhere because there is a photograph of the two of us on the beach in bathing suits. And I don't know what ever happened to her, we lost touch when I came to the United States. And I was just curious to see whether she was still alive, and whether she had stayed in England, or whether she got married, or what, I had no idea. And I first got in touch with the Kindertransport Association, to find out whether they could find her on a list anywhere. And they did find an Ursula Meyer, but it was am--a married name, not her m -- her maiden name.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="14"></span> Interview with Erica Kanter a</p><p> October 15, 2010</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, okay. So how old were you when -- when you immigrated to the U.S.?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was nine.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Nine, okay, so did you s-start attending American school right away?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, when I was s -- came to the United States, I was 10. Yes, I--I first went to</p><p> school in New York City for a few weeks, until my father got the research</p><p> fellowship in Michigan. And then I went to elementary school in Michigan for a</p><p> year.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not for me, I-- 1--- you know, I remember my childhood as being a very happy</p><p> childhood and I guess I was always happy from the time I was young, and I don't</p><p> remember really, any traumatic incidences at all, except for one in England,</p><p> which I considered traumatic. My mother, when she was still able to send me</p><p> packages from Germany had sent me a box of cherries from our Bing cherry tree  <span class="page-break" number="15"></span>  Interview with Erica Kanter " October 15, 2010 in Stuttgart. And one night we were to take a bath, and it was my turn to take a bath first. And the bathroom was quite chilly, but there was a nice little cabinet or closet where the hot water heater was, and it was quite warm in there, and you usually dried yourself in there. And I was in there drying myself when I heard one of the twins come up for her bath. And I thought that it was Kathleen, who was the very outgoing twin, and I thought, now wouldn't it be fun to close the cabinet door and then open it and suddenly say boo. Well, I had made a mistake and it was not Kathleen, it was Joyce, who was a little more nervous. And of course, she cried and shrieked and Uncle Cornish(ph), my foster father, sent me to my room for what I considered just fun, but apparently he was concerned because one of the twins was crying. So I remember sitting on my bed on my beautiful new quilt, opening my box of cherries, and I ate every cherry one by one and I kept muttering to myself, and you won't have any, I will eat them all by myself. And then in 1980, when I went back to England for my foster mother's 80" birthday, I told him the story and he couldn't remember it at all. But that's about the only traumatic experience I had. And the only other one was in New York, when I was in school for a few weeks. I remember standing up at my desk to answer a question, and the little boy behind me was measuring the length of my dress with a tuler.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I got married what at that time was considered late in life. 1 was 27 and my husband was 31 and in those days, in 1956 that was considered over the hill. Most of my college friends were already mothers. But I got married in 1956 and I got married at the Harvard chapel, which solved all of the religious problems -- my husband was Jewish. And anyone who went to Harvard, which I did, and he went to the Harvard Business School, was able to get married at the Harvard chapel, so that's where we got married and it solved all the problems of who was going to marry us, and how, and what, and everybody was happy.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you think that your experiences with the Kindertransport affected maybe especially the way that you raised your children?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't think so.

But other than that, I don't think it really influenced my raising my children in any way.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you ever speak to your parents about maybe what they were going through when they --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="19"></span>  Interview with Erica Kanter 4 October 15, 2010</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not really. My father, for example, never talked about Dachau and we never asked him. And it wasn't until he wrote a very small autobiography in 1972 that I learned a little bit about his experiences in Dachau. And I know he told me in that autobiography that two other people from Stuttgart that were sent to Dachau with him, died. One, because he was a diabetic and was not given insulin, and the other from some kind of intestinal infection. And as I said, my father suffered from some kind of sinus problems which had to have surgery once he got out of the hospital -- I mean, out of Dachau and he went to the hospital in Stuttgart, before he went to Switzerland.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Does your mother ever talk about when she was in Germany alone, about what she was experiencing?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not really. We really didn't talk very much about it. And it was just there, you know, we knew that that's what we had gone through. And the only thing -- you asked whether my parents were able to save anything. The only thing that they were able to save -- and this is a -- a rather unique story, a good friend of theirs was Emma Goering, who was a distant cousin of Goering's, who was, of course, one of the biggest Nazis. She was very anti-Nazi, and very outspoken, but they never arrested her or bothered here, I guess because she was related to him. But she was a good friend of my parents. And when my mother was getting everything ready,  <span class="page-break" number="20"></span>  Interview with Erica Kanter 8 October 15, 2010 packed to go to the United States, you were not supposed to take any jewelry or silver, you had to declare that and give it to the government. Well, my mother didn't want to do that. And Emma Goering suggested that she -- my mother give it to her and she would bury it in her garden, in a box, which she did. And during the war, my brother was in the army for four years, and toward the end he was on a leave, and he went to visit Emma Goering, to see if she was still al-alive. And Emma Goering said to him, I have something that belongs to your mother. And they went into her garden, dug up the box, and because he was already a U.S.</p><p>citizen and a serviceman, he was allowed to send it to the United States. So my mother got back all of the jewelry that she had inherited from her grandmother and great-grandmother, her German silverware. And then several years later Emma Goering visited my husband and me in New York City, and she was a charming, charming lady. And so that's the only thing my parents did save, and it was because of her.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So, is there anything else that you -- you would like to add? Any other --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, it's just that I--I guess I was a --a very, very lucky child, because my English foster family was just -- just wonderful. And as I said, I saw them again in 1980 for my foster mother's 80" birthday. And then I went back to England in 2008 for the twins" 80" birthday party. And they were just so compassionate and loving, and so was Mrs. Emerson. And it taught me a good lesson, that compassion and friendliness and love and just being good people is important, and I've tried to teach that to my children.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="22"></span>  Interview with Erica Kanter mu October 15, 2010</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So you've returned to England twice?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Have you ever been back to Germany?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, I went back to Germany first in 1951 with my sister, we went to Europe for three months. And we visited our house in Stuttgart, and then I went back again in 1982, to visit my German cousins on my mother's side of the family, whom I hadn't seen until the mid-30s. And we've become very close friends and so we've gone back to Europe two or three times for birthdays and travel, and -- with them. And so I've been back, yes. And when I went back in 1982, we went to Stuttgart, and the people who owned my parents" house took my husband and me through it, to show us what it was like.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was it different?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And then -- not really. Apparently it was damaged a little bit during the war, but not badly. And the interesting thing is, as we were leaving, a woman next door leaned over the fence and said, Erica, what are you doing here? In German. And it turns out that she was my sister's friend. She was my sister's age, and for some reason she recognized me after all those years. And so I explained to her what happened to us. And so we did see the house in 1982.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you speak German at home with your family after the war?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="23"></span>  Interview with Erica Kanter 8 October 15, 2010</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not really, no. I think once we came to the United States and my father decided we were now going to be Americans, and you know, we really didn't speak much German. But I can still speak it, and I speak it with a strong [indecipherable] accent, and I can understand most German. I can't understand legal German or technical German, but I can read German.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mim-hm, that's wonderful. So, if-- if there's anything else that you would like to add?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I'm just, you know, as I said, I was very lucky, I had a wonderful English family. I know not everyone was as lucky as I was. And we've stayed very close friends, and I've just recognized how -- what a big sacrifice it was for these people, because they didn't know whether they were going to have us for a month or a year or forever. I know there are some Kindertransport children who've been there, you know, were there for seven, eight, nine years. And I was only there for a year. But both families were just wonderful to us, really.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's good.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Pll come sit next to you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, in the beginning, I have pictures of my father and my uncle and my aunt, and those have interesting stories. My uncle, who was an entomologist, left Germany in 1933, went first to Palestine for a few years, then to Venezuela, and eventually ended up in Mexico City, where he became a professor at University of Mexico, as an entomologist. My aunt, whose husband had factories that manufactured felt for printing in both Germany and Italy, left in 1936 and moved to Italy, and a farmer hid him as a farm helper during the war. And my aunt and my three cousins were saved by Italian nuns, who took them to a nunnery. So anyway, these are pictures of my father, and these are pictures of my mother in her childhood.</p></p></dialogue>

And then, these are the pictures of my grandparents, Dr. Ludwig, and [indecipherable] Hecht. And they are the ones who died in Theresienstadt in 1943. And the reason I know that they didn't go there until 1942, late in the year was that there's a letter from them to my cousin in Italy, saying that they were going to have to leave in August of 1942. And then it wasn't til after the war that we found out that they had died, but here's a picture of them.</p></p></dialogue>
