I-- he came to see me, he want to come and see me, in a wheelchair, of course. As soon as he opened the door, he burst out into tears loudly, and he couldn't speak. Tried to break into -- hold a conversation, to engage in something, and didn't come out. So much so that said goodbye, and we left. Few month later, there were -- we were -- the deportation to Auschwitz. I'm always asking myself, what was the -- the -- the cause for that -- what shall I say? Thunder, kind of flood of tears that came out?</p><p>Could it be that I reminded him of the years when he had power, and that caused that? Or, he still had some power, and he knew about the deportation. He knew I had [indecipherable] time. In any case, a few month later -- later, of course he was deported, and he was -- so, let me go back.

There are two people who had the influence. One was the grandfather, who was a gr -- great Talmud scholar, but old-fashioned, if I may use the word [indecipherable] the old-fashioned, but the -- who -- who -- who taught themself [indecipherable] at night, he used to give a--a lesson [indecipherable] Talmud. And -- and he brought me up, that's the male figure that I know. He was very poor, he could hardly support me and my mom, my mother and another sister. But he was then a great influence, that he taught me how to learn on a simple, elementary level. And he was a shochet, he was a Belzer shochet, with uniform, with a kapoto(ph), you know what's a kapoto(ph) and [indecipherable] so from secular knowledge, or secular activity, he had no idea, there was no -- it's no -- he didn't -- you can't even see he rejected it because he had no dealings, or that. So I was brought up, and of course, along these lines. And then people asked -- even today asked me how -- where it comes from. I can't answer the question. Since I remember, even when I was five or six years, and lived under the influence of grandfather, I wanted to study secular knowledge. I wanted to have secular knowledge.</p></p></dialogue>

Maybe you will see what you could do with that. When I was a chi -- five, six years even, and I used to pray, daven, and I said the prayer [indecipherable] God give us in our heart, understanding, to understand you and so on. I remember I used to look at the window, signifying outside knowledge as well, not only religious knowledge.</p><p>Where I got that -- that urge, I don't know. That really, after the war, after the liberation, that was the reason I didn't go to Israel. I wanted -- was afraid I wouldn't be able to study there, I didn't know, secular knowledge, so I went to the United States where the -- so -- so I had the -- but then I was -- so grandfather had the enormous influence, other than some ideas. I was never a shochet, never believed in the [indecipherable], even though grandfather used to tell miracles, and the [indecipherable]. And then, of course, that lasted til -- til deg44, and then "44, the other person that had the influence on me, was Professor Saul Lieberman, who was the great -- the great Talmud scholars.

Man is created in a manner at least that -- that he could do -- God would not interfere -- will punish him, but He will not interfere with this evildoing. So, to ask, which is the basic question for a religious person, why God did not intervene in our time, when intervened in -- intervened in the time of Haman. The idea that something moved in the cosmological sphere, that caw -- that God did not intervene. He intervened at that time, did not intervene. So, we cannot be -- I think sometimes even Netanyahu or the others, it was naive to think that an Israeli, the Israeli power, military, could prevent Hitler.

Now, God will intervene on our behalf, apparently if we have -- we -- we are in debt, a certain -- and maintaining a certain [indecipherable] for certain relationship. That is a very delicate balance. When that relationship is disturbed, God may not intervene.
