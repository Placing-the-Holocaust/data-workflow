The interviewer is Michael Abramowitz, and we are at the museum in Washington, D.C. So, professor, I would like to start with some basic questions: where were you born, and --and where were you raised?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I was born in a little village, which changed hands a number of times. It was called Poliana Kobyletska. Poliana, p-o-l-y-n, koba, k-o-b -- koba, b-e-l-e-c-k-y, that's how I spell it. At that time, when I was born, it was Czechoslovakia. Then for a while after the war, it was Russia. Now it's Ukraine.</p><p>But my father got there because -- which is interesting -- all of a sudden -- that's what people told me, a wonder rabbi appeared.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: A wonder rabbi?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. Supposedly he performed miracles. He knew a person, the ba -- sickness, which is always the platform for wonder people, you know, to heal, to -- and my f-- and he needed somebody to set up his -- his sel -- activities, and my father was chosen, and therefore he moved to -- he -- he settled in Poliana, in Ponya(ph), and he moved there. And of course, I was there, I was born there. I tell it because all of a sudden, two or three years later, he ceased performing miracles, and the whole  <span class="page-break" number="0"></span> Interview with David Halivni , June 13, 2014</p><p> thing evaporated, and there was no -- there was no reason for my grandfather -- for my father any more to stay there, and we moved away from there, we moved to a bigger city called Houst(ph) or Hist(ph), Houst(ph). May I also tell you, I think it's interesting, you -- you'll decide what you want do with this story. After this he became paralyzed, and nobody even know where -- what happened then. The whole thing, the whole -- there were only 50 families, Jewish families in -- in that village, and if he left, th --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was his whole body paralyzed?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Whole bo-body, th -- we need -- and people didn't -- didn't hear from him, I didn't know what happened. And then, a few month before deportation, in "44, I got a message he appeared, reappeared. Must have been in an institution the meantime, I don't know. He reappeared, and asked to be -- he wants to see me. I was come pa -- I was [indecipherable] outside my narrow -- he must have heard, he wants to come.</p></p></dialogue>

I-- he came to see me, he want to come and see me, in a wheelchair, of course. As soon as he opened the door, he burst out into tears loudly, and he couldn't speak. Tried to break into -- hold a conversation, to engage in something, and didn't come out. So much so that said goodbye, and we left. Few month later, there were -- we were -- the deportation to Auschwitz. I'm always asking myself, what was the -- the -- the cause for that -- what shall I say? Thunder, kind of flood of tears that came out?</p><p>Could it be that I reminded him of the years when he had power, and that caused that? Or, he still had some power, and he knew about the deportation. He knew I had [indecipherable] time. In any case, a few month later -- later, of course he was deported, and he was -- so, let me go back. My father left, went back to Houst(ph), and we lived in Houst(ph) two or three years, and then my mother and father broke up, and the age four or five -- I was born in "27 -- the age of four or five, we -- Mother left Father, and we went to Sighet, where my grandfather lived. It was in Sighet that I was brought up, and I lived there with grandfather. Finally they were divorced.

There are two people who had the influence. One was the grandfather, who was a gr -- great Talmud scholar, but old-fashioned, if I may use the word [indecipherable] the old-fashioned, but the -- who -- who -- who taught themself [indecipherable] at night, he used to give a--a lesson [indecipherable] Talmud. And -- and he brought me up, that's the male figure that I know. He was very poor, he could hardly support me and my mom, my mother and another sister. But he was then a great influence, that he taught me how to learn on a simple, elementary level. And he was a shochet, he was a Belzer shochet, with uniform, with a kapoto(ph), you know what's a kapoto(ph) and [indecipherable] so from secular knowledge, or secular activity, he had no idea, there was no -- it's no -- he didn't -- you can't even see he rejected it because he had no dealings, or that. So I was brought up, and of course, along these lines. And then people asked -- even today asked me how -- where it comes from. I can't answer the question. Since I remember, even when I was five or six years, and lived under the influence of grandfather, I wanted to study secular knowledge. I wanted to have secular knowledge.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you go to -- did you go to a secular school at all?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="3"></span>  Interview with David Halivni " June 13, 2014</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's what they -- people asking me, where did that come. Maybe you will see what you could do with that. When I was a chi -- five, six years even, and I used to pray, daven, and I said the prayer [indecipherable] God give us in our heart, understanding, to understand you and so on. I remember I used to look at the window, signifying outside knowledge as well, not only religious knowledge.</p><p>Where I got that -- that urge, I don't know. That really, after the war, after the liberation, that was the reason I didn't go to Israel. I wanted -- was afraid I wouldn't be able to study there, I didn't know, secular knowledge, so I went to the United States where the -- so -- so I had the -- but then I was -- so grandfather had the enormous influence, other than some ideas. I was never a shochet, never believed in the [indecipherable], even though grandfather used to tell miracles, and the [indecipherable]. And then, of course, that lasted til -- til deg44, and then "44, the other person that had the influence on me, was Professor Saul Lieberman, who was the great -- the great Talmud scholars. And then eventually I adopted the more scientific, or the more critical approach -- could tell you I -- to the study of Talmud, which I now write, teach, preach.</p></p></dialogue>

We had no pi-- we didn't had hot water in the house, we had to warm it up [indecipherable]. So once a week, Friday, as you could imagine, we went, and there was ambatya(ph), a bath. We had to pay for it, and grand -- but the -- I was allowed for the two of us, he and me to use the same -- the same bath. One day -- one week -- one Friday -- be th-there was a seat there, I remember, and there were two -- what's the English word for ambatya(ph)? What is it called, the one that -- it escapes me.

So I told him. And I was stretching out my hand to get money. He turns to me, he says, how do I know that you are right? I remember it to this day, over here, I -- I have -- that was taken back, that he -- he has such a [indecipherable] question. He -- I -- but I wanted the money, and he was willing to give, so I told him, if I'll tell you the 10, the 15, the 20" and the 25", would you give me the money?

She died afterwards a natural death, but that, of course, made life much more miserable. She was relatively intelligent, she had a Hungarian [indecipherable]. She had ambition, she was a-- which were never realized. So, she was religious. So finally she was claimed by the crematoria, when she came. That was [indecipherable]. And then I was together with the aunt, she had a sister. The problem was that when we came to grandfather, we were four people; grandfather and the three children. I had a sister, and I'm one -- the sick sister, and myself, and she and the mother, we were four people. Grandfather, with difficulty, could support us, which made -- cal -- created tension. We had really no full job. So we ca -- we -- we -- we came to gt-gr-grand-mother, she had to [indecipherable] in the -- the -- the kitchen, they have, of course, and the -- the household, and so on. But she was always -- always a sense of bitterness. But the problem was when we came the grandfather, in addition to the poverty, he had two still unmarried daughters. And in those time, marriageable -- to marriage, to get dowry, was not an easy -- one easy thing. And the -- and that, of course, added tension to the house, which I [indecipherable] occasionally used to shout at me, then the other -- I was convinced that they were against me. And then finally one got married, and faced a tragedy; husband died within two or three years. But the other daughter came with me, though shu -- she must have been about in the late 20s, you  <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> ontactrefiranneGaushariarg a hither atrmedortabeattfiexaliaton Interview with David Halivni @ June 13, 2014 could imagine those days, probably [indecipherable] to explain, you'll understand.</p><p>I thought she's against me, and there is nothing I could do. But I knew that if you make a Mi Shebeirach, you know what a Mi Shebeirach is? When you read the Torah, if you want ask for health, or for anything, you read -- you make -- ask for a special blessing while the Torah, the scroll is on the table, that has special -- so as a child, eight or nine, I thought that will work negatively too.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It's like a curse or something.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Something left. I didn't realize that when we arrived at Auschwitz 70 years ago, and they opened up the cars, and they shouted [speaks German] | apparently was near the door, and I jumped out from among the first one on the -- I heard the shouting after me in Yiddish [speaks Yiddish]. The Torah that you so much worked on -- worked on it -- on there, should offend you -- protect you. And I contribute -- and it did protect.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's wonderful. So she -- she -- you -- you realized that she -- she loved you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: She realized that time that she loved me. In the Torah that you so much worked on -- n-not so that I'd worked, that -- that there's -- there's so much willing to renounce, conveniences [indecipherable] convenience in order to achieve it,  <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> </p><p> Interview with David Halivni 8 June 13, 2014</p><p> protect. She was -- she didn't go to the crematoria, she went to a labor camp, and she died there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can you -- I -- I wonder if it's possible if you could just take a -- a couple minutes to tell us a little bit about what life was like in the town where you grew up. Just -- it's a very -- it's interesting, because you're a connection to a-- to a-- hundreds of years of history that have been lost to many of us. But -- and it was -- and that was destroyed, you know, in the Holocaust.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The -- the city? The city --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was life like there, when you grew up?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The city was almost 10,000 Jews, mainly Hassidim. There were non-religious Jews too, but I didn't know them, I found out after the war. Some of the youth were communists, like in other places. Religious. But I wa -- I think I'm making a--a truthful statement; when I came to Sighet when I was 40 years old, so that could be 31 -- "32. There may have been seven -- several hundred young people with payos.</p><p>When I left Sighet in "44, there were less than 50. So this secularization [indecipherable] or the communization had enormous impact. The Jews were generally poor, all Hassidim of certain Rebbes, engaged in quarrel, in [indecipherable] as there is always between the Rebbes. And little -- none -- no connection with the non-Jews. I -- we -- the language we spoke, and didn't even  <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> Interview with David Halivni " June 13, 2014</p><p> know it, was Yiddish. I mean, I know Yiddish, how to go buy -- buy in the -- in the shop. But I didn't know [indecipherable] the Yiddish, I didn't even know that there is some Germans in Yiddish, I eventually found out that the German's in Yiddish.</p><p>After the war I felt a kind of [indecipherable] a kind of poetic urge to write down, jot down, but I know no language, only Yiddish. So I jotted down in Yiddish, and I was embarrassed to show. But not long ago, I took it out, and they're translating it to French. So I don't know Yiddish, but not literally, I guess. And although in my time there was already compuls -- education was compulsory. But since I was born in the Czechoslovakian side, and I lived in Sighet, Romania, Mother denied me.</p><p>Every year before scrips -- school, the -- an official came and asked, well is -- are there children of school age, Mother could deny.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see. This is a Romanian official, or Hungarian official?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: A Romanian official.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Romanian official, okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But after the da -- ma -- the Hungarian came in, she couldn't deny. She was afraid to deny me because that would be [indecipherable]. So she burst out, she acknowledged, she confessed that she have. And then became [indecipherable] I was already almost [indecipherable].

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, to record the story, it's -- it's -- there was a -- start from the very beginning.</p><p>The -- technically, we had off every second Sunday, but we did not -- but they did  <span class="page-break" number="30"></span> ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion Interview with David Halivni x June 13, 2014 not really realized it. The al -- the SS always found an excuse. Supposedly we are volunteering. But the -- nevertheless, it happened a few sunda -- a few hours where we could sit and -- and do nothing, the SS didn't bother us. So there was the ca -- the -- th-the -- the ca -- the people that worked, it's called -- it was called Ackerman(ph) who do the drilling, and who had th -- they had kapo, also the name of Weiss. And when we were sitting that do -- that Sunday, or that -- we sort of -- supposedly free Sunday, he was [indecipherable] and we talked, I remembered what we learned in si -- the [indecipherable] of sha -- Sh-Shabbat, because the people knew it from the book, from the prayer book and so on.

Ackerman(ph), who was doing the -- it was a very difficult company, and therefore, while the others worked 12 hours and na -- they worked only 10. And the occasion, sometimes they even got cigarettes from the company, from -- so when I got cigarettes, I sold it for bread. So, the idea was why -- why would they take me to a company which worked so ha -- was more difficult than the others? Because those drillers, you know, that made the hole, had to be sharpened. And they didn't want that to be bring to a fire, to a schmidder(ph) -- to a smith. They wa -- they didn't want to do it in the ca -- in the -- in the -- in the tunnel itself, fire, so it was outside. So somebody had to bring those dri-driller to the schmi-- where they sharpened, and bring it back, two or three  <span class="page-break" number="30"></span>  Interview with David Halivni 8 June 13, 2014 times, or more times during a -- a night, let's say.

So, during my -- at night, when we worked at night, I used to do four or five times, going through from a -- from the -- the place of work, inside the hotel, pending -- every day it got larger and larger, to the outside where they were sharpened, and bring it back, and so on. That's why I said before, I walked with [indecipherable]. I had to be very careful, because when the other people took out the -- the stones, the -- the -- the pla -- the -- where the dynamite exploded, they had then a ca -- a little cheela(ph) they called, a ca -- a little [indecipherable] car -- cars, so -- and there was hardly any room for a car or for a human being, had to -- there were cases where people [indecipherable].

I often quote, and I th -- the -- the -- the mishna(ph), and [indecipherable] says that, if the court executed somebody, the family of the convict, family of the -- should come to the court, to the judges, and say [speaks foreign language]. We have nothing against our hearts on you. In other words, justice, it was coming. We almost have to g-go -- come Hitler and say we have nothing [indecipherable] it's because of sin. So that I reject, full-hearted. So although not as successful for a substitute, we don't have something that I could substitute. So, the idea is, leave it. Leave it as it is. That's why [indecipherable] without a reason. Because any reason will ultimately -- whether, you know, the Rabbi of [indecipherable], who se -- by the way, I was close to him, I was close to him. The Rabbi [indecipherable] thought the Zionist is the sin.

We're just about five minutes away. Are you ready? Oh, okay, I'm sorry. So, what I wanted to ask you is, do you think there's anything -- cause Wiesel has talked about -- you know, one of the reasons he wanted this museum to be formed, was he wanted to, obviously have a permanent memorial to the victims, but also to remind people about what can happen in the future. And so my question to you is, the Holocaust was a unique event in human history, but do you think there is something to learn from that episode that might help us prevent this kind of thing from happening in the future? Maybe not on the same level, but the same kind -- genocides have existed --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was the topic that Yad Vashem asked me to talk about here a year ago, or two years ago.

"m not sure that -- that we could be sure that there will be no other Holocaust, since, as I said before, I think it's a metaphysical. Has something to do with free will. Man is created in a manner at least that -- that he could do -- God would not interfere -- will punish him, but He will not interfere with this evildoing. So, to ask, which is the basic question for a religious person, why God did not intervene in our time, when intervened in -- intervened in the time of Haman. The idea that something moved in the cosmological sphere, that caw -- that God did not intervene. He intervened at that time, did not intervene. So, we cannot be -- I think sometimes even Netanyahu or the others, it was naive to think that an Israeli, the Israeli power, military, could prevent Hitler. Whoever remens -- remembers the power of the German army -- now we have this Normandy, just what is it, 70 years?</p></p></dialogue>

So we are --I don't know, I am still working find out what is sort of -- but it is our relationship to God, Jews, as I still believe was the chosen people, but they are chosen because God gave the Torah. And giving the Torah is a sort of intervene -- intervention in a u-- ina person's life. God intervened -- asked -- intervenes in our life by telling us what to do, what not to do.

[indecipherable] the -- involves responsibility as well as -- as co -- as singling out, and so on. Now, God will intervene on our behalf, apparently if we have -- we -- we are in debt, a certain -- and maintaining a certain [indecipherable] for certain relationship. That is a very delicate balance. When that relationship is disturbed, God may not intervene. I don't know, I don't have the picture, I mean [indecipherable] clearly, but that's the direction I'm thinking. I cannot accept sin as the cause.</p></p></dialogue>

Why, why pale? I was sitting [indecipherable] in the closed doors, and he was doing sports, and why I survived? So, does that entail a special obligation, a special tha -- usually that -- that leads, or should lead to more learning, but that's individual, and -- and that's usu -- the [indecipherable] having accomplished something.

So they interviewed, I think in a German ta -- TV, asking them, how -- when did -- did they know to open up the -- the window, have the gas in there? He said, I put my ear to the window. If I didn't hear shmizel(ph) at all, I know I could open the window. And I told this story to chile -- my grandchild told me -- told the story to his children, they all burst out shmizel(ph).
