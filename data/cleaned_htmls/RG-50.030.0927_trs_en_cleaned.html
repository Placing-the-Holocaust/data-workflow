Since the war had started in September 1939, Rosie had heard only sporadically about their two girls, Doris and Hannah(ph), since they had left for England. Direct communication between England and Germany was no longer possible, and it will come directly through friends or relatives in neutral places, like America, or Shanghai, or some South American countries.

It was, they put the school on a train, they sent you to these remote places, where mostly really poor people had volunteered to take the children, and they got some money. So, you get off the train. They walk you down -- down the street, knock on the door, here are two kids, here are two kids. And we -- we were all -- the English kids were in exactly the same position.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was early on, and there was hope that they -- we would meet, and all come to America together.

<dialogue class=""><p>Because one of the German kids, somebody said to her, where -- you know, where did you get your accent from? She picked up my accent.

Cause there wasn't much -- you know, wherever we lived in England, they were all non-Jewish, I mean, all the families were not Jewish. I think the only Jewish family is the girl that I lived with in the end. I'm sure they were Jewish.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay, okay, yeah.

There weren't any Jews left, but -- but Fulda, and the mayor, and you know, they're part of the restitution. And a whole lot of us went.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We just went through that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I think we did, but I'd like to ground this chronologically.

So 19 eight --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And that was actually very meaningful for everybody.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>A2: It was -- we went back in May of 1987.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, first of all, it was really interesting, because my aunt, who said she'd never go, since I was free, and -- her family was going. There were a whole lot of us. A lot of her sisters and brothers of my family. We -- we were a whole group. And it -- it was very meaningful to the family as a group, because you know, Steven came, my cousins from -- Berta's(ph) own children came. Other children from these 11 offspring came. And -- and it was very well organized. I mean, we met in the schloss, which wasn't hurt at all.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes, it's a pretty city.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because, you know, it wasn't really demolished, I mean, so it had a lot of the original history. And so many people came from Israel, from all over the place.</p><p>And then there's just a small, funny aside, and a lot of religious people cou -- course it was -- the mayor, and another person who'd come from Israel, I mean, they -- they worked it out. And the people who went to this school were paid for, but all the relatives who came, we all paid for ourselves.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So it turned out to be a much bigger group than they were expecting. Lufthansa ca-catered the kosher food.

In fact, I didn't -- I never talked it. So when we got the first day -- I had a ca -- bad -- my aunt had a daughter who was very interested in keeping in touch with whatever groups there were. Unfortunately, she's not alive any more. But she had written to Judith Miller.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: An author of a book called, "One by One by One."</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right. Who happened to be in Germany covering the Nuremberg trials, or something. And she showed up the next day, came up to me, and said, can you tell me who Nancy Kamp(ph) is, my cousin is, and I said yes, she's over there. So Judith Miller talked to Nancy. Really liked Steven because he was young, and not an old refugee, and cottoned onto him. I think he -- he -- you were at Harvard at the time, right?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>A2: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So-- you know, so she held onto me, and to Steven.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And they started the speeches. So Steven is saying, what are they saying, and Judith is saying, what are they saying.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So when you were now living --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Do you remember that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>A2: Very, very well.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So I was able to translate, but I hadn't talked -- I hadn't talked it.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It's interesting too, that when you went to live with your relatives once you arrived in Brooklyn, that that means you didn't speak German with each other at home. You must have spoken English.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p>A2: Thirty years ago. I remember -- I remember it pretty vividly. There was a large group, and the town, and the press really beyond the town, in Germany, I guess this was a time when there was a lot of interest in Germany about Jews coming back to visit. And I remember getting off the plane when we first arrived in Germany, and <span class="page-break" number="90"></span> ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion Interview with Dorothea Fingerhood " April 27, 2017 departing off the plane with my mother and the whole group.

And then -- and then the next day we looked, and you know, the -- the local TV station, and I think even beyond the local TV station had, you know, news reports about the Jews of Fulda coming back.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No, 30 is not a lot.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>A2: And the town made a big effort, and the mayor of the town, who I think later had a more prominent political, you know, career in ger -- in modern Germany, had -- one of his initiatives was to try and rebuild a temple in Fulda, as a way of emphasizing, you know, a new -- a new post-Nazi view, and -- and I think he was the one behind organizing --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Right. <span class="page-break" number="92"></span> ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion Interview with Dorothea Fingerhood 8 April 27, 2017 A2: -- the Jews in Fulda to return. But it -- it was -- it was very intensely personal for my mother and her family and our family, but you couldn't miss the fact that it had this political significance.

And I think we rang on the doorbell. No one answered.

<dialogue class=""><p>A2: And I think that the local Gestapo, or local party, you know, would -- you know, designate who could take over, so it was often people who were, you know --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Connected.</p><p>A2: -- friends of the Nazi party.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: These are suppositions, but this is what comes through your mind as you're -- A2: No, I remember someone telling me at the -- cause I remember after it, thinking like -- asking like, how is it -- how di -- when a house got vacated, who determined who got it.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Got it, okay.</p></p></dialogue>

So we were trying very hard to be like reassuring, and you know, kind of very appreciative that she was letting us see the house. And the rest of my mother and the relatives were sort of going back, looking through the house, and she kind of turned to me, and I was kind of more wa -- I was kind of running interference. I was like talking to her, and letting everyone else see the house. And there wa -- and I said, thank you for letting us see the house, it really means a lot, you know. And she said, it's okay. And then there was a silence. And then she looked at me, and she looked down, and she said, you know, these shoes are terrible. These shoes hurt so much. I cannot get a pair of shoes that fit me, and I have a ki-- you know, my feet really ache, it's very hard to walk.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Of course not.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>A2: But, I-I believe that she was --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: She was asking you to give some money for shoes?</p><p>A2: No, no, no, I don't think that at all.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I mean, that thought crossed my mind, too, maybe.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p>A2: It was very odd for us to be there, and for her to be -- she wasn't saying, give me money for a new pair of shoes.

And then I said, well, that's a shame, you know, thanks again, it's a very nice house. And then she said, oh, the house. It's -- it's very hard to maintain. There's lots of difficulty. It-- you -- there's always something that has to be fixed, and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: All this is in German, and you understood it?</p><p>A2: It was broken, you know, but I understood it. And I -- must have been in broken English, cause I didn't speak German, so --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay.</p><p>A2: It must have been English. But she was sort of ex -- she wa -- the two things she communicated to me was, her shoes hurt, she was very uncomfortable, and the house is -- is really a burden, but what can you do? And I was sort of ext -- I was kind of nodding and, you know, kind of saying that, gee, that's a shame. And I was thinking to myself, you know, you're -- you seem -- oh, I remember, there was one other thing. I said like, oh, you know, how long have you lived here? And she said, oh, you know, a very long time. And I said oh, like when -- like, since when? And she said oh -- she didn't -- she said a lon -- you know, had it for a long time. I do -- and then she said something very vague. And so I combined that with her obvious discomfort, and her saying that the house was a burden, and I thought it was -- I thought she was -- I took it to mean that she was dealing with, you know, <span class="page-break" number="108"></span> ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion Interview with Dorothea Fingerhood m April 27, 2017 ambivalence, and guilt, and discomfort at the part -- I believe that somehow, some way, she was part of stealing the house.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>A2: And I think she was feeling -- and I think that she realized no one was going to be making a claim against her. This was simply us remembering the -- the place where we had been harmed, and exiled, or my family had been. And I don't think she could handle it. So I think the way she handled it was to say, this is really uncomfortable, these shoes really hurt. Och, it's terrible. My poor -- I --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: My poor feet, yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't remember that at all.</p><p>A2: And I remember just being floored by it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Well, ee -- as I said, it sounds like a very -- such a bizarre kind of statement at the significance -- even if it's not her significance, but significance to people who have come to her door, and that her mind would not be on, why is this significant for them, but on something like this. <span class="page-break" number="109"></span> ontactrefieannedjustanmiang er hither btemelortabnattfiexaliaton Interview with Dorothea Fingerhood " April 27, 2017 A2: You're going to uh-oh, who --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>A2: And then I remember one more thing, she said to me, so -- and you know, my mother mentioned that the Nazis very often thought she was a good Aryan girl.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Individual stories.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>A2: That's why it's called, "One by One by One."</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And she was covering some trial in Germany, and my cousin had written to her, and that's why she came.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><p>A2: And so, a chapter in the book chronicled her accompanying this group to Fulda.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>A2: So that's kind of the background.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><p>A2: So it says: "But with the surfacing of good memories, came the bad and the ambivalent. One day, for example, some of the Lumps mustered the courage to visit their former home. It had been occupied for years by a woman, now very old, whose husband had probably bought it at auction from the Nazis." Presumably, the author of this book researched it, and got her own information. "She let us enter in stages, said Doris Fingerhood, Rosie's daughter, who had left Germany for England when she was 11 years old. The house looked physically much as I remembered it, only much smaller. I kept thinking, where did my parents put 11 children? But I had remembered the house as full of character, now it was peculiarly devoid of any. The woman who owned it," -- this is my mother speaking -- "the woman who owned it was 80. She kept saying that she had lived there for 20 years, but knew nothing about how her husband, who was dead, had acquired it. She was crusty, and very formal, typically German. I didn't know what to believe, and that made me uncomfortable. She comp -- she complained about her health, about the cost of keeping up the house. It was so expensive to maintain that she couldn't travel, Doris said. Finally, she looked at Steven and me, at our blondish hair and <span class="page-break" number="113"></span> ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion Interview with Dorothea Fingerhood m7 April 27, 2017 blue eyes, and said, you don't look like the Lumps. There was a final shock awaiting them. Regina's bedroom was virtually unchanged from the day she had died there, with one exception. Over what had been the Lump family's old double bed hung a large wooden cross. I'm glad my mother could not see it, Doris said softly." And then it goes on to talk about other things.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's true.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>A2: So that's the history of --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: That's the history from different voices, your voice, your voice --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And her voice.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- and jud -- and her voice -- and Judith Miller's voice.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>A2: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I mean, one of the things that I'd like to ask both of you, and this touches -- I mean, your -- your story on this touches on that, and that's that theme of, what do contacts with Germans, ethnic Germans, non-Jews, what kind of contacts are there, so many years after the war, and what kind of feelings do they leave you with? And [ll preface that also with a thought. I usually try not to be leading, but I get the impression, after talking to so many people, that one of the most difficult aspects in this story is -- the large story, is the loss of trust, and can trust ever be regained? And I wonder if that plays a role here. So there's really two questions. <span class="page-break" number="114"></span> ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion Interview with Dorothea Fingerhood ue April 27, 2017</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I don't think I can answer that, but I can tell you for my aunts and uncles, like Julius, who was a big football player, and -- A2: Soccer.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, I just -- my own feeling was that the mayor, and whoever the powers-to-be who had arranged this, did a very good job, because it seemed successful. <span class="page-break" number="115"></span> ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion Interview with Dorothea Fingerhood " April 27, 2017 A2: That's true, but you're not answering how -- the question is like, how did it leave you, in terms of feeling you could trust people or not?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was just glad I wasn't there any more.

You know, I think that -- I think that it's -- I don't -- I-I think two things. I don't think it's a --I don't think it's nearly as simple as, the Germans did something bad to the Jews. That's certainly true, but it's also true -- although it's horrific to say -- that there were Gentile friends of Rose and Leo who risked their lives to save -- to hide them, until 1944. And the -- they -- they perished instead of surviving the war, because of a f -- fellow Jew, who -- who ratted them out, you know.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: So it's very complicated.</p><p>A2: So I don't think -- I -- if there's an us versus them, it -- it's not Germans versus Jews, you know. So I'm -- but, you know, I don't think -- it's one thing to read about horrible things in the paper, or in history books, but when you see it through your own family, or your mother or grandparents, it's very dark. And the idea that neighbors didn't know what was going on, to me is --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Hard to believe.</p><p>A2:--is nonsense. And -- and it -- to me, it was the little things, like the reaction of this woman, that just betrayed the fact that -- you know, there was lots of complicity in -- in bad acts. And so, I don't feel like, oh I can't trust Germans. And I've been to Germany a lot, and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Since then? <span class="page-break" number="117"></span> ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion Interview with Dorothea Fingerhood mt April 27, 2017 A2: Yes. And you know, in the modern wor -- I mean, the interesting thing, by the way, is that one big contingent of visitors on this trip to Fulda were Germans who had emigrated to Israel. And they -- and you know, Israel and Germany have a very functional relationship right now. And Germany is important to Israel's economy. And what I found interesting was that the Israelis had -- had gotten over this a long time ago. Israelis did not exhibit a lot of ambivalence, or --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Interesting.</p><p>A2: -- you know, emotional complication. American Jews did. Israeli Jews had other problems.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, that's also interesting.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>A2: So I-I guess -- first of all, [indecipherable] fascinated --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: That's very interesting. I didn't even think about that.</p><p>A2: But, I mean, what I want to say is like I -- I found it scarring. I found the experience scarring, you know, just kind of feeling like I was reliving through my mother, you know, or her relatives, like what had happened. I think it was a hugely traumatic thing. And I think everyone has, you know, lived remarkably good lives, given such a rip in the entire family support system, fabric. And look, that happened to a lot of people in that time, but this was really acute. <span class="page-break" number="118"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 122 Interview with Dorothea Fingerhood April 27, 2017</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: One reason that I ask that, is that willy or nilly, we are having this conversation several generations after the events. And the fact that we have it so many years, decades after the events, when there are several -- that influences us. How you speak of something -- you don't have different facts, but how you speak of the facts 10 years afterwards, two years afterwards, and 50 years afterwards, changes somewhat, is influenced by things. And today, there are young Germans who, I've heard often say -- and it's not the only voice. It's not the only voice, but they say, this happened such a long time ago. This has nothing to do with me. Why can't I be taken by who Iam--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- rather than by all this? Why do I have to apologize for something that even not my parents did, but maybe even my grandparents didn't? And part of why "m asking these questions is to provide a window to what makes -- if that is the case, or not, you know? Does that -- A2: Let me take that point and narrow it into like a very specific mini-example, cause I understand that feeling. So when we were on this trip, my mother said, this at the beginning, Lufthansa provided transportation, or was part of it, and there was a sizable contingent of people who were kosher, who were Orthodox and kosher.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>And the -- some of the events that someone in Germany catered was, they had to <span class="page-break" number="119"></span> ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion Interview with Dorothea Fingerhood " April 27, 2017 provide kosher food. Well, there are, you know 30 Jews in -- in -- in Fulda at the time, and it was a -- it was a production. And I don't really know how they did it, cause we don't keep kosher, but I think it involved getting food from, you know, further away places. And I remember at one of these events, speaking not to a dignitary or anything like that, just to some -- some kind of a guy who was working --I forget if he was part of the catering, or part of Lufthansa, but he was one of the people that arranged for this food to be provided to the kosher people. And I was making -- you know, I was sort of just having casual conversation with him, sort of, because it was -- I w -- it was just interesting to me that thi-this was like a very -- I was part of this visible, the Jews of Fulda back there. And I said something like wow, quite an event, and I think he spoke reasonable enough English. And he said yes. And he said, you know, it's -- he basically said it's really very expensive, and very difficult to have to get this kosher food. And it's really a big production, and we -- he --I don't think he -- he basically said, we have better things to do.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Ah, so it was with this kind of attitude.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>A2: It was like -- and -- and I don't think he was being angry, but it was very interesting, because his perception was exactly what you were saying about like why -- I'm not res -- his whole perception was, look, I-I'm a young person, I'm not responsible for whatever happened in the past. Somehow or another, we have to run <span class="page-break" number="120"></span> ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion 124</p><p> Interview with Dorothea Fingerhood April 27, 2017 all over the place to get this kosher food, for this group of people that are visiting.</p><p>Why do we have to do this, you know? It's a big -- it's a big --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Pain.</p><p>A2:-- burden. It's a big pain. And I don't get it. And so he was not, at all, welcome back, you know, I know a bad thing happened, we're making a huge effort. It was more like, why the hell am I doing this? And I thought to myself, well, you know, if --if this group hadn't killed, or exiled these people, they would have their own thriving community, they could get their own kosher foods, so it's really the least you can do, to be inconvenienced.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>A2: So -- but there are both sides, you know. I don't know what to say.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><p>A2:1c--TI understand someone saying, we didn't do this. Hell, you Americans, I -- what are you doing for the native American Indians, or you know, or -- that's your promise? And -- so, I'm not particularly persuaded by that point of view.</p></p></dialogue>
