Of course, I played with them, played soccer, but they don't invited us to their homes, nothing. In the beginning. Later, two, three years later when we growwhen the senior class, a little bit closer, but you felt some coolness. Because the biggest mistake was that we didn't left immediately for Poland. And now I will tell you why. When the Russians liberated us we became sol thought I'm a human being, I thought I'm a normal person. Some of our people, even my aunt, she left forrun away because her sons were taken to the Russian Army. And those who had people in the age you could be taken to the Army, they run away to Poland. This was officiallylegally, we have to apply for permit to go to Poland, which my mother did. I remember she filled out some papers. And the post office wasn't working so well but I don'tand we were told that we should send this to Schworchoff (ph). We send it, to get the permit to return to Poland. Because at that time we knew already that this would be a Russian Ukraine and Poland would be Poland. Of course, we feel more comfortable in Poland. But we never got the reply, never. But my mother could have tried to go without some papers, which wasshe was scared probably. And then some rumors came that in Poland, their pogroms, which was through, and so my mother called up, said, Herethere are no pogroms here because the Russians are here. And this was whenbut then we went to school and I don't knowwe were happy with the minimum that we have. But if we would go to Polandfirst of all, life in Poland for Jews was much better. I'm sorry. And from Poland, as we learned later, we could be trying to go to Czechoslovakia, to Vienna, to Israel, because Russia was close. Poland wasand besides, the Poles closed their eyes when Jews left also from Poland. My aunt, with her two sons, left for Poland in order for them to avoid the Army. In Poland, they were + because they were of <span class="page-break" number="20"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> Krakow, too, so Poland was also not the best place to be.
