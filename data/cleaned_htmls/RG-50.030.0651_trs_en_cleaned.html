I couldn't go to school, so this must be somewhere in between, or maybe somethingten year or something. But this was done by Vadel, a Jewish photographer. I knew him. I remember him very well because I used to go to him with my mother, my parents" pictures. But he was killed in "41 so I couldn't understand how this was madethis was probably made between "33 andbut notmaybe in "43. This is hard for me to describe.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uhu.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And I don't! think this was a religious teacher. He was Jewish. Yes, he was feshtop (ph); he's not alive. It seems to me that this gentleman is also Jewish. Is he?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So there were both Jewish and nonJewish students at the gymnasium as well?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, yes. Oh my God, and more Jewish. She, too, had the Jewishtwo other Jewish girls. I don't know. They got a picture from a Gentile and probably theythis is how they indicate the Jews who are not alive probably. + not been someduring the gymnasium was notthis couldn't be of them. Or maybe when this was done, maybe there's just indication of Jews. So for me, it's, you know I asked my mother and she told meof course, she knewshe knew the other one. She knew all the Jews there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Your mother knew all the Jews?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: She know them. She know the teacher. She knew alsol remember she mentioned this: Her name was Flusay Lord (ph). She was a Polish woman, a Polish teacher. But thisbut one thing is for sure, that Vadel couldn't have made this in'43. Was killed. And my sister, if this was in "43, she wouldn't be. Not only, all the Jews wouldn't beso it must be done, the picture, but the occasion, they couldn't come, in the sense.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uhu.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And being in Russia after the warfirst of all, we gotabout two, three years after we were liberated and then we find somebody who made a picture of my sister based on this one. So we have it at home, a big picture. That's what I can't tell about this picture and what her story. She was a very bright girl. She spoke English, she was planning to study medicine somewhere overseasoverseas in the West, not in Poland. She had a lot of friends. She helped us a lot from "41 to "43. She worked; life was very difficult. And after our ghetto was liquidated, we were hiding immediately, and she was walking in the city, in the camp. It was not a concentration camp per se but it was a working camp.</p><p>Jews and Poles work there. You ask me why she was there? She could have escaped with us but she was trying to retrieve some things for us to be able to continue hiding and living, etcetera. Me and my mother and my sister were hiding at that time inby Poles, outside the city, and I used to go to visit her. I remember I visited her twice or three times. She couldn't visit us. And when I visit her the next time, I don'tthe third or the fourth one, she wasn't there, and I remember I was surrounded by Polish girls and Jewish girls. And I said, "Where is Esther?" And they saidthey didn't tell me that she was taken away, of course, and killed probably immediately there. Said, "She went to another place to work." And then I asked, "Can I come tomorrow and see her?" And I remember they told me, "No. If she come back, she'll come and visit you." Of course, in retrospect this</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="3"></span>  was a preludium. It was painful for them, and I was beginning to cry + something.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember when the war began?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yes, remember September 1, "39. Yeah, how well I remember it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And how did other people react? How did your parents react when the war began?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They act scaredthey were scared, normally. We knew thatwe didn't knowl couldn't understand that they would know what the Germans are doing; they would probably run to Russia, from one part. For the other part, we were welloff, and the Russians sent many to Siberia. My auntmy aunt from Gleenyana (ph) they were owners of a factory so they wereher husband was arrested, and my aunt and her daughter Arella was taken to Siberia.</p><p>Unfortunately for them, they didn't survive thereno, unfortunately for them, they survived but they came back in "41. They came back because my parents, many people around spoke about them very highly, positively, and they wrote to the Russian government that they were not for Bourgeois who exploit other people. Can you imagine that? In "41, they letshe came back, and her husband came out from the jail because of intervention.</p><p>Couldn't understand how thisand of course he very, very happy when she came back but in two months laterin two or three months later the GermanRussian war started. If they would stay there, maybe they would survive. Maybe he wouldher husband, Mosha, would have gone to see them, but those + she came back, unfortunately, for them. In "41, my father was killed, and my two uncles were killed, in November. The Germans came to our town in July.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was it like when they occupied the town?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was very, very scary. The Jews were taken immediately, in a very arrogant way. On November 5th, my father and my two uncles were orderedthey got ordered November the 4th by the Jewish Judenrat, the Jewishcame to the same place where my sister went.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Which is the gymnasium?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The gymnasium, yes. Of course, at that time there was not anythere wasn't a gymnasium. I don't remember waslI don't remember what. And from there, the same day, they took them to the woods and shot them. So this was the connection with the same place. Oh, of course I remember very well the Judenrat asked everybody to bring whatever they possessed, gold things, in order to buy them out. We were very naive, naive people, thought everything would + but around 3:00 o'clock I was trying to run to see them butthe streets were empty and around 3:00, 4:00 o'clock they began to take groups to the woods in our city, Snutwasfada (ph). It was a very beautiful place. But the shooting was already going on, we can hear this. And around 5:00 or 6:00 o'clock, women were cryingRoma, Romasand I remember that I wasI gottold</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="4"></span>  my parents and my sister that I'm going toto the place of them, and I went.

The Ukrainian police and the Germansmostly Ukrainianwere they went to the city to eat, to drink, and then they came back to bury them. Not they, probably, it was But then I went to the woodsI went close to the place where they were shot, and I remember that there were some cries of probably many people who were wounded, and I was scared and I run back, and I told the story to my parents, to other people there. So other peoplesomemostly, of course, Romathey followed, they run to this place, and they didn't came back. They were shot also there. So I was lucky that didn'tso this was but prior to this my father +, My uncles were taken to jobs to work.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not so friendly. Not soyou see, they saw what had been done to Jews so everything came out from this. Of course, I played with them, played soccer, but they don't invited us to their homes, nothing. In the beginning. Later, two, three years later when we growwhen the senior class, a little bit closer, but you felt some coolness. Because the biggest mistake was that we didn't left immediately for Poland. And now I will tell you why. When the Russians liberated us we became sol thought I'm a human being, I thought I'm a normal person. Some of our people, even my aunt, she left forrun away because her sons were taken to the Russian Army. And those who had people in the age you could be taken to the Army, they run away to Poland. This was officiallylegally, we have to apply for permit to go to Poland, which my mother did. I remember she filled out some papers. And the post office wasn't working so well but I don'tand we were told that we should send this to Schworchoff (ph). We send it, to get the permit to return to Poland. Because at that time we knew already that this would be a Russian Ukraine and Poland would be Poland. Of course, we feel more comfortable in Poland. But we never got the reply, never. But my mother could have tried to go without some papers, which wasshe was scared probably. And then some rumors came that in Poland, their pogroms, which was through, and so my mother called up, said, Herethere are no pogroms here because the Russians are here. And this was whenbut then we went to school and I don't knowwe were happy with the minimum that we have. But if we would go to Polandfirst of all, life in Poland for Jews was much better. I'm sorry. And from Poland, as we learned later, we could be trying to go to Czechoslovakia, to Vienna, to Israel, because Russia was close. Poland wasand besides, the Poles closed their eyes when Jews left also from Poland. My aunt, with her two sons, left for Poland in order for them to avoid the Army. In Poland, they were + because they were of <span class="page-break" number="22"></span> </p><p> Krakow, too, so Poland was also not the best place to be.

Was not nothing, not a schul, nothing. Nothing. I remember when I came bar mitzva, that my mother took me to Limberg, to the &gt; to a rabbi who lives there. Nothing, nothing. Food was not kosher. I remember my mother was avoiding this. But later, I remember shefor me was not kosher, nonkosher, but I soimmediately after the war I became skeptical about religion immediately. I said, How could God thinkallow such things happen? But, you know, in order to deny something, you have to know it.

I wasn't so convinced of this but she was happy when I came back from the schul, this and that. And became, you knowto be open with you, I know what I am.
