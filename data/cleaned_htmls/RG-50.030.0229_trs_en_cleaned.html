<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Eugenia Szamosi.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Where were you born, Mrs. Szamosi?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I born in Transylvania. In those times Transylvania was Hungary and the name from from the little town, . That is in...later on it went to Roman...uh to Romania and the name was . But I was liv...I was living, if I can say that living several months there and my fam...our family went up to Budapest and I born in 1914. I once before the war, the 1st World War. My father was uh immediately went to the military service and I in Budapest with my mother. I was the last child in the family. It is interesting in this way to continue and my my father disappeared...not exactly disappeared...by the fact by the very beginning uh became to Russia and <span class="page-break" number="0"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: <span class="page-break" number="0"></span> shortly...his was the first. Then it was a second rendezvous, as you say, and I wanted to be very sure...I wanted to cut these connections because this was not the time to to make a connection between a Jewish girl and a Christian boy. Even I told to my mother that I have a rendezvous with a...I will make this very short...and we went sitting in a terrace nearthe _ and some way it came out that uh that there was some little group, Nilos (ph) group, that this was very beginning from the Nilos movement. They were shouting several slogans and I thought that I hate these people and Szamosi said I hate too. And it was nothing to say because not every Christian person was like this uh Nilos movement and I wanted to make sure and I thought because I am Jewish and he was very uh stonish (ph) because I was very uh uptight, blonde and alive and he left, wanted to see every German in this and and he he told Iam I am Jewish too. Then I was very (laughter) astonished, because I was sure that he is Christian and then even he told I am religious and I was very, very astonished that a young person who is going to export on the on the Danube...how can . Uh my company was uh better to say...how you say today <span class="page-break" number="0"></span> go in in the labor camp, but it was always more and more difficult and and dangerous to play this way, and he made some ___ operation like like uh abscess...he got some abscess and uh profits were made on the operation then he was was always able through me to find a way to to pay somebody to help us and there was literally illness then I was able to speak with this physician or professor to pay something, give a longer time for for this illness to___, but every second or third month he got there uh called up to the military service so he find a way...I don't know somebody give this ID...yes...and get and get their ID when he he can go in a in a mental hospital. Then the military uh military uh police cannot take out these people from there, and we paid for somebody a very big amount. It was...1 can't remember...ten thousand penge what made ten months , but you <span class="page-break" number="0"></span> looking for. I wanted to be prepared but it was quite good in this place and it was quite good as long...my my husband came out I think in the..."43..."43 autumn. And it was...yeah...yeah...yeah...then we leaved our quite private life in our flat, but very very often somebody...what is this...somebody's saying against against another person...yeah...yeah...why he is at home, why he is not in the military...in the labor service, and it was...we decided, my husband decided that we will take a a second flat, to rent a second flat uh place far from Budapest near near a famous lake that is a summer place but it was autumn and we did take a villa there with with our little boy and uh later lived there only to visit there from Budapest that the people will forget. And uh not to denounce. It was our place...yeah...till till December I think, uh end of December...we rented this for longer time but uh I was pregnant with Mariam (ph) and I get a very very heavy..uh I have had this, this was , and the pregnancy made me position that in evening I get a back that I was not able to to move, so the next day we we took a ambulance, and we ran back to Budapest and we there in our flat. Our flat was <span class="page-break" number="0"></span> never I was insulted in my life, and I went out. It was a terrible feeling that somebody came against me, very respectable elderly person...like an aristocrat, with a yellow star, and to look each other, you you too. You too. And then please wait to go in the street. It was something about the...in our age, in our lib...liberated uh youth, after our liberated youth, it was so almost impossible to understand that how can people be back in this way and to live in this way, but I made a self-suggestion that it is now my shame. It the shame, it is the shame who made this with me. It was a brainwash but I made for me. I have a little uh story about in this office...interesting. I went in and there was aa automatic elevator. It was a two...two person was going in and this went up five. I went in and nearby was a...well a gentlemen about uh forty, forty-five. He saw star...1 was with the star, and this was a little problem, and he was looking at me curious way and he was asking uh you must wear these or...and then the question was the the _ that I making uh the demonstration near the uh to be sympathetic for the Jewish people but never happen in Budapest, but it was known that someplace, some somebody can make some demonstration. This happened inin _ later. We learned this, so the question was this that you must wear this or , and he was looking and and asked me, have <span class="page-break" number="0"></span> was not...uh we was not running to look. We was a little bit para...paralyzed the first time, but uh somebody was ringing and coming and yelling, so and he began to say that I have flattened this house what will be signed for the Jews and I have heard the conceriege that here is a Jewish family maybe that we can change the flag. I was quite apathetic in this because this was sure that this is not to live. It is only a temporary thing.</p><p>What will happen with us if it is not the place where we were living, and I went this young person. I went in the house. He showed me which uh...attached there is two rooms and the kitchen and the maid's room and came out a person from the house, a young man, good looking young man and he asked me uh madame, will you come in in this house and I thought I don't want to come in. I must come in. He thought come in...there was a good place. I have here a war factory. Uh I am making uh I am making uh noodle and uh macaroni for the military service. Here the door will always will be opened and I have a telephone. And this was not for me. I was not interested in what is this flat. I come back and I told Lotzie (ph)...Lotzie is my husband... find a place. The main thing there is a particular person. He told me that the door will be always open and there is a telephone, and this was very very important and we decided to change the flat. We left this our flat with a lot of belongings there and we take the the minimum bedroom and something that was necessary to this flat and we made a friendship with this uh factory owner. He he immediately take us in like a worker in this in this uh war factory. That was a...that gives a big difference because...uh I cannot remember what was the order that Jewish people from the from the signed houses can go out between eleven or...till one...something like this, for a short time to arrange something or buy something or was survival was to buy.</p><p>But the somebody had these these uh document that he is working in for the military, military service. This gives a longer uh time to to to strolling outside in the street, and this was very important. So it was quite a, quite a good life. It was written...1 was luha person always I was looking the good side. Now we are in one room. The other room is took in uh my husband's uh brother, a physician with a wife and two little children and in the maid's room there was a help for me. She was my cooks and she was looking always after my children, uh a Jewish person, a Jewish woman, an elderly woman and there was living eight, nine, nine or ten person in this two-room flat, but there was living. In uh during this time I think it was May...for that and we got a lot of control. I am not a historian to to...and we had heard that the...in the... what happened in the countryside everywhere and what was the meaning ghetto. That I think there was together and what the meaning deportation. Not exactly...only about. We didn't get any any detail how was this deportation...really mainly I, I wasn't not to think about only the bad things. Always I I was looking what is deportation. To take the people another place to work. Maybe uncomfortable maybe but this is the maximum what uh what I was able to imagine. But we have heard about the concentra...what what is happening on the country. In the meantime I was not very interested with uh Zionist movement. I have heard sometimes from my husband that he is a Zionist. OK. It's his business, and he went always out from the house...a lot of telephones and he hold his horse on connection, but I was not very interested as long...he was....I think we had had a feeling during July...it was continued this deportation from the country and we began to get the feeling that now is our turn because this deportation, this ghetto together...put together the people and put in because <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> it came very very close to Budapest, till the suburbs. And it was a a feeling that tomorrow, after tomorrow our turn is coming. Then uh I think it may be August...we get some some information that what is stopped uh ____ you know, ...uh stopped the deportations. And he changed the government and will be another uh solution but uh what will happen with the Jewish population, so we get a little breathe, and uh to change the government it really means a little more liberal and only to hear the the announced that what is stopped, the deportation, so it was a little bit out from the immediately danger, but I must tell you that I didn't shout that the deportation it is dead. I didn't run to understand. My husband began to speak about this, that you know these people is going to . And I told you are crazy. You are speaking something what is believable. <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> about the the _, it must be something. We hadn't hadn't seen any Hungarian uh soldiers during our our stroll, but it was a fantastic uh several minutes to hear this, but in our our heart it was not the feeling . We finished. After a...it was...as we we had heard this declaration twice in the radio or three times. Then the radio began to give German march music, German. There was no Hungarian. It was German. Then after the music...always very, very military uh music...we had heard voices, a message for uh Nilos uh leader people. There I will never forget the name that and there was a voice,</p><p> please come back. please come back. A very uh prominent Nilos. Then I <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> 0 Tape #2</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: OK. We're starting with the end of October 15, 1943...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. No. Yeah. Fifteen October, yes. And and so this was the big change, all the house, all the population from this house, all the people was on the, on the field. Nobody went to sleep. We was waiting what will happen with us. Mainly because our house was the very first house of the Nilos Nilos government take these sixty, this became the headquarter and we was the very first house in the back street for this corner house, so we had the feeling that when they are making something, then we are the first in that area...the yellow-star. Everybody was standing. We was...like a guard closed the the door from the house. We was looking out in the night, during the night. Even the people pushed there, there was from this war factory, from this noodle factory a truck. They pushed this the door, not because this was something that saved the house, only a feeling something to make. We have seen people on the street, groups, guarded with Nilos uh people with a with a gun. I think it was...they went on the street with hand up, mainly men in the direction to the corner house, this headquarter. Nobody knows why, which kind of people, Jewish people, so this was the first night. Nobody was sleeping and nobody knows what, what will be the next day. There was order that the...after the declaration, a lot of houses...the people went to take down the sign. Naturally their first order was to put, to return the sign, the yellow...the yellow star was quite a big star, about almost a meter big on the on the houses, and the cur...curfew... what is the...and the</p><p> naturally we...that that the Jewish people not allowed to go out from the houses. <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> 1 was October. She was nine years old...big, uh nine months old. Little baby, and my son was two and a half years old, and I thought I don't know where... I'm not able to go on on the street. Where? Where? And he told very very strong, I am going and I will be and he gave me an address, a Christian woman...she was my sister's business companion and uh my sister and my sisters was living in the same house before the...and he told I will be there and there's where you...and he went out with uh with my son. I wanted not to go but he was sure that when he is going out with my son I will blind go after him, not to think. I was putting something in the carriage for the baby and something...] I cannot remember what, diapers...something what I put together and I went with this carriage after my my husband and in this house in a very elegant area from Budapest in the</p><p> downtown, but the downtown was very elegant and I went in in this flat. The <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> 2 sleep, and this was the second night that I was not sleeping for a minute, only to think about what will be tomorrow. How we are....how we can continue tomorrow. We left this house on the second of daylight. Then we find out that this uh...I mentioned earlier that uh this woman where we find each other before my husband was the business company and from my sister. The business was a a lady hat salon. One was in the same house, but another another house after the corner. This was a modern uh shop with toilet and with telephone and my husband decided that he will make his investigation what we can make during that time and he will spend the night in this shop. The woman will close the shop and he will be inside and I thought OK and I am going to look after a flat like a refugee from Transylvania, like a family who was afraid from the Russian and I am a refugee, refugee from Transylvania. I was without any papers. I went with the carriage and near, near the carriages. My son Peter and I went from house to house. I went in to ask the concierge can you find in this house a free room. I am a refugee from Transylvania. It was...I was never afraid that I am suspicious like a Jews because I was very very uh Aryan type and the two children was blonde Aryan type, like Hitler looking. And I went from house to house knowing this was no __ house. The...what can you say that the...it is not right here in this house, not free uh free room to to let it, but here, there is a family, a couple with a child and a very big family and the woman is a very good woman. She is working in the Hungary in the Red Cross. It was not the best thing for me because the Hungarian Red Cross was very anti-Semitic, but she's a very good woman and I am almost sure that if you are asking personally she will give you temporary a room because there is a lot of room. I went up and I was speaking with this woman and she was very kind. She give me in in the flat, there was a room with a bed, a big room, a big...very big rooms, these old fashioned houses. So I get their roof. This was maybe noontime, something like this. I was able a little bit to rest but I was not able, not to eat, not to think about to eat something. I...even I can cannot remember what I gave for the children.</p><p>Surely I gave something. Surely I put something in their carriage. It was in early evening when came back the husband from this woman. They invited us to the uh dinner and I was not able not to eat. It was a little bit maybe suspicious that I am such uh stressed that I am not able to speak. I apologize that I have had from my things I hid all of it and II was able to swallow a tea, and this was...and they were speaking that tomorrow you must uh go to the to the office where all the all the refugee people will gather identification and everything and I put a story that uh I left the same little town in Transylvania from from where my cousin where spent earlier, earlier what I was not and I told I am, I was living in was the name from the little town and my husband is in the <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> 3 Immediately I have heard that terrible screaming and I ran what happened with my little son and a woman saved me. I wanted only to help him to make peepee. I saw that he wanted to make peepee and my son was screaming and I thought oh thank you very much. Will you the help to the to wash, wash the children and I told thank you. I will make alone. She wanted to see the children, mainly my son. Only she wanted to help me.</p><p>She wanted to to make a bath, and I thought thank you, I will make it alone. Thank you. I left to her the little bit to Miriam. You understand what I was meaning, so they went to...I had put the children to sleep and I went to the bed and I had a feeling this is not the place for me. I...and this woman is suspicious. She's looking and and asking questions. This is not s place to remain. And what what how can I make out every day. And I was under in the bed during all the night, not a five minute to to able to sleep. This was the third night without to sleep. And I was thinking and thinking what to make, how to make...I must escape from this threat, because this is a threat for me. How can I escape not to make suspicious that I am running out from a very good place, a very lovely person. The second day I was standing near the window. I was looking out. There was opposite another house and I was thinking what to make out to make the woman __ will you go to the office to to arrange your papers. I can help you. I will go with you. And I told thank you, very nice, thank you, but maybe I am waiting because now it's raining and and I must take the little baby's _a little later, and I was looking out. She was standing behind me. This I don't ever forget, this voice...I was looking out and the opposite house was people was moving and she told me now these people there, and I was <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> 4 face, but one or two persons was coming to me...women...what happened, if you can...can we help you with something. And I began to say I am a refugee from Transylvania, and I get aaaroom the last uh night, but I have I have forgot the name, the address. Nobody was able to help me and I thought OK, I will find...and they began to ask which way, which how how looks like this...and I thought that when I went in there was in the middle was the staircase and something I thought and then I thought OK, I will find. I don't know how long I was in this this panic, but I find the house, but I was in a terrible panic when I went up, and always with my with my son. My son was only near me. This was identification what could be a catastrophe when somebody find out that he is Jewish. I went in in the flat and I told to this woman that uh luckily I find this friend from my husband and he thought that he will come to take us uh to a certain place. Thank you for your hospitality. I'm very happy and thank you, and I went in the room and I began to speak with my son, two and a half years old. And I told Peter , Poppa (ph) will come but you must not make any sign. You cannot cry and you cannot speak. Please not cry, not speak. Excuse me. OK. We came back in our home...if you are, if you will not make any sign. Poppa will be here but you will not men...you will not cry and will not say any word. So my husband arrived. He was uh good-looking Christian person and I made _ this and this. I am happy to see you, and he told OK, I have heard about you and I have a place for you, a ticket, and took your children and they are going...I have a little flat for you, and we escaped from this house. Then on the street I told to my husband that I am not interested in what will be tomorrow. Maybe that we will die.</p><p> tomorrow. I must go home. This home was not the real home, but it was my furniture, my...I thought to be with the best for the children, to go in my bed and to sleep a night and what will be tomorrow, we will die. I don't know. We will see what will be tomorrow. And this was our our way back to this house. In the meantime the population, there were people from the house not happened anything and we went to sleep and the next day to go through in this drama...my husband, early morning he went out but earlier there was a round-up. In the house two Nilos with a gun came in. Every man down to the courtyard till sixty year old with some one day food. They are going to digging uh traps for against tanks, _ in Budapest. My husband went and didn't went uh didn't go down.</p><p>It was...he was young. He was not in this age to be at home like a Jewish person. And I went out and I went uh I told my husband cannot go, and the Nilos asked why. I told he's he's very ill. What is his illness? I told I told he is mentally ill. They told OK, remain at home. So later my husband went out and arranged with the Zionist organization that beginning from this story and other story that uh they are making several children home and my husband came back and told me and earlier whenever I have heard about Zionist organization or something only I have heard that uh in the summer time that when will go a group out from Hungary to Palestine through Romania, we are in this list. This was the whole what I had heard earlier I forget about it. Then my husband came back and he told that there will be a uh children home for is exist. We are...we get the permission to go in with the children and we can work there. And we went. And this was in the</p><p> ...it was a very Jewish surrounding but it was out from the ghetto area, so we <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> 5 something from myself and I take my typewriter because this was my like sin my hand. If I have heard about to work something, it was always in my mind connected with my typewriter. If I am working, I am working with my typewriter because I was not able to make any other work, so I took my typewriter and it was sitting there in an office room like half from this. Zionist people, my husband was uh knows several people from this...I, first time I have seen these people and uh there was some very peaceful uh discussion about uh when we are taking in in this home the children, which way we will educate the children. Uh it was a quite a a leftist uh influence. I think it was absolute curious for me that while __--s Zionist Jews, Jews...what is the difference. What can be different they leftist or...we will... was absolute out from these ___ and my husband was sitting there.</p><p>He was very tight-lipped, tight-lipped. He was not speaking one word. I have seen on the face that something he was not satisfied. Later I learned that this was not the thing what was so interesting to speak about the education, how they are educating the children. So the second day he disappeared and went out and after several hours he came back uh some kind of carriage...carriage uh platform (ph), two wheel and somebody was personally to to pushing this and uh and there was a lot of uh dry noodle from this war factory and uh some some uh margarine, some very important cleaning things, again supplies, games...several very practical things, and he put these in and it was a little bit interesting for the leaders from this group that here is a person...he was not uh saying convert, and he is making what is necessary to make, so to ask the leadership that I have right to buy these or to bring these in, so it was quite an effective uh beginning to work in this in this chil...children home. So in a very short time my husband took in his hand to, how to fill up with children these not to be very care...very careful how many children we can give place or what or which kind of children over. With this, in this time outside from this children home, becomes the the to take the Jewish people all in the all that people didn't...certain area what will what will be the ghetto, but the ghetto was already opened.</p><p>The very old people must go in the in the ghetto. The people till uh sixty must go ina certain place like a horse racing uh area. Women in another area and there was a ina block out on the street. Uh children above sixteen must go with the with the adult people.</p><p>Below this remain in the house. A woman, women with uh with less than one years old baby can remain with the baby in the Jewish house. So it uh produced a lot of children without parents in these yellow-starred houses. Their mother went in this way, the father there and there was the concierge to be responsible that all these people went, left the house and not remained or hidden in the house. So that began to...that meant a lot of children from one, one and a half year till fifteen, fourteen, fifteen and on without without parents. This was the _ first to make this children's home, to bring in these children in a home and this action made by Otto Komo (ph). Have you heard about Otto Komo. He was the president of the Zionist uh Hungarian Zionist uh organization and he was a leader who get the leadership to to save the children and the the how to say umbrella was the uh International Red Cross to give a section and above this was the Swiss Embassy. From the Swiss Embassy the the help gave with their . Later we <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> 6 remember exactly because my husband took in almost immediately his brother's wife with two little children and my my sister-in-law, she told you can be occupied in the office. I will occupied with the children, your children together with mine, and I was occupied in the office. I wanted immediately to make lists about the names. There was children and I told who knows who is these children. Must take out if somebody is in the age to tell the name is OK or an other from the neighbor knows that this is this younger child, what is the name. I was such a person to make some organization, some order, and I began to make some lists who is the children, what is the name, which house they was coming in. If somebody will ask or might be a person, if a person, not a , So this began to be my occupation and my husband went mainly out and he goes...he went in the headquarter from this International Red Cross organization, the children from the headquarter was in the or . This was a very famous uh headquarter for the <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> 7 groups with the white band, they will remain in Hungary, so it was a a mania to learn the...uh I don't know how to say this, praying some very common praying uh in the Catholic uh way and to con...to be converted. And uh when somebody, the men get this uh this paper that he's converting Jews to Christian, then he get this white uh band. A lot of people made these without the without the holy water. Paid something and get the paper and immediately wasinthe _a little bit back uh uh but it was not so very interesting, so then came out the new uh possibility that if somebody has a a shutzpass, what was a...how to say...a document that the certain person who has a a passport from a from a neutral country or a collective passport or something like this, that he get a a document and this name became shutzpass. It is save saving passes, something to translate. The first shutzpass we have heard about from about Wallenberg, but this was a very elegant, very very noble shutzpass. We had heard only that the Swede con...uh embassy is giving shutzpass for people who have relatives in Sweden or business connection with Sweden, or who has had. Hungarian people was very far from Sweden, and it was very ___ when we have heard that somebody is uh have a Swedish shutzpass.</p><p>It was like a like a letter for the lifetime. We was not thinking about to get uh near to Swedish because we hadn't had relatives, haven't had any connection with the...so the the Swiss Consulate begans to give shutzpasses for people who was under under uh...how to say...uh on this list two thousand people who was uh taken in in in a group to go to Palestine. This this group never was able to left Hungary because uh in the meantime...this was, I think the beginning was August or what July...in the meantime Romania made the...came out from the Axis uh not made but it surren...surrendered and uh there was no more possibility to to to make a way through from Hungary through Romania to to the seashore to get a to send a quite a big group to Palestine. But there was this list, and that was a collective passport, like a collective passport and this was the basic to from the Swiss Consulate to give out shutzpasses. So we was between the first uh group to get the shutzpasses because we both , our name, our family was in this uh in this list. The headquarter to make this shutzpasses was in the . This was a house uh what uh created from the Swiss Consulate, because the Swiss Emb...the Swiss Embassy was not uh...it was it was a very tumultuous work, very violent work and it was much better to put in a quite separate house and this became the very famous uh glass (ph) house, this uh . There was uh there uh began to work the <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> 8 right to remain here, and this worked. When a person was still there, naturally it was a possibility that he was sent for another place to work, to make against the tanks or something, so it was not hundred percent and this was not such an organization but was working like a clock work. It was everything was accidentally, so the _ street began to give these shutzpass and several days later we was, we get a a certain amount of papers from this shutzpass that youin the __ street, if you have somebody in danger, you can you can make this uh shutzpasses for the names what when you know this is actually in the danger whoever . We get these papers. It was nice to see and I began to make <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> 9</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You're erasing the name? You're taking...you're changing the name?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. Yeah. To use once more this paper. It was a very careful made work to take out with a...with a to write out the name and to put another name, because it was very <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> 0 Tape #3</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: We have begun. Will you tell me while, please, while you were typing the shutzpasses, what was your husband doing? Can you describe it and how you worked together?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: So I think in this time that I mentioned...we arrived the beginning November...uh my husband was in all the time...I cannot remember that he was sitting in the office from the children home. He was in and out, in and out. Only the night he spent there and very little there together in the same office, with eight other people. Uh in the same time, my husband began began to work...how to say to work, to influence uh his uh business friend from the Spanish Consulate who was the the name Dr. Farkas Zolta (ph). I am saying Hungarian way the name and he was the uh legion adviser in the Spanish Consulate.</p><p>Earlier he was a business client to my husband but they they became so better connected like only business. He bought uh brought from through my husband! office or something something from...it is not interesting...this was a a good business connection and he was uh for sure he was not an anti-Semite. But for sure he was not a Jew. And my husband...this I didn't heard immediately. I learned this after when happened something that my husband had kept a a idea that there is a neutral consulate, neutral consulate, the Spanish Consulate, maybe that they can help like the Swedish or like the Swiss Consulate. Naturally my husband began to to work to for our family and uh he asked some paper that uh which kind of paper can (cough) get Dr. Farkash (ph) from the Spanish Consulate, what can...what we can use like uh a shutzpass or maybe more, maybe a a passport. But this this uh Farkas___ was a very careful person. And uh a real bureaucrat because he was a lawyer. He was not uh thinking about swindle way what to make. He wanted to make something uh what is a in in the frame of the of the law.</p><p>Something what is uh what is looks like logical and uh and uh some . But but the beginning I hadn't heard about this. I was occupied in the children home. My husband was occupied around the town, somewhere from morning till afternoon, late afternoon.</p><p>What he's doing, which place he went I didn't know in those times. Lately I have heard about the Spanish shutzpass, but this Spa...Spanish shutz...shutzpass, it was coming out in a very certain way. People who was before the to uh to to be the dep...deported, when the first time when they get...this was the earlier in the and easier way to get a Swiss shutzpass...I must finish with the with the Swiss because this was uh...originally it was a higher higher and it was possible for a higher number to give about thirty <span class="page-break" number="11"></span> 1</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: There was groups to take from the Jewish houses, groups to to bring to to the brick factory. Several people was able to escape from from the group, but it was naturally not a lot. Then...now I know the connection...(laughter)...[ must make a little order in that...uh there exist already for the for the uh Swede protegees was several houses where out, far out from the from the ghetto area, several houses. These houses in the protected area, protected Jewish area...it was a quite a different section from the and there was on the house that this is protected by the by the Swede by the Swedish Embassy. The same thing made made after this the Swiss to put the people who was bringing back and who was not able to findin__a place to put in these houses, these protected houses, and there was written this is uh the Swedish...this is protected by the Swiss Consulate. Later when more and more people was saved by the Swiss that day my husband and the leaders from this uh movement in the in the glass house, that we can make other houses like uh like uh saved by the International Red Cross. This was a little bit crazy because Swede is uh Spain... is aa state of Inter...International Red Cross is not a state, but we was <span class="page-break" number="12"></span> 2 was a gentlemen agreement, not by in ink and after...I don't know...several days, weeks...every week was a like a lifetime...he wanted to put down this uh in like a contract and we made this contract. I have in my documentation. It was a short contract that uh we are like selling this this piece of land for Dr. Farkash and he wanted a little <span class="page-break" number="12"></span> 3 much, and the Nilos began to uh re...realize that uh it is too much and it cannot be and cannot be uh respectable and uh they began to turn these and go out when they made a roundup, not to accept the...not everywhere but they began to...these these uh tendencies,</p><p> . With the most the more respectable was this the Wallenberg shutzpass, the Swedish, but beginning the most was the the Spanish, and that was a a argument what uh Dr. Farkash used, may maybe some breathe that we are the the...someplace was very flexible and it was not a very difficult thing to to make an influence to help to the Jews.</p><p>He was very helpful. He was not a hard bureaucrat or far not an anti- anti-Semite. So the most res..respectable was the Spanish, because there was an an argument that the Spanish government, the only government he accepted the Nilos government. The very simple people on the street didn't understand what is accepted and not accepted. This was</p><p> something. Gives gives a . The low end was the Swiss uh Swiss uh <span class="page-break" number="13"></span> 4 that this person is help, a worker in the International Red Cross. This was an old identification but he hold but he had had a feeling that this is not very much. He can be choosed with this be...like Komo Otto was a head worker for in the International Red Cross and not and everybody knows that he is a Jew and uh he wanted to get some nomination from this uh Spanish Consulate that he is working in the frame from the Spanish Consulate. Uh this was not an easy thing but immediately my husband wanted to put in Otto Komo (ph) to this position, because he had had an imagination that Otto Komo in a very big danger. He said there's known Jews. He he was working always against the the the the wave to save the Jews, and he was a very prominent person and he was Jewish and all his uh identification like a Jewish leader person. And my husband had had an imagination that he, Komo Otto is in a very big danger. And he was speaking with Komo Otto that uh that come in in the Spanish Consulate. You will be in a safe place, in a neutral in a in a neutral consulate. He wanted not to get these these uh personal uh exception or something, because he thought I am I am legal. I am sitting here in my position legal, absolute legal. But it was...he was a little bit , Komo...Komo Otto.</p><p>He was a little bit uh look in the future that immediately it will be finished and then I can continue my work and to take the these orphan children and uh poor people to send to to Palestine and to make a a make a new home for the Jewish people, but in the meantime there was...the front was closed but to close it was a matter or something, something like this. Nobody knows how long it is for, and my husband beg...began to worry the very very deeply for Komo Otto. Then Farkash often spoke with to to prepare these nomination for Szamosi and Komo Otto. Somebody started OK, I am ready but what is there what is their rea...what is their basic. I must get a letter from , from the International Red Cross, that he asked me to make this this nomination for these two person. It was not a simple uh thing to influence __ what was much harder, a very...how to say, tough bureaucrat. There was...uh Komo Otto has a lot of fighting with the with uh . By the end uh was ready to give this letter, to send this <span class="page-break" number="14"></span> 5 this and this person is in danger, personally. So when they when they get this nomination...this was in mid-...I think after one day, two day the left Budapest.</p><p>And this was a very nice day because there was . He get a breathe that I have no more boss. I must look influential and ask and to and to make the whole the whole ceremony to get something, almost and once more I am I must uh say that he was not a heavy person, ...helped, he was helpful. Uh but it was a very nice uh situation. <span class="page-break" number="15"></span> 6 to say that I am here with the Spanish charge d'affaires in this thing to arrange to arrange to look after somebody who was disappeared from the house, maybe that he is here in this police station or another. And he went every where in the in the children home and the...and to look the the the protected houses for a certain time with Perlasca, but for a certain time. Later Perlasca was not very much interested to to go out because the the whole situation was more and more dangerous plus the bom..bombs because it was more and more closer the front and every day, almost every every hour was uh non-stop bom...bombs. So he was not uh...he left out slowly slowly from these these activity to see the and to take uh food or something. It was not his work. My my husband knows where is the storage from the International Red Cross, where is the food. The food was mainly some margarine, some mainly milk powder but was like stones what was necessary first to to make a powder from this, some uh uh very simple uh medicine and bread. The bread was very important. Naturally it was not in a very hugh amount but uh they made a agreement with a bak...a bakery who was ready I think hundred or some amount of bread to make every every day for the International Red Cross for the uh what my husband parted with the Spanish uh uh protected people to...because these people wanted to get a good paper when will change the regime that they was helpful for for the Jewish people.</p><p>So it was a...to to be protect, to be protected when the change will come, so there was a...I don't remember...I think in the but it is today not interesting that it <span class="page-break" number="16"></span> 7</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: We need, for this interview, we need to talk about only what you knew at the time. Not what...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Sure. In those time I didn't know this. Only I I I know that that Farkash all time was always very very careful what he is making not to make a big uh a big advertisement that we are giving uh even after when somebody's left the house. He was always always very careful not to make a big a big advertisement we are giving out shutzpasses. This was a very secret, very very very uh bad action. I had heard from my husband about Perlasca when when they was very happy to...he was very happy that I have somebody to go out and then from the residents, from the every day residents, slowly slowly went out the name from Perlasca. It was not a...my husband began to be more more uh he get more uh more...he get in more in this in his actions and he went alone. He was not alone.</p><p>Never he was alone. He was putting in the car uh somebody to take from this place from another place, or a Jewish person from the from the Embassy to bring to another to the where is...to the uh uh headquarter to the , or to give several lift to give for <span class="page-break" number="17"></span> 8 when this was the only way and we went in in a house in uh near to the to the Danube, a flat like a Nilos family, this Christian name and and we get this flat. We was living there for a quite a short time. I don't know exactly the date...it was Christmas. On Christmas Day. He is so much lying, so much happening in this very short time that almost I am not able...my husband always ask asked me to write down during the all life time I was not ready to write all this, because I rather not to go in in my head and heart to to live through this period, and I am not a writer. I am only a typist, so this was 20 20th in December. In the in the meantime every...this headquarters for children children's homes...the people began to be less and less because this was clear that this is not a solution for the to be saved. All these children home and and headquarters and this must must go in the ghetto and the ghetto will be closed. The ghetto is already crowded, terrible uh terrible situation. A lot of...very few uh uh food. To give, to help to to supply these the ghetto was Komo Otto's work and several people who was helping for him and the remains the the children children home only with the children. The little children because when somebody was fourteen, fifteen years old, these children was able to find some hidden place alone, and this was an interesting period. My husband get a...I think I never write on and I cannot remember which cloister (ph) was this that my husband went in and asked papers, Christian origin papers for girls, certificates, born certificate or parents uh uh marriage certificate to...some certificate to to make a person Christian. A born certificate. My husband bring these...I can't remember...this was quite a lot of papers and he get these from a from a clo...cloister and began to ask uh younger woman who is about this age, who can, who can use these. This was born in this age, some similarity some similar age, and this paper was enough to go out and to to be to get a job like a postman was not working, postwoman was not working very much in this but the tram...tramway, tram, electric tram on the street...this was working and there was to sold the tickets, the women work, and the the new the Nilos regime is very primitive. Woman became the first persons. There was no more more ready to work in this very simple work. So that was job available, and these Jewish women went to be a conductor on the tram. Get a hat and a something what was absolute perfect the uh identification for a Christian person so this was a a this was a way to to lower the the the population in these very crowded children home. This was a way the individuals disappearing was another way and the and the shutzpass, but already all these protected houses, it was full, full, full with people but it was not a question that people can live under under staircase or someplace, only inside someplace. Ten person in a room. It was not interesting. It was sure that this is not for a long time, but it was sure that this is not a life-saving. It is only a time _. Never I was able to use this that we saved, we saved lives. We helped to survive from day to day, because somebody went with the good shutzpass, went from one place to another. It was very possible that a gang, a Nilos gang took this, these people and took them to Nilos headquarter or another not very headquarter and to began....where are the Jews, where are Jews and to make the torture and and to make the niceuh ____ what was the only occupation from the Nilos uh uh...I cannot say this was not an army...gangs.</p><p>This was the only...there was not very much to to . Only to make the personal hate <span class="page-break" number="18"></span> 9 people when...and so and it was every day more and more terror, more and more brutal <span class="page-break" number="18"></span> 0 Tape #4</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: OK. We're on. You and I were talking before about uh Perlasca. Could you tell me, explain for the interview what we were talking about and how you feel about Perlasca and the roles of your husband?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. So I have heard the the name Perlasca when I... had heard the __-- say we have a charge d'affaires. An Italian. It was...I I think the only humorous part from all the history because there was not a lot of part to smile or...but this was this was a little bit like a comedy, that an Italian can be can be a Spain. I had heard not much, not very much on this in this time about Perlasca. Only my husband, I went with Perlasca, with Perlasca.</p><p>This was a like a safety belt for my husband. And naturally Perlasca went because he didn't know what __ he was not speaking Hungarian, so later, several days...this is the whole period this was quite short, short...I haven't heard so much about Perlasca, but when after during the war, my husband wanted from me to write down in his memory, then he he was always very over-joyed with this person in the right time that that was this Italian that he was able to use like a Spanish, like a a Spaniard, like a charge d'affaires. It was a short time, but every short time it was a question of life and and and dying. Later I haven't heard and I today I know that the only person who write down and give gratitude Perlasca, my husband, in my husband's memory, because all the other things, it is all created, these...it is not not interesting. It is a ridiculous, pompous words and and but here is the fact, that my husband and Farkash was very very thankful for for the to find for the fate to find a person who was playing this role, and other uh very important thing that after when somebody's left their embassy, the the power went to the . He <span class="page-break" number="19"></span> 1 to to take this this uh __ and they arrived in Budapest uh . He was a person...he was he was occupied to be with Komo Otoo and to help to Komo Otto. He was a very helpful per...person, and they made a good friendship, Komo Otto and . Almost every every day they was together. But as the time went closer and closer to the end, my husband was worried more and more for for Komo Otto and he prepared a place in the Spanish Embassy for Komo Otto, a nice, comparing nice office building, uh telephone, everything because all the building was empty. The people who was uh refuge refugee there, Jews or Christian people was under shelter, because almost non-stop was the bomb, bombs. And my husband began to speak very serious with Komo Otto. Come in in the Spanish Consulate. You can continue the same work. You can continue your your connection. There is telephone and and come in because you are in danger in the Ritz Hotel. It is more and more uh shining that he is living such a...he was not a pompous person. He wanted to make in the Ritz Hotel an office for the for the...to send the people in after the war in uh in Palestine. And when, and he was always no...] am I am in secure here. [have here _ and | am in the in the spotlight from the Wallenberg, ,a general come and other neutral uh Portuguese...I don't know the name from the Portuguese. He has had a feeling that he is OK. It is absolute legal in this place. Then my husband began to speak the with the with the wife and to influence that bring in in the Spanish Consulate, so this was a very from my husband because he was looking <span class="page-break" number="19"></span> 2 way to ask questions. Naturally my husband asked Wallenberg to ask, to look somewhere, someplace, some police station, some Nilos uh uh headquarters. No more.</p><p>And this remains in in my husband's life like a a something he was never out from this that he was able to help. He had seen that this that this person in in such a danger, and it happened that he was not able to help. That what he made when he went to Israel. First of all, there was not any credit in his behalf on Komo's name. Nobody was interested.</p><p>Nobody knows about who was Komo, what, what happened. Most of Hungarian people was not interested because a lot of Hungarian people there in Israel is from country or from from Transylvania.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Excuse me. I need to...we need to stay with what happened during the war. You need to tell us briefly what your husband did in Israel, and then we need to go back and finish.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Sure. These these uh this was the most tragic day in our life, when my husband came back home even in our home and he told me Komo Otto disappeared, and then was the feeling that every person, every minute, everywhere can disappear. It was not a question before. No more, no more leader. No more to ask somebody to help. The only person he managed to help it was Wallenberg, and no more other, because there was uh diplomatic persons who was not coming out like it is not a to mention Shalutz (ph). He was help everything but personally he was not going to to to making...to be uh in touch with the Nilos people. He was not ready for this. . Even not "</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You said Wallenberg helped. Uh tell us about Wallenberg.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In those time I was not very in...informed what he is making, only I knowed and I have heard that Wallenberg was ready to go after the people, not only to give a paper and goodbye, you are you are going away with this and help these people, paper 5 Then he was personally ready to to be touched with with the with the brutal uh uh low lower ranking people till the ministers and everybody, and to speak with with the whole uh possibility to the welfare for the for the Jewish people. He was the only person, he was make he made this personally. Not by letter. Not by uh sign a a piece of paper personally. This I have heard. And this was the uh example uh this was like a a...Miriam, help me.... (say it in Hungarian)....uh . (Example). Exactly. This was <span class="page-break" number="20"></span> 3 bring this with. This is another list, and these were these went in this way the work. It was a little period when my husband was ready to go personally to , very risky for a Jewish person, but it was everything was risky, even to live in Budapest was risky. But uh when came out that Wallenberg told my husband you remain here and when the people came back, you can you can arrange from the wagon to to bring back some place.</p><p>Uh Wallenberg sent his person personnel to bring back the Swedish people but there was International Red Red Cross, then Swiss and Spanish. This was...this remains for my husband, and my husband took the people when somebody was able to go on the foot it was there was a very very terrible uh uh situation. These people after the death march and to back with uh with uh train naturally like a like a cattle...</p></p></dialogue>
