<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. My mother took that car when we left, just before the Germans came, I guess.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But it was a large Russian colony. Then the -- I think my grandmother opened a restaurant.</p><p>They survived as well as they could. But then, I think, the Japanese, you know there was trouble with the Japanese at that time.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So I didn't realize how very closely knit, --- the photos ---. Was it because, did your father probably and mother probably had foreign accents?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yes. Everybody had foreign accents. Even me when I was little because my first language was Russian.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right. My father had --. He has a brother whom I met once, who lives now in Munich and who was taken prisoner. His mother came to visit right after I was born and then died of cancer. He has -- my father, I believe -- has an older sister who is in Israel and an older brother. But I don't know anything about them. He never kept in touch with anybody. Except his brother Otto who lives in Munich. When I was 18, he came to visit. That was the only time I saw him.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But it was before the war ended, close to liberation ----?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Very close.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Would you say, a couple of weeks?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I would say maybe less than that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you remember standing in front of the 4</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And they had separated you into 2</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. I remember seeing older kids cry so I cried too.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Naturally.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I remember seeing Francoise walking by and she was very pregnant. That was a frightening time. But again it was not directly personal. I have no recollection of anti-Semitism for instance.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You don't?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I remember playing with them, playing with some of them. I have a feeling that they sort of -- were more or less I guess like the rest of us. We didn't have SS. I think we had young men who might have been just as unhappy to be in France as we were unhappy to have them there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you didn't get the sense that people were particularly bitter about --?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, everybody hated the Boche, you know. I think compared to the stories I hear of what happened in Paris where literally you saw people shot in the street or treated very inhumanely, I think we hated the Boche because they were there, because they were the enemy. But I don't think there were any incidents in our village.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No one died during the war ?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think, the day they took us, I remember my father was walking around with the Red Cross on his arm. He took care of somebody who was wounded, I know that. But I don't know anything else.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But you said that you were released pretty quickly all of a sudden ?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: To me it felt all of a sudden. I don't know what people knew. I remember my parents listening to the radio. You know, we covered all the windows because there were lots of planes going by.</p><p>Now not very far from us, there were blockhouse you know where they were sending V-2's to England? So they were trying to bomb those out, the Allies. But in our village, there was nothing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you heard planes going over, 2 <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I am very grateful because since that time I've heard so many stories. What happened to so many people that grew up that way. That there was more than just the darkness because you have to be living it. I need to keep a view of the world as not entirely dangerous or evil. The fact that we were saved, I think, to me makes a big difference. I'm here. But also not only because I survived physically but I think because it allowed me to survive psychologically and to want to do the work I do. I'm , to me, it's very important to help other people <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection you know you have a child.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, "m--I'm --.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: When I was a child, I liked the church a lot. Perhaps the priest was good or perhaps the schoolteacher was religious and took us but it always presented me. I mean my two -- I was growing up with this guy with his big beard of course and sitting on the clouds and___--swas rather stern. But then there was Jesus who loved little children and took care of all of us. All we needed to do was to be good. That was simple enough and Jesus was very forging and understanding. There was the Virgin Mary and it was a statue and she was so beautiful and she was wearing this blue cape and her hands were around, with such a sweet expression, that I was very attached to that aspect of the church. I felt safe. I always felt | would go to Heaven. I was pretty good little girl. But one time, I think in front of my mother, I crossed myself, she was furious. Because, of course, I can't understand her but it was difficult for me to accept what she stood for because it made no sense to me. I remember sitting in the synagogue and there was -- we were sitting up on top -- because it was a conservative -- and so I was looking at the head of the men. I was looking at this rabbi who was short and had a beard and kept moving back and forth and kept talking and talking and talking and talking and . Then the women in my <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's interesting. Is there anything else that you want to tell? You told me about ?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I remember the store, Francoise had the store and she was selling everything. You know, cloths, candy, buttons, margarine, we had no butter, whatever, she sold it in her store. I remember looking and there was glass in front of ---. She kept things behind the counter and then there was glass like that. She had two children too. I would go to her house every day and I would look at the chocolate behind the glass with such longing. She said I would like to give you some but I can't because everything was rationed. So I was thinking of this chocolate so near and so forbidden.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That would be a ----. So, in Paris ---.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In Paris, so I went to church. No, I did not go to church. I wished I would go to church. I was the only Jew in my class. All my friends went to church and then they had First Communion.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What kind of a school did you --?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: B.C. ?? You know it was First Communion or Second Communion and they had those beautiful dresses, all in white with veils. Oh God. And I wanted so much to be part of that. To have a dress like that, to be beautiful but, of course, I couldn't. I finished school.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember any anti-Semitism at that time ?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You know, I have a feeling that I wasn't about to deal with that --- I have no memory. It seems unreal that I have such a ---.</p></p></dialogue>

So he was French?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, he was American from Iowa. And his family came -- they were Huguenots that came to Iowa very many years ago. So he was a little more French than me. He may have had droplets of French blood.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You were both members of persecuted religions?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The connection.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And we had two children whom we did not bring up in a religious way.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Where were you living?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We lived in Cambridge for six years. My husband was going to Harvard and I went to B.U. and got a degree. Then we came over here. We had two small children then. He came to an age during the Vietnam War so he wouldn't be drafted. Then we divorced in "78. I stayed for many reasons. The main reason was not to separate the children from their father and not to break their life completely apart by starting not only with another father. We stayed close -- we always stayed close. With another father, a new country and a new language, I thought it's bad enough for kids. So we had an agreement who would stay around and we did. We remained put until last year. Last year, my ex-husband moved to Atlanta. I stayed around in Washington.</p><p>I started a private practice after | divorced which was not ---. As I grow older, I feel more and more Jewish. My daughter considers herself Jewish. My son, not. She's working in Tucson with Russian refugees. You know, the Jewish refugees. She's learned to speak Russian on her own. Myson --. So she does pretty much the work of a social worker or a psychologist, a mother. My son has studied industrial psychology. He's now working with a firm with -- in the area of handicapped but in a -- how big firms deal with handicapped people -- with sexual harassment. I guess I am still struggling with where I belong but it seems like more and more I feel that I -- I feel a Jewish identity but not religion .I am less and less a believer. I don't think I believe in God any more. Unfortunately, I can't believe in Christ any more which makes me sad but he was too much of a childhood. It's like a fairy tale now. It's a man, not a boy but it's a fairy tale and one day we have to give him up.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, why -- what do you think ?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They were with Jewish. I always had my Christmas tree. Good question. It's more internal.</p></p></dialogue>

I don't know, to me it feels like it's something that I cannot avoid. It's where I was born, who 1am. Maybe just wisdom that you're better off just being more what you are rather than fighting it. As I get older. It's not a terrible source of comfort to me unfortunately, but there are no others that I know, that would be any better.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. Well, is there anything else?</p></p></dialogue>
