<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="15"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We went every day, we took a little bit out, you know, from the apartment.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I'm going to take a quick break. Okay, we were starting to talk about you beginning to go into hiding, and I wanted to make sure I understood approximately when was this? How long after the anschluss? Was it a year or two after, or -- or sooner than that? Do you -- did you go into hiding in 1938, or was it later?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Later, later.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Think it may have been closer to 1941, does that seem right?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I thinks that would be 1941, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, from 1938 to 1941, were things getting more and more difficult all the time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And are there any examples that come to mind? What -- what sorts of things were happening?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Life became very complicated for us, you know? Everybody know when you went to the street, you are a Jew, you know? And it was -- and we lost all our apartments, I told you that already. We pushed together in small rooms. It was complicated, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you actively trying to leave the country?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yeah. I was supposed to go to Venezuela, I told you that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But after that didn't work out, did you try other things?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Then you couldn't go. We waited for papers who never came. You could leave if you have the papers, but it never came.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And then at some point you started looking into the option of going into hiding.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And your husband was mostly in charge of looking for those arrangements?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="16"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, you already told me a little bit about receiving some kind of order, a relocation order.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>What did that say? What was the relocation order that you received?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I didn't receive it. They started to -- people started to receive it. [indecipherable] my mother too, I told you, to come with so and so much for relocation, and they went to Theresienstadt.</p><p>From there they came later to Auschwitz.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I thought you said you and your husband also received a relocation order.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Then we went in hiding.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So when you received your -- the relocation order, what did it say? How long did it give you in order to relocate? Was it very short period of time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't remember.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I guess what I'm curious to know is, did you have to go into hiding very quickly?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think so. But we already knew, and we were prepared to do it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So does that mean you moved out of your apartment entirely?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. We left, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So the first place you went into hiding in 1941, can you give a physical sort of description, whatever your memory can recall.</p></p></dialogue>

And they never came, because they were arrested in the morning.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I think actually we -- we haven't talked about this yet during the interview. Maybe you can explain wh-who are these family members, or who are these friends you are referring to. Can you tell me a little bit about your friends Ann and Ignatz?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My friend Ann?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did you meet them, or how long did you know them?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes, because you started to talk about her brother, so I just wanted you to give a little introduction to both of them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So when I saw her the first time, she was 13, and her father was what we call a person -- they came from a small town to Vienna, they were relocated, and he could do everything. You want to sell, he knew who buys. You want to buy, he knew who will sell. So what we needed was money, and he knew somebody who would borrow money for a lot of interest.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And what happened on that day?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I wanted a -- we should be all together, but her parents never came because they were arrested in the morning.</p></p></dialogue>

They learned to write, to read, whatever we could ba -- husband was very highly educated, and he is -- whatever we could, you know? We taught them, of course.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So do you feel like during this time in hiding, were there also times where things were not as, you know, heavy and worrisome? Did you have any lighter moments?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. We were worried all the time. You know, you -- you are not worried all the time, that's impossible. You forget yourself. But w-we were not really peaceful, no. We were hopeful. That's different. And we always made it, you know.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, you know, when she wanted something, Pukas, we have to give it to her. She did not stop. So it was a holy day and she wanted a goose. And finally we got the goose, but we had to pick it up by the [indecipherable] station. There was a stand for papers and cigarettes, and she had the goose. And we had to go there, was very dangerous. Debbie's mother and I, we went there, a-and there was the goose, I had the canvas bag, and the goose went in that canvas bag, and there were Gestapo and gendarmes, but we finally made it, and we left. And there was a dog [indecipherable] after that, he smelled the blood in that canvas bag, and we were running to the streetcar, and we finally made it. You know, we were so afraid of that dog, that somebody will notice it. That was very funny. When we came home, and Annie got undressed, she had a blue sweater. Her skin was all blue. Was not -- at that time, nothing was colorfast, like today.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: At the time now you're -- you're laughing about it, but were you very worried at that time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Sure, I was worried.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="24"></span> </p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you worried -- were you wearing the Jewish Star of David at that time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. Oh God.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you were trying to pass as non-Jewish?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Sure.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did anyone ever talk to you and say anything to you, and indicate that they thought you were Jewish?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. I knew that -- that one for the -- for the two girls, Fishbach, who -- who hads the -- that garden that he had all that vegetable, and so she knew. She never said anything, but I am sure she knew.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was there anything about your appearance that made it easier for you to pass in the streets as non-Jewish?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, I-I didn't look like Jewish. I was blonde, I have -- my hair was golden blonde, it was very light. No, I didn't look like Jewish, no.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So do you think this was very helpful in allowing you to go in the streets?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p>End of Tape One, Side B  <span class="page-break" number="26"></span> </p><p> Beginning Tape Two Side A</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Marianne Windholm, conducted by Amy Rubin on November 18, 2005, in Manhattan, New York. This is tape number two, side A. Okay, I'm going to continue asking you a little more about your time in hiding. And I'm wondering, during this entire time, I have the impression that you first went into hiding in 1941?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And -- and you were s -- you stayed in hiding until 1944. So a lot was happening during this time, and I'm wondering what did you know about the war, and what was going on.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We knew everything. We listened to the British sender at night, I told you. We do -- we knew that attentat which, you know, there was supposed to be attentat of Hitler? You know that?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So while -- I -- I knew that you were listening to the radio before you went into hiding, but even while you were in hiding, you still listened?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And was that -- you listened right in that little building?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. We had the radio, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So what were your conversations mostly about while you were in hiding? Did you talk primarily about the war?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="27"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That I should remember. Of course. We spoke about the war, we spoke about what happened, how we did live. We spoke about what will happen. Then we had the children, who didn't learn anything, so we had school every day.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you feel like you were becoming a -- a sort of mother to these children? You were taking care of them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I f -- I did feel very near to them. They boy was very young, you know, of course, and Annie was 15 years younger than I, so -- so Annie, I were more a friend than a mother. But to her little brother, I did feel like a mother, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you ever talk about sort of strategies about how you were trying to survive this entire time? You know, walking out on the streets, did you have strategies where you would go, how you would walk?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I only noticed one thing. When I was liberated by the Russians, you know that -- you know I was liberated by the Russians?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That Ic -- noticed that I was afraid to go on the walk part. I was going on the street, til I said to myself, are you crazy, you're free. You know?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Are you saying you didn't want to walk on the sidewalk?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, I was afraid, like I'm not allowed to.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Because that's how it was in Vienna?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That how I did feel.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So as you walked around Vienna, when you would come out of hiding from time to time, how did the city feel to you? What were the differences? How did it change?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I didn't feel -- I wasn't tired of being in Vienna. I was in Krakow, in Poland.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="28"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No, I'm talking about while you were in hiding. Weren't you s -- in Vienna the entire time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah, I was in -- always inside [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So how did the city change during those war years? Did it feel like a different city to you?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. In later years, when I was living in Italy, and I came back to Vienna, everything looked to me so dirty, so broken down. That was later on.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, what about air raids during the war? Did you experience those in Vienna?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: When the air raid we -- well, when we were hiding by those people [indecipherable] when the air raid came, everybody had to go to the basement. And their apartment was in the fifth floor, and we went up to the attic to hide. And there, Bushie, he was afraid of the little mice. Oh God, he -- yeah, we did hid in the attic til the air raid was over.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you're saying there were mice in the attic?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, there were mice, yeah. And Bushie was so afraid of them, terrible.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you afraid too?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. Of little mice? I don't want them in my apartment.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, I think I heard another story, and I'm not sure exactly the details, but something about a man and the bathtub, the water in the bathtub. Is that a story that you remember while you were in hiding? I think it was a man who drank the water.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's not me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay, I -- I guess I misunderstood something I think Deborah was telling me, but maybe I just got it wrong. So that doesn't sound familiar to you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Absolutely not.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="29"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you have any other people who came and joined you during hiding, or was only the four of you at all times?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Only the four of us.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And did you feel like you always trusted this woman who was keeping you in hiding?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. Only her boyfriend, he needed money, he started to ask money. We were afraid of him.</p><p>And that what -- how it happened.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So while you were working in this laundry, did you have to make sure that nobody else would see you? How difficult was that? People in the neighborhood, were you worried about that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: There were next to us, thi -- there were -- this was a cottage, you know, and there were private houses. And there were people we knew. I don't know if they had the -- maybe they had some idea, but there was no danger.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell me a little bit about your training to become a nurse, I believe.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. There was a doctor, Dr. Richard Miller. I was already liberated then, and he trained me, because that Roosevelt Hospital in Vienna was not a hospital, it was a orphanlager. There were people living -- children without parents, parents without children, the [indecipherable] was bumped, and he trained me. Dr. Otto Vulcan, he trained me, to become a nurse, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So this is -- this is much later, this is after the end of the war?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, while you're in hiding, what were some of the dreams or hopes? What were you hoping would happen, that you would still leave the country?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Beg your pardon?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What were you dreaming could happen or would happen, that you could still leave the country?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="30"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't think I wanted to leave the country. I wanted to be free.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So while you were in hiding, were there any other -- did you just think you would stay in hiding the entire time of the war? Was that your strategy and your hope?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My hope was yeah, that it will not take a long time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now tell me about the day when -- when they came and found you where you were in hiding.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>What -- what exactly happened?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We were away -- you know, I told you, from time to time we had to go away to stay with other people. They called us we should come back. We came back around five o'clock in the evening, when everybody was in the street. At four o'clock in the morning the Gestapo came, and we were arrested.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you have any idea about who -- who told the Gestapo that you were there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think her boyfriend, who always ask for money.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you think this woman agreed to let him do that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't think she knew.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, as much as you can remember the details, what exactly happened when you got arrested?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, we went to jail. And there was already a lot of women who waited to be tr-transported to Auschwitz, but they were in quarantine. There was some sickness. So Mrs. Green and I, we were outside, and we did work. We cleaned the floors. Then the -- they did give us bread. We had to distribute that bread between people. And we did work there, and we were living in the open place.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now where was that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was [indecipherable] in jail, in Vienna.</p></p></dialogue>

Not out on the street. You know, the people are locked in, we were not locked in. We could move around on the floor.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And what were you thinking during this time period?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I was very unhappy that they caught us.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you know what would happen next?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yeah. I knew. We knew.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You knew specifically that you would be sent to Auschwitz? Or perhaps to somewhere else?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, we -- to a concentration camp, I did not know Auschwitz. To a concentration camp.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So while you were in jail, you felt there was nothing you could do about it, you just had to wait?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But I wanted to make sure that I had a -- some information even before we got to that point.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, I forgot it completely.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="56"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Well, thank you for showing me. Now, when you were in Auschwitz, did you and others around you, did you ever have any kind of religious observance? Did you try in any way to -- to observe --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, no. Only to Yom Kippur, they didn't give us any food. They said that this here the day where you fast anyways, you don't -- so you don't need any food.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And that must have been very difficult in the conditions you were in. Now -- now tell me more about liberation. If you can sort of walk me through that time period, what you remember, and sort of set up the scene for me, what -- what exactly happened?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was sick. I was very sick. I had a mer -- an infection in my right leg, and I have very high temperature, and it was very dangerous to go to the revere. That revere was the s-s-sick station, where sick people went, because they made selections there, you know, and killed people. But I had no other choice. I was very, very ill. And it happened that I was absent mind, I know that.</p><p>And then, I remember only that it was raining and I did feel the drops from the rain on my face.</p><p>And I opened the eyes, and there I saw a man with the sickle and the hammer, was a Russian soldier. He held me in his arms, and it wasn't raining, he was crying terribly. That when we -- I was -- when we were liberated. And the gates were open, people went out, you know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was the next thing that you did?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Next thing? I was there for a long time. I actually couldn't go. Then finally I became well enough. And there were three sisters. They spoke German and Polish and Russian. And they saids to that -- no, there came a rus -- Russian man, and they said they will take us to Russia to -- to get well again. And there were three sisters, they told me, we are not going with them. You want to come with us? We are going home. They were from Seidenbergen, well a -- this a tar -- part of Europe. And so I went with them, and we went over the mountains, oh it was terrible. It</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="57"></span> </p><p> was March, was snowing, cold, but we went, oh yeah. Took us days and days, til we came someplace, and that was dangerous. We slept on the street, like where the -- you know, the -- where the bus station is, there was little houses where I could stay and wait for the bus. And there a man did find us, and he said, "Are you crazy? They are looking for Jewish people. If they find you, they kill you." And he took us to a place where we were safe, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did you travel over those snowy areas, the mountains?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: By foot. Later on by coal [indecipherable] the tickets, were train with coal, so we were sitting on the coal, and went with the train. You could go wherever you want. You didn't need any passport, any nothing at that time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: First of all, at the time of liberation, what was your feeling, what were your emotions? Was it hard to believe that this was happening?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Beg your pardon?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was it hard to believe that liberation was really happening when it happened? What were your emotions at the time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I was relieved, I would say. I was happy. And I couldn't wait to come home, but it took a long time, because the war was still going on. We were already liberated, but the war was still going on. There was a time, finally when I came home. Oh God, took a long time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell me about the rest of the journey, how you got back home.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, you could take a train, you didn't have to pay, you know, I told you that. I was sitting for days on the train with coal, that I remember. It was bitter cold, yeah. It was very, very cold.</p><p>And finally, finally, I came home. And when I came home, it was night, and I was on the train, and they took us right away, whoever was in the train, they took us to a place that was a cellar in a building. And there they did give us some to eat or drink. I wasn't by myself, there were maybe</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="58"></span> </p><p> with me, 12 or 14 other people. And they did give us some tea, not made from tea, from something else. And in the morning the curfew was over, and you c -- you could go out. And I went out and I did noc -- I did not know where I am, where I was. The buildings were bombed. I had no idea in which district I am. It was terrible. But then I went to this Jewish community, and there -- everybody has to go there to say, I'm alive.

A displaced person camp, the hospital, start working in the hospital. I met a doctor in the street, which I knew, after the liberation. He said to me, "What are you doing?" I said, "I am doing nothing." There is nothing. There is nothing. Like nothing, that doesn't exist. You come tomorrow morning to the [indecipherable] hospital. But that wasn't a hospital, was a displaced person camp. There were parents without children, children without parents, and they waited to go someplace. I div -- I start to work with him in the [indecipherable] room, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>

I run after them and they went into the</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="65"></span> </p><p> washrooms and that water was flowing. There was water and water [indecipherable] then I woke up Annie, we went every night, we washed from top to bottom with ice cold water, but we keeped ourselves clean, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You never had hot water?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. Hot water? Oh God. We were glad we had cold water to wash.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, back to Vienna after the war, it sounds like you spent a considerable amount of time in Italy, and then you had returned to Vienna on the weekends, and about how long did -- did this go on for?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Every weekend for a long time, I went back to Vienna.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And how long did you stay in Italy?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Italy I was a long time. One year in Milan, and two years in Rome.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Why would you --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: lT--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- why did you know you didn't want to live there any more?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I wouldn't want to go there. I -- I told you I went there [indecipherable] I wouldn't be there, no. I was there once, after the war, on a trip to Europe. No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Why? Is it -- was it just not the same?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="66"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I wouldn't want it any more. I -- first of all, I love a -- America. United States, and I loved Italy. But I hated Austria, oh yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: After the war, when did you make contact again with your friend Ann Price -- Ann Green?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, she was with me all the time, for a long time. But then we were separated. And I, very soon, was liberated, but she still was not liberated where she was. They had a selection, she went on transport, and I did remain. That was the night where they gassed all the Gypsies, yeah. Killed them, all the Gypsies.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Had you known some of them personally?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So when did you meet up again with Ann after the war? Was it in Vienna?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I suppose so. Was in Vienna, yeah. She's not from Vienna, you know, Ann Green. She's from the little town Noyen Kyrklund. She's not Viennese.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But it seems like at some point you -- you met up with her again, and you became good friends again, right?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, we were. She is much younger than I am, you know that. She is 15 years younger than I.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But it sounds like the two of you were very helpful to one another.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you think it's largely because of that friendship that you were able to make it through?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, yeah. I told her, when we came to Auschwitz, and she came to me very upset, showing me she had in her panties, in the seams she did find a louse. So I said to her, "Annie, listen to me, if I will take care of your lice, I will not be able to take care of mine. You will not live and I will not live. If you will listen to me and do whatever I tell you, maybe we will make it." And that how it was. We went every night, I woke her up, let's go and wash, because then the water was</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="67"></span> </p><p> flowing. We had never water when we came home from work. But at night we had no towel, nothing. But we were undressed, we washed from top to bottom, yeah, every night.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were there a lot of people who did not wa-wash so regularly?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yeah. Sure, there was no water.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So you made a --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: [indecipherable] the selections, as you know, wi -- you were not -- you were not hundred percent clean, I mean clean your skin, they were afraid of sicknesses, and you were gassed, sure.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you made a special effort to stay clean?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yeah. I knew it's important.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now it sounds like you and Ann have reminisced, you know, about your experiences together.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>Do you often talk about your experiences?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. We sometimes laugh about, you know, there were funny things too, who happened. So we speak about it, we laugh. But we normally, no we don't.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you think it's too difficult to talk about these things?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Sure, it's still too difficult. If you were in Auschwitz, you learn how to steal. You know, everybody likes to survive. So whatever you see you could steal, you steal. You don't have a bad conscious if you do that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What about your memories, even if you weren't speaking out loud about them, do these memories come to you a lot of -- of these experiences?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. Sometimes I do think about it, but I didn't think about it at all because my life was full, you know, after the war. I had a good life, I was happily married. But now, sometimes I do remember, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you allow yourself to remember more, or do you try to block some of the memories?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="68"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I still like to block them out.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It's just easier that way?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, sure.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now tell me about your journey coming to the U.S.. How is it that you came to the U.S., and when was that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: What happened is, I was in Italy, and there was my brother, who always wrote and said everybody's here, everybody's here. No you -- why don't you come, why don't you come? I was so happy in Italy, but then I went to [indecipherable] and I had rheumatic fever, I told you. They had put 30,000 dollar down for me. And then I went to the United States, and then I went here. It happened my brother even didn't -- excuse me -- live in the United States. He was living in British West India. Yeah, I had nobody here.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When did you arrive?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see here that somebody wrote down 1952.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's could be, yeah. That's could be. Yeah, 1950 fi -- I became a citizen 1955. Must be nine -- 1950. After five years you -- you become a citizen, no?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I believe that's right. I'm not sure, maybe something was different at that time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, even though your brother wasn't here, you decided to come to the U.S., why?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because he s -- said I should come. And then my disappointment was terrible. He was living in British West India.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So where did you first arrive in the U.S.? Did you take a -- a boat, and where did it -- where did --  <span class="page-break" number="69"></span> </p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you on your own, or did you have any family or friends?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [had friends, yeah, I had friends. Have no family here. My brother then was living in Venezuela -- no, my brother in British West India, my cousins in Venezuela.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: As Ise --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: But I started to make money -- to earn money and I was happy, yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What kind of work were you doing?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Whatever I could. First of -- I was crocheting, and then came that I had no money left, that week was over, I hardly make money to pay my room.

I called my brother, and I said, "I am not going back any more. But what will happen to me?" He said, "You are in America. Here you  <span class="page-break" number="70"></span> </p><p> don't have to go back. If he asks you why aren't you coming back, you could tell him, I don't like the color of your hair. There's no explanation. You don't want to, you don't go." And then I took a job outside New York. No, then I took a job at -- I met a doctor -- oh God -- then I met a doctor I knew in Europe, and he was a Sephardic [indecipherable] in Brooklyn, all the way down. He said come and work with us. I took that job.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you feel a greater sense of freedom in -- in the U.S.?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I did feel absolutely freedom. You know, the first time, after a long time that I have f-felt that lama free person.

But in the end we all went.</p><p>Friends of mine, we all went together, and very soon we were married, yeah. Was a Friday holiday, he said he could get downtown, cost two dollars, get married, and then we have four days as a honeymoon, yeah.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So what happened when you got home?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: When I get [indecipherable] home, where are the chickens? I said I throw them away. I was afraid they were still alive. So did you know, at that time, nobody took anything. Was different times.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you get in trouble?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. I didn't get in trouble. My mother was a wonderful person.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So [have just a few additional questions I think --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Okay.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- I think -- not that many questions left to ask you, but a few. And I'm wondering, was it difficult for you to adjust to normal life after the war, after the Holocaust?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. Was difficult, yeah. Was difficult, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In what ways?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="72"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In every way. You know, I told you, I did find myself walking on the street -- I was afraid to go on the boardwalk, you know? And took a long time to come back to a normal life. When I started working, that did help me a lot. I was busy, and you know, I had very little time to think about myself. I was tired, I started to sleep good, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: How do you think -- how do you think your experiences during the Holocaust affected -- affected you afterwards, affected you later, decisions you made in your life --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, what should I tell you? I tried to live a normal life. I was happily married, I told you that. I lost my husband, I was very unhappy. I had a boyfriend later, I was very happy again. And then, when he passed away, I said, I don't want to cry after men any more in my life. Now I will stay by myself. I lost a lots of people I loved dearly, and that what it is.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Are there certain things about -- about your experiences during the war, during the Holocaust that -- that really directly affected things that you did later -- later in your life? Decisions that you made, life choices? Do you see the Holocaust as having affected those decisions?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, this is a very complicated question. I tried very hard to start to be an -- End of Tape Three, Side B  <span class="page-break" number="73"></span> </p><p> Beginning Tape Four, Side A</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Marianne Windholm. This is tape number four, side A. If you could just continue with what you were telling me.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: What did I tell you? Yeah, of course the biggest shock for me was to lose my eyesight. But I am a very lucky in one respect. I have good people around me whom I love, and they are good to me, and I am good to them. So I tried to keep a normal life, that is it. I watch television -- I watch -- I listen to radio, I listen to television, and of course, my life is different than from a normal person, but I have to cope with it. There's nothing what I could do.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you ever turn to religion or prayer?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The Jewish holidays?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was that something that you just didn't feel connected to?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I did grow up in a house where every holiday was kept. We had separate dishes for Easter, beautiful dishes, and we kept every holiday, of course. But now I don't keep anything.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you think the Holocaust had any effect on your thoughts about religion?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't think so. I still say oh God. You know what I mean?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="74"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Have you ever given thought to the question of -- of God and the Holocaust, if there's -- if there's a God, how could the Holocaust have happened?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, it's not the first time. There was the Spanish Inquisition, there was a English Inquisition, as far as I remember, I don't know. I am correct, I suppose. And this is not the first time that happened. We are still, after the Chinese, the oldest people on earth. The Chinese are older than we are.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Even though you -- you did not observe the religion, did you stay very connected in your identity, to Judaism?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, I never say I'm not a Jew. That what I say [indecipherable] now. Some of the [indecipherable] me in the building for Easter and ask me, are that your holidays or ours? So I said, "You want to know if I am Jewish? I am."</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Have you ever had any dreams or nightmares that go back to the time period of the war?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. I don't think so.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And when did you start talking more about your experiences during the war? When did you start to do that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I never talked about it. With whom?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Like with Debbie, or with, you know, any of the people you're close to.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Normally I only start to tell them what is funny. Funny stories, yes, nothing else.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you think it's unusual that -- that you're able to -- to capture those funny moments? Do you think a lot of people would not remember the funny moments?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: How could I know what other people do? I never speak with them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But it does seem like the humor is very important to you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: To me, yeah. To me, yeah.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="75"></span> </p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And how do you think your memories have changed over the years? Do you remember less now, and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, no, my memory is good. I have a good memory.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you feel like you remember the same -- same things over the years?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: About -- about the Holocaust, about your experiences?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I remember how I -- how I learned to steal, you know? You learn -- you learn everything in the concentration camp. You learn how to steal, oh yeah. I run after breakfast. I always had two breakfasts, when they did bring the milk by in the morning, I waited for them by the [indecipherable] pass by and boom, took some out. Had to drink it and run back to the block to have my second breakfast. When I did something wrong, they didn't send me to work, so I will not get a second potato, but I had to go to pick up the potatoes, somebody has to go. I have so many potatoes, oh God, yeah.
