<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Fanny Aizenberg on April 21", 2011. And Fanny, first of all, I-- like I do on every interview, I would like to thank you for giving our -- your time today to speak with us. But unlike every interview that we do, where normally I ask -- and I will be asking this later, I usually ask someone to start at the beginning, where were they born, what was their family like, who were their mother and father and so on. All of these things are very important. But I'd like to start ours in a little different way, because before we started the -- the interview itself, we were talking about the process of it, and you were ac -- you were telling me about some of the reservations that you had. So I'd like to talk about that a little bit, about what is it like to speak with someone about these experiences that we are going to be talking about today. If you could share some of those thoughts with me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: For me it's very difficult to talk publicly, because of many reasons. I have heard many wonderful speakers here at the museum, but all those people have been single people when the war started. I already had a child, and I already had responsibilities.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="0"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Fanny Aizenberg " April 21, 2011 And we -- it started out scary enough, and my biggest problem also is, after so many years, I'm still living with the horrors I lived through in Auschwitz.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, in other words, every time you talk, there's a cost, there's a cost.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Absu-absolutely right. Of course it is. Even today, which is so many years later, when I'm in a car, and I pass where there's a railroad, I still break out in a sweat, which is not the polit -- polite way of saying. Because we had been for so long in the cattle train and I don't think anybody has ever been able to find words what it was for three days and three nights, for 110 people, including babies, in a cattle train.</p><p>The prayers, the screams, especially from babies, is just indescribable, at least I cannot find the words fer -- to describe such unhuman things.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Do you think --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And we didn't know what was waiting for us at that time.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were there -- were there many years when you didn't speak about your life at all in -- about this -- these aspects of your life?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I've only start -- what is it, Steven, 10 years?</p><p>S: Ten years ago.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Fanny is talking to Steven Vitto who is [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, when he was always -- and I was very lucky that my job was to sit with Steven, because of his kindness, of his generosity and caring. Don't forget, Steven, not because he's a young person, we are from such a different background and we  <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Fanny Aizenberg deg April 21, 2011 used to have conversations, like one human being should be fortunate to have with another one.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell me of -- tell me a little bit about this, this is -- you started as a volunteer here at the museum, is this what you're talking about?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And how is it -- and what was Steve's job? What was his way of meeting you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>What was -- how did your interactions start?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, it really started that I saw in "The Jewish Week," which is a small magazine --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- advertised that the Holocaust Museum needs volunteers. And one way or another, I was debating for a long, long time, and there's a lot of things which I didn't care for to come here. And I have decided I want to come and see what it is.</p><p>And I am -- was interview by somebody, which we connected very nicely. Her name is Jill and I don't -- Coynburg(ph) or Cohenberg(ph), I don't remember her name.</p><p>And somehow, we had a conversation that we understand each other. She said, look Fanny, you could start here right now, or you could wait for about two months when we have a orientation. And I knew that if I would wait for an orientation, I would never come back.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You knew yourself well then --  <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Fanny Aizenberg deg April 21, 2011</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So she say you could do -- yes, I could change my mind. I had many reasons for not wanting to come, like I had many reasons to do come.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What were some of the reasons for not wanting to come?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: There's a lot of things I didn't agree the way the things were working here. So I had the choice and I did not wait to be oriented. I felt I had been oriented a lot, through the time I was -- the Germans occupied Belgium and being in Auschwitz, that was enough orientation. Anyway, I was very, very fortunate, I met Steven, and immediately we connected very nicely. At the same time, I was translating a book from Belgium, who just came out. This was a no -- official book, how many transports they had from [indecipherable] how many people in each transport, how many people made into camp. What many people didn't know, that many trains had gas and people were gassed in that train before they even got to Auschwitz.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So as you were coming to -- to work at the museum as a volunteer, you were also translating this book at the same time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes, bes --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I'd like to stop -- excuse me inter -- for interrupting you Fanny, I'd like to bring Steve into this shot a little bit. Can we do that? Is there a way for Steve to stand right here?</p><p>Q2: Now, you want a two shot, I take it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: This looks like -- this is two people in one shot?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Fanny Aizenberg " April 21, 2011 Q2: This is a two shot.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: That's a two shot -- Q2: Yeah, yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- yes, at this -- while Steve is in the frame, then yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>Q2: Keep it on the two shot?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, keep it on the two shot, okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>Q2: Okay, that sounds good. All-righty-roo.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: We're ready?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>Q2: We're all set now, uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. I'd like to introduce Steve Vitto to our conversation, Fanny, and I'd like Steve to explain a little bit about what his job was here, and how it is that the two of you met and interacted. So Steve, tell me a little bit about what you do, and how it is that your -- your path with Fanny's crossed.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>S: I work in a department that was then called the Holocaust S-Survivors Registry.</p><p>We've since expanded, now we're called the Holocaust Survivors and Victims Resource Center. And my job then and my job now is to ensure that the individual experiences of Holocaust survivors are first recorded in our survivors registry and then made available to people who are asking about them. So I bridge the gap between researching archives, but always interacting with the public in s -- to find  <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Fanny Aizenberg deg April 21, 2011 out what happened to an individual and to help ensure that an individual's experience in the Holocaust is recorded in some way.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: By recorded, do you mean put in a database, or do you mean that like we're doing an interview with Fanny right now?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>S: It runs the gamut, the primary focus then was the survivors registry, which is survivors or their families providing that information to us, since most people who went through the Holocaust did not have documentation of that experience. So, to fill in that gap, we want people to come to us and provide that information that's otherwise not available, and then we put that information into a database that can then be accessed by people coming through the museum, or calling us or writing me for that information. That's one particular database and since then we also work with many other databases, including oral history collections, more online databases, digitized and also scanned image databases.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So tell me about how it is that Fanny and you first met.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>S: Well, we work in a registry, we work with su-survivor volunteers who come to us and they're very important, not only in giving us their testimony, but in helping us to arrange, put in data, to scan images and to help us in a variety of ways. And so Fanny came to me as a volunteer from -- she had mentioned our volunteer coordinator, Jill Weinberg, and Fanny was able to do several -- working with computers, she was able to pick up using our survivors registry. And we often get  <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Fanny Aizenberg deg April 21, 2011 requests not only for individual information, but information based on place. So for instance, all the people who were from -- in Theresienstadt for instance, concentration camp, or from a particular town, or share a ca -- particular experience, and with our database, we're able to push a few buttons and so we can get not only a list of individuals, but individuals from a particular place. And I had a particular request for people who were -- somebody wanted information from those who were in Theresienstadt, who were registered with us. And Fanny was able to help me to --I could set her up and so she could look through this list and produce it so that I could filter it a little bit and provide that information to another individual. That was one database. The other infor -- information -- the other job she had was, since Fanny speaks Belgian, we have a book that's a list of the deportations that took place in Belgium. And this particular collection is based on date, date of convoy only. And also, it was producing. It was Belgian, so it was in Belgian.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Excuse me. I think in Belgium we have French and Flemish, as -- as languages, so -- S: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So which language was it, of those two?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>S: This is in French, okay, you're right, you're right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It was in French, okay, sorry.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Fanny Aizenberg a April 21, 2011 S: But because of Fanny's background in Belgium, I thought it would be a good fit, and this -- this information was in French, and Fanny looked through that. And before each -- it's divided by convoys, before each name list of those on the convoys is a description of that convoy, and -- in French. And Fanny was able to translate those introductions, so that now people could not only look up the names of those who were on those transports, but they could also read, in English now, that general description of that transport.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But cle -- thank you, Steve, because I -- I --I think we needed to get a sense of what was the structure of the volunteer program, but clearly something much more happened. This was the specific job, the specific task, but when you met, something much more happened between you. And Fanny, can you tell me what it is that you f -- that you felt and that was an ongoing thing over the past several years?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because mainly, little by little, I was telling Steven my background and my story. And he was kind, very tolerant, and listening. Also, when we got the book from Belgium, further descriptions, the number of trains, the number of people in the trains and how many transport, at the same time the museum got a book called "The Hidden Heroes." That book was written by a German reporter. She is from Germany. She tried to interview peop -- Jewish people in Germany and nobody wanted to give her any information. Somehow, she was so determined, she came to Belgium and she got the real information, with the names of the people from the  <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> Interview with Fanny Aizenberg " April 21, 2011</p><p> underground. The underground, the resistance, they were also called the solidarity, and they have pictures right here from that. So that book, and the one I was translating made more sense because you could put the two and two together. And that book wasn't selling too well, and they had -- she had to change the title, to "The 20" Transport." And what makes it so interesting, that in the book, in that what made in Belgium more people survive, because the underground, Jewish people, non-Jewish people, any kind of people were just one group. Where in France they had a separate group of French people, a separate group of Jewish people, and the same thing has happened in Holland. And this is why in Belgium only, because of such a dedication of so many unbelievable, brave, wonderful people, I can't even find the names, who organized in convents, in churches and regular people, because of their caring and their dedication, 40,000 Jewish people have survived in Belgium, including my own child.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's amazing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So you see that combination, it was so wonderful that Steven was there for me to help [indecipherable].</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So wou --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And many of the words from the documents from Belgium, I did not know because I didn't learn English of those documents. So Steven would -- made sure I have a special dictionary, to have those [indecipherable] what anybody who wanted  <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Fanny Aizenberg " April 21, 2011 to know. Another thing what we did is anybody passing by on the second floor, you just seen people running back and forth, specially young students. So we really -- my job really was, can we help you? And we did, because once we had a French person who was sent from a newspaper in France, with the picture from the room where you have all the pictures there, and whoever he asked, they didn't know what he wanted. And he passed a few times, til I had enough guts and I asked if I help you?</p><p>Then he said in French, nobody knows the answer. And he had a copy of the picture and the name of the newspaper he was representing. So immediately if not sooner, Steven was able, through the computer, to get the -- all the information, which he typed for him to take. So he didn't have to go to so many places, because he was originally in the right place. So you see, you never know the contact you have with Steven in that particular place, because he knows the answers to everything.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, it -- to me it sounds that here when you started volunteering -- I don't want to put words in your mouth, but this is the sort of thoughts that are coming into my mind, is that there were aspects of the larger story that was relevant to you because it had to do with the Belgian underground.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Youre right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That you were finding out through this work, and that through the work and through your interaction, little bit your own story was coming up.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Exactly, you're right.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Fanny Aizenberg 8 April 21, 2011</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And is -- and is that what made it more comfortable for you to now speak?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, more than just comfortable, because I had the hard time when we came to America and I was still young, nobody from the family wanted to hear any of our stories, because they were afraid they gonna have a headache.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: That must have been --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So this was somebody I just got to know, and I felt comfortable -- there's another word which is just more than comfortable, at ease, and we could talk, which is so unbelievable, which I haven't done to such extent. Because this was always bottle up and still is, to many extent. [indecipherable] was very, very fortunate, and the same thing, thanks to Steven. He made sure that I would be speaking up. He said, if you don't do it now, when you gonna do it? And I know I'm old, so I had to do it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>But it just amazing how two people from such different backgrounds, different lives, have been able to have such a wonderful relationship.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Steve?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Which is gonna be for me forever, because we could talk about so many things and I'm very fortunate to have a young person who could understand our situations.</p><p>So that's why I say --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Steve, we're putting you on the spot all right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I'm not. He knows I'm not.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Fanny Aizenberg " April 21, 2011</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So ever -- so I --if I ever get a gold star, it belongs to Steven.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Steve, is there something you want to add to this, of your thoughts in the years as they've gone by, what you've learned from Fanny and through the relationship that developed between you about her story?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>S: Oh my God. Well, the first thing I wanted to say is I br-- I wanted to push Fanny, because we did develop this personal relationship and I'm very fortunate in my job that I'm able to interact with the survivors and their families individually, and I meet hundreds of them, thousands of them for 20 years now, but Fanny is os -- really special. And again, one of my profe -- jobs is to ensure that the stories of individuals are remembered. And so, while we had great conversations, I didn't want it to end there. I wanted to make sure that other people were able to hear her story through oral histories, read her story. I always get her -- want her to write out her stories, do presentations as much as possible. And so in this way, it's sort of my job, but to make sure that her story is heard by as many people as possible. She has so many things to teach about -- I guess mainly for me is overcoming. Someone who's been through so much, and by listening to her I understand as much as anybody can, what she went through. And knowing her family, the main thing is about overcoming that.</p><p>You go through so many things and sometimes there's no answer to them, you just have to wait things out until they pass. And you're affected for life, but that horrible moment does pass and you have to rebuild your life afterwards. And Fanny was  <span class="page-break" number="11"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Fanny Aizenberg (r) April 21, 2011 able to do that. So I knew her story, but I also met her daughter and I got to know her granddaughter and her great-granddaughter. And so I see that for the horrible things that Fanny went through, four generations later, there's a beautiful 12 year old girl that's a friend of my son's actually. And I see that if it wasn't for Fanny just persevering and going on, that's -- if it wasn't for that, this beautiful 12 year old girl would not be there, would not be friends with my sons, and would not have the freedom to go to school and enjoy life in a way that Fanny wasn't able to later on in her life.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Thank you. Thank you very much. And we're going to continue now with let's say, the usual part of our oral history. But I thought it was very important --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I think so.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- that we -- that we would be able to --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because -- I'll you why I feel it's so important. It's very difficult in this time and age, with technology that's so advanced, to such extent you have little ones with the -- the computers, the cell phone, just name it and it's growing bigger and bigger, that people still could have a personal relationship, and feel good about themself, that they have somebody else who could understand their feelings or what they're saying. Another problem I had is because of the things I went through, I always felt --and this is still with me today, because it took me 50 years to be able to talk about  <span class="page-break" number="12"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Fanny Aizenberg 6 April 21, 2011 it, and I still have a feeling of inferiority, that I'm not like other people, which "m not.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Because you suffered? Because you went through these things?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: As if they're -- you suffered because of something you had done, and that's -- that suffering made you less of a person rather than more of a person?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Uh-huh. This is because what has been done to me. You see, at the museum here, I am the only person who went through medical experimentation. I'm the only volunteer survivor who was already married and had a child at the time. So I had the responsibility, which is so difficult to make other people understand. This is why when I speak to an audience here, and when you feel the reaction of the people, like you did when you heard me talk -- you know somehow it's like a soothing medicine, or like somebody pats you on the shoulder and said you okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, from -- from what Steve said, not only you're okay, but you inspired others and were able to form a family that now, and that effect of -- of your decisions is felt four generations later.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Mm-hm, he's right, absolutely. It's true.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Thank you -- S: You done with me?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I think we're -- I think this part -- this part is -- is done.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> <span class="page-break" number="13"></span> Interview with Fanny Aizenberg " April 21, 2011</p><p> S: It's all yours now.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Thank you. All right, thank you very much, sorry you get [break] So Fanny, now -- are we o -- should I start? Okay, okay. So now I would like to go back to what we usually do in the beginning, and that is starting at the beginning.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I'm glad you have added to, because this is why it made it important for me to come to you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Thank you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: To come --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And it's because of Steve, I know, that we're speaking today, and I'm very grateful about that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I'm glad you have added that, because very few people are lucky in their life to have a relationship --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: --as his and mine was.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And is.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It still is, I shouldn't say was.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: As it is.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He thought. But that was okay, it was nice and like I say, we were really having big dreams and big hopes at that particular time. That was1938, not knowing what's waiting for us. And also, in November of 1938, there was Kristallnacht, killing the Jews.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In Germany.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In Germany and in Austria. Breaking windows. What they also did, and there's a book about that, the Germans were surprised that in different cities, the population would not be against arresting the Jews. What they did, and I think there's a documentary here on the fifth floor -- they have treasures right here on the fifth floor for anybody --</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- yes, and they have many recordings or documentaries. And they have like a judge, or a surgeon dressed in women's clothes and parading in the streets. They had official rabbis cleaning the streets with toothbrushes.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So that must have come as a shock when Kristallnacht happened in 1938. How did -- do you remember how it is you found out about it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Don't forget, we still ha -- we had our radios at that time, and we knew. And also, right after Kristallnacht, 2,000 Jewish [indecipherable] came to Belgium, and they formed a Jewish organization, J -- AJB, association of Jews in Belgium. And they have arranged of Jewish families to take in child. And my mother and father also had sheltered a little girl until 1940.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was her name?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because the same organization picked up the children and put them in other -- the reason we got -- why -- how come from Germany, we would have to take her off the train -- not that we mind taking them in, because in "38 we were still innocent, because the parents would have to work in different states, so those children needed a home.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, in other words, the parents could no longer work in the same place in Germany, they'd have to work in different parts of Germany, and no one was there to take care of the children?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But we don't know if those parents have not been arrested.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Ah.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was she older than you, or was she younger than you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: She was younger. I think they would --</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right. Very hurt, not quiet. Very hurt, very hurt.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So she was traumatized?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, because she was an only child, and probably extremely spoiled.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What told you that? Why did you think that?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh. So they were, you know, in other words, maybe she was totally unprepared.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>No one was really prepared, but -- but someone who came from a privileged life would be far less able.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Right.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Which we never know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It's true.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Including myself. You never know the -- the reaction.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So this was your first taste of what was going on in Germany?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember, were there discussions about that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Then the discu -- everybody was a politician. You know, coming back Friday from shul, or in the morning after shul, this is the only topic. And also, another thing what has been happening, many people from Austria and Germany, young, single men came to Belgium and that's how we connect and we got to know many of those people. But they didn't know, they only knew Kristallnacht. And they felt it's gonna  <span class="page-break" number="35"></span> Interview with Fanny Aizenberg *deg April 21, 2011</p><p> go away shortly, and it's not gonna continue to the way. And of course, then the Germans started to arrest the Jewish people, beating them, putting them into jails and never knowing what has happened to them. And that's what I feel, it was the end of the civilization of Germany. And I tell you why I say that, because in Belgium, if a family had a lot of money, and especially having boys, they would send them to Germany to study, because this was the ultimate of an education. But of course, afterwards we have learned what those educated people were able to do.</p><p>And we became very friendly with those people and that's how we got involved, and we got to know those people who have joined the underground of the solidarity or the resistance, whatever you called it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So it was through the refugees coming in from Germany and Austria -- I want to s -- go back and then I'll talk about this a little bit. When Kristallnacht happened, you had just been married a year.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you pregnant at the time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, she was born in March "39.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you have any thoughts when -- when your daughter was born, of --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Any trauma?</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="36"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Fanny Aizenberg * April 21, 2011</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah, or -- or -- or fear of what -- what were --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, because on the radios, on the ne -- in the newspapers, Belgium is gonna be free, you don't have to worry, we gonna be free. We not going to be occupied, that's what was used. And of course then we were almost reassured, because of the Maginot line. And like I say, then everybody became a politician, and we believed the papers. And we did believe, because we felt reassured with friends, having the Maginot line, til it became, you know, a sad story, cause they went all around.</p><p>Imagine such a big army, only 18 days they lasted. And France was occupied.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: What -- do you remember what -- where you were on September 1", 1939? That's half a year after your daughter's born. That's --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: A year after?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No, half a year after?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Pm sorry?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: September 1*, 1939, half a year after your daughter is born, is the invasion of Poland.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, this is what started us really being scared.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because, since we were told that Belgium and Holland are gonna remain free, the Belgium government asked people to si-- young men to sign up. They didn't know for what and for where, and many, many have signed up, including my  <span class="page-break" number="37"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Fanny Aizenberg " April 21, 2011 husband. Also many people who have come from Germany and Austria have also signed up. And they, in 1940, when the Germans invaded, they all got the call where to meet, in Dunkirk.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So your husband signed up to be part of the Belgian military forces?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, we didn't know what they're gonna do.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Many for military -- don't forget that afterwards we have learned that in England they had divisions of people from different countries in Europe. Some have mixed with the British and many have remain independent.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, in other words, when Germany invades Poland, there's a mi -- mobilization effort taking place in Belgium.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Wa -- we didn't know it's gonna be a mobilization.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We only thought in case of need. Those were the words, in case of need.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But signing up, what did that mean at that point? Did that mean your husband left the house?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay, it just meant he registered.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In case they would meet and we felt well, maybe, you know, to be at the borders.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did your life change much, your own personal life, after the war started?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It did, because the fear grew so bad.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because here we were living peacefully, and really innocent, completely.</p><p>Innocent is really the word you could use, because we couldn't believe anything could happen, because even when the young people who came from Germany and Austria, didn't know that Jews were killed, they only knew Kristallnacht, they only knew the damage they were doing. But they didn't know what was happening to the Jews at that particular time already.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And the fear grows. When the war starts, the fear grows.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Tremendously.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: How would --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Because we didn't know what to expect. How do you put that in words?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It's really being scared for your own shadow.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Your parents -- it sounds to me, and correct me if I've misunderstood this, it sounds your -- like your parents were very much part of the je -- Orthodox Jewish community.</p></p></dialogue>

And of course you stayed in line in this small grocery store, wherever they had food, they had. And that's where they come and examine Jews.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In those places you have physicians or doctors, whatever you call it, with medications, care and food for the child. There was one lady by the name Madame Louise who was kind and generous and giving me once in awhile food for Josiane.</p><p>But it's so unbelievable today to realize that those kind and generous people were risking their own lives, because if they would be caught, they would be shot on the spot, no question ask. They have a monument in Brussels, with two people who were trying to run away, and they were shot by the Germans. It's hard today to think of the courage and the bravery of so many kind people. There was no money involved, there was no glory involved. Here on the fifth floor, if you ever have a chance, see that documentary of five people. There's two priests and three women, and they were ask -- because thanks to them who started to organize it, that we had 4,000 Jewish people who were saved in Belgium.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And it was easy for them to find out who has a radio, because you had to register your radio and you paid like --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Oh, I see --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- you --a fee, or taxes, whatever you call.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You're cut off.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- because today you have so many gadgets of communication, so there's not the problem, and that was our biggest problem, that we were cut off completely from the rest of the world.

And just to give you an idea of the importance of the radio, when we got married in 1938, part of the family got together, in order to be able to buy us a radio. My parents didn't have a radio, because it was too costly. So how you explain to young people today -- I always mention that, and once when I spoke to another place, one of the teachers had slides that in German this -- they did that, take away the radios. But my son-in-law Freddie, who is from Austria, he said --he lived in an apartment building, and he said he was not 10, because at 10 he left already for England, and he said they had a German neighbor, and he got a radio, because that's the only way you heard Hitler's speeches.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, it's very hard for a person to imagine to be completely cut off, to have no means of communication, not know what the outside world is. That's so not the current kind of experience that most modern people ex -- have, you know? It's -- you have to make an effort to be cut off, to go away and turn off your computer and turn off your mobile phone, but it's your choice. It's not taken from you.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Okay, first of all it started out that the Germans in big trucks passed different neighborhoods with loudspeaker and announcing of the different rules they gonna have. And if we are not gonna obey, we gonna be punished. The first assignment was to take our radios, to bring them to a different destination. Then also the Jewish organizations has had our yellow stars, which we had to buy. We also had to collect our food stamps, and with those stamps you are allowed to buy whatever any store had available, but you had to have the food stamps in order to buy. The Germans started to -- and people lined up in different little store. Don't forget there was not like a big shopping center or a big food market you go today with the list and you  <span class="page-break" number="66"></span>  Interview with Fanny Aizenberg " April 21, 2011 buy whatever you need. You could only buy certain thing. And in Belgium they still had small stores, and each stores had different products to sell. So you know one day this store is gonna have certain thing, and that this day another store is gonna have the -- have thing. And the Germans started to check the people in line, and you never know who was gonna be checked, and you never knew which store is gonna be checked. So you see, our fear -- there must be a better word than I use, fear, because it was more than just fear. Because you were just looking in the side or on the back of -- if somebody is following you. And another thing what the Germans did already in the beginning on, in Belgium they had street cars. There's an entrance and an exit, so what they were doing, one soldier at the exit, one at the entrance, and in between time to check people. They started to do that at the end of 1940.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Fanny, as this -- as th -- as -- [technical interruption] Okay. As the months went by, how did it come -- occur to you, how did it come into your mind that maybe you had to give Josy away?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, that was not til my father was taken away. That really made up the decision for me, if I wanted or not.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I see, so --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because I could never imagine if that's a possibility. Somehow I felt those people would be protected, and I didn't know. So once my father was taken away in deg42, I really had absolutely no choice, but I still couldn't make up a decision.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: With your sisters?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So -- what did your sisters do, sh -- her -- she had two boys, yes?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: At that time she had already three.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: She had three boys.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. And before she went to work in the basement of the church, they took the three boys away in hiding. Because the same group who put them --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- in the particular job, they had them.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Her boys?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You know, even putting a child in hiding, you still didn't know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Of course not.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because we didn't know anything. And another thing, we were not allowed to know where those children would be put into hiding, because in case we would be  <span class="page-break" number="69"></span> Interview with Fanny Aizenberg " April 21, 2011</p><p> arrested, or stopped, we used to call it, we would be beaten and probably give out the names. And that was the reason of not knowing --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So wa -- yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- where the children would be.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So in some ways the -- your sister had already done this, she had already given her children to the --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But it was differently [indecipherable]. Don't forget, she was with her husband through the time, so there was two people deciding, and they couldn't keep the three boys together if they wanted to go to work.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see. T -- in the resistance movement.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: In the resistant movements, and their job was in that basement, which they haven't gone out from deg40 til the end of 44 when Belgium was liberated. They were making false papers. They were also making exchange of ammunition. People knew where to deposit whatever they had to deposit and pick up what has to be pick up.</p><p>Even without names this was -- that's why it was so difficult, and that's why Belgium was very lucky that the resistant, with Jewish people and non-Jewish people had been working together. And because of that, and the dedication of so many brave and -- and kind people, so many, like I said before, 4,000 Jewish chil- children were able to be saved. Don't forget among the children saved were also children who came previously from Belgium and from --</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="70"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Fanny Aizenberg " April 21, 2011</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Germany.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- Austria and Germany.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah, yeah. So wha --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: So for small country, the more you think about it today, and the more and more people study the history of that period of time, it's hard for them even to imagine the possibility of people, who knowing -- they had big signs or posters on each corners, if we find a Jewish person, the person's gonna be shot for hiding a Jew. And they did that, killing people. Some teachers have been arrested because they were -- it's -- it was easier for them to hide some children. So it's really unbelievably like a miracle, you would say --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- to be able to save that number of children in a very small country, because Belgium is about the size of New Jersey. Food was rationed and there was no money exchanged, and pille -- people were willing to risk their lives.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But still, when it comes to your own baby, I can't -- I can't imagine it, being a mother myself, I can't imagine it, particularly when my child would be so young.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Unbelievable. I still today have the pain of her crying and leaving, can you believe that? You ca -- it's -- you can't say that, because we didn't know if the decision we made was right or not.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And whenever she got something new she used to come to my mother. And she didn't speak at that time, but she was just showing her, like this.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Her new clothes. And was this the first time that she had ever been with a stranger, even?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's correct.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So she had never seen strangers before, everyone in her world, she had known?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Correct. Except the two ladies who came, and also friends who came til she was three. So she had seen people with me, and people with her.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But the first time she's taken by somebody -- so why would she cry? Why w --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because, number one, she didn't want to leave me. Not only crying, screaming, she didn't want to go. And also, she was not allowed to take a toy, because we were  <span class="page-break" number="72"></span> Interview with Fanny Aizenberg " April 21, 2011</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> -- you know, we were afraid in case somebody would see somebody with the child and the toy, it would become suspicious.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you know the ladies who took her?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, never met them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. So they really were strangers.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Completely, to both of us.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember what they looked like?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, I think I would recognize if I would see them today, because this is so impact in you subconscious that you see -- like I'm sitting now and talking with you, I still have heart-beatings of that period, of that moment, just her leaving me and crying. They were lovely, nice ladies.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were they older, younger?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think they were older than me, because don't forget, that was about -- very young time for me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You were like 24 - 25, something like that, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>

[indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did they seem kind? When you met them, did they seem kind, or did they seem --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They had to be, otherwise they could never get the child, otherwise the child would cry or scream all the way, til they would be someplace. And another thing which was very difficult, because we were not allowed to know where those children would be taken, because in case we would be caught, and by beating, and of course you would tell anything, no matter what.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was it in the daytime, in -- at -- in the evening? What happen -- was it in the morning when Josy was taken?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was daytime, after lunch.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: It must have been aw --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I guess they were waiting, you know, for the child to be fed. You know, everything was just like when you think now, it makes so much sense of the actions or whatever they were doing, on such an important time, or unbelievable time in our lives. Or undescribable words, I can't find words of describing such a trauma.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: How do you -- when did -- were you alone afterwards, or did --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah, that's why I collapsed.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You collapsed after.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's why I chose in the movie I was telling you --  <span class="page-break" number="74"></span> Interview with Fanny Aizenberg (tm) April 21, 2011</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- about that schoolteacher in Poland who was saving children.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So-</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And they showed in that documentary, how one of the mothers, and she took away her child, how she collapsed and couldn't breathe and couldn't move for a long time. Because you -- there is -- for me anyway, there's no words I could describe such emotions. They're painful emotions really, unless there's another word. I really don't know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did your mother and sisters know that this would happen?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, only my mother knew.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see. And did you --</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I waited a few ta -- a few days, because I was not able even to move. This had such a impact, which is still with me today. I still hear the cry. And I had no way of helping her. It's not when you have a child and falling and you take the child and you kiss to make good.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: That was not what you could do.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="75"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Fanny Aizenberg &gt;&gt; April 21, 2011</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Couldn't. You couldn't do it. When you were able at least to start functioning again, how did your life go on?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: How you call functioning?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Functioning means you got up, you had something to eat, you started to invol -- you know how did your life pick up after you gave Josy away?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It just didn't pick up.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It couldn't pick up, because li -- you all lives, it's not the same life you had before, because all of a sudden you just one, and you don't have a child to hug, or a child to hug you. So this is the hardest thing. You really have to try to continue breathing or continue living. Thanks.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When you need another [inaudible] I guess what I want to ask is, what happened to you in the days and the weeks afterwards? What -- how did your life continue?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>What were the events that took place in it?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It continue and started to worry us more. Don't forget, like I told you, my father was already taken away and the whole concept of life is already different thinking.</p><p>What's gonna happen within a minute? We don't know, because we were like chased, like you chase a dog sometime, and we didn't know where the drop would be. We didn't. Because it just seem according to other countries, that in Belgium they were a little different, the Nazis, because they knew that the Belgium people  <span class="page-break" number="76"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Fanny Aizenberg .deg April 21, 2011 would help us -- much help it would be available. Although in Belgium we had an organization, the black shirts, who were working with the Nazis and helping the Nazis deport the Jews, because many of those people who have denounced the Jews, whatever it was, in the house, in their place, it was taken by the Germans. And anybody who has denounced the Jews got part of that -- whatever they were able to steal and take away.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So there was an incentive? There was a --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Only if you were that kind of a person.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- of a person.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But then again, how could you put the two together, when you have so many people of any background, of any religion, who were willing to risk their lives, just to sha -- to save one child?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It was in 1942 then, what month was it that your father was arrested?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In the month of August.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And when -- what month was it that you gave Josy away?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think it was October.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, as 1942 go -- you know, comes to an end, are you still in Brussels?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And how did you get fed? Did other people go and -- and bring you food?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, we tried to get food.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: As much it was possible, and as much we try not to be caught. Because this is what the Nazis did, they organized. And they had a documentary about two months ago, from France which is called the raffier(ph), which really means the round-up.</p><p>How they have collected and taking the Jews from France, which was the same order as they did it in Belgium.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, in 1943 I went into hiding. My mother was working in a old age home, and she was able to stay there. But being in hiding I -- I was hiding in a small farm, which was run by an elderly couple.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Network, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see. So you took streetcars?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. And sometime I used to meet my mother, because loneliness, not having my mother, not having my child is like my whole soul went out of me. I don't even have the proper words to express such a despair, because we didn't know if the next day is gonna be better.

Your sister -- your older sister is underground, at least in the church building, working on -- in -- in activities that you didn't know about at the time. You say that you come from an Orthodox family, did you feel yourself to be very religious?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was very, very confusing, with many questions and no answers.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you feel like your faith in God had been shaken?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Completely silent because you can't convey a pain in you which you can't express, because nobody would be there. Like when a child falls and you just kiss it for better, and then it does get better, but we know that nothing is gonna get better and we didn't know how much worse it's gonna get for us.

But that we learned after the war. And our -- my loneliness was to such extent that when I met my mother, we decided we gonna stay in the attic overnight. And I guess this was a bad decision, because either we were followed, or somebody told on us, because that attic has never been touched and nobody ever has been taken out. Don't forget, some of the people were there for few year -- for two years at least, and it has never been discovered.

But they were part of the German army in Belgium. They were called the black shirts. They were called the Grell(ph), because he was head of that department. And he fled when -- after the war, and he was condemned to death, because he has denounced many non-Jewish Belgium people in Belgium.

And when they had a certain number, they were transporting those people, and we didn't know to where or what. And I think this is why it scared us constantly, is the fear of not knowing. Because I think we young people, if we would have even suspect what hell is, we knew it from reading, but we didn't know the real existence of hell, I think we would all killed ourself, if we would know that there's such a hell as Auschwitz.</p><p>After three days -- oh, and then we all got the number which was hanged on our neck, with the number, and on our cattle train there was --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So you were put from the truck to a -- to a train station?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, from the truck we were taken to Malines.

The worst thing was the cries of the babies. And finally we arrived in Auschwitz. It was pitch black.

But while the soldier was ma -- walking down, I slipped over to be with my mother. And I was hit over the head, if I tell you to stay here, then that's what you stay. And that was the last time I saw my wonderful mother alive. Then we had to form lines, and from the line I was on, we were taken to a freezing room, and we had all to, in front of soldiers with their dogs, we had to undress completely. And I tried to explain to you that we all came from decent home, and we have never undressed in front of strangers. Not only because we had to get undressed, but we were checked if we were hiding thing in our private parts.</p><p>After that long wait, we were given uniforms and wooden shoes. Then we went and we had numbers tattooed on our arm, and we had our head shaved. And finally we went to the shower, with screams and crying, hold onto one another.

Besides crying and hugging one another, and still not realizing the hell we were on, and then we fell asleep. And the net -- and the next day we were called to line up, and we lined up, and our group went to work into a ammunition factory, where the air was impossible to breathe because of the chemicals. We were cleaning and the fume was bad. We worked there for 12 hours, then we marched back to our barrack where we got soup which was like water, and a slice of bread which didn't even taste like bread. And again, we were counted, and at that time, before we were allowed to go to the barracks, we learned where our loved ones went and then we saw the crematorium, and the smoke out of that.</p></p></dialogue>

It's a word which I can describe -- I can't find word. The only person who was able to describe Auschwitz is Primo Levi. I don't know if you ever read any of his books. He was an engineer from Italy.

Because there were five women working in the ammunition factory who stood -- we had little bombs with holes, and we had to clean those hole, because the next department were putting in small, small balls in the holes, so it explodes when they needed it. So they sabotaged and they stole those. And you know where they hid it? They hid it in their mouth.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh my goodness.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And then one crematorium did explode. And it was only for overnight, but at least there were a few people less to be gassed at that particular time. But all those five women were caught, and they were hanged. And the whole camp had to stay for 24 hours, til those five women died hanging.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you had to stand and see this.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Everybody had to stand and watch those people die. It's interesting that not too long ago, on channel 26, they were showing --</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- and one woman who has survived was telling the same thing I was telling you, what has happened to those five women. So this was recorded and people talk about it. I was sitting in front the TV and I couldn't believe that other people are hearing the things we went through, because don't forget, I was still very young. And in between I already had the medical experimentation.

And I was taken, tied to a bed, things were taken from me, which I still don't know what parts were taken.</p><p>Another thing, which I didn't mention before, a month after we were in Auschwitz, none of the women had their periods any more, because, can you imagine thousands of women being there and having their periods monthly? None of us had their periods any more. But of course, having had the medical experimentation, it was such a tremendous impact on each and every one. There's one book here on the fifth floor, which 20 women who have survived medical experimentation in Ravensbriick have written a book.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Of course not. They did that to thousands of women. And another thing I have learned, that the cher -- Germans made experimentation in Auschwitz on babies. I didn't know that. You see, here at the museum, a little over a year ago, they had the seminar. Physicians or people who study medication from different countries in  <span class="page-break" number="92"></span> Interview with Fanny Aizenberg *deg April 21, 2011</p><p> Europe. There were 12 people, and I think they stayed here about 10 days. The interesting thing is, I couldn't understand til afterwards why I was chosen as a speaker to those people. Only because all those people have studied German medicine for the past 200 years, and what they were doing on us, they started to do that 200 years ago. Sterilization, abortion. What you call when men are being sterilized, there's a man in my --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: A vasectomy. A vasectomy.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, there's another word. It's gonna come afterward. There's three things that the Germans did. Hundreds of years ago, if a family in Germany had a child and they felt that that child is not perfect, they used to have an institution where they gave their child away. When that child, or adult for that matter, died, the family just got a notice, your so and so passed away, and that was it. Nobody has ever questioned it, because everybody had to be perfect in Germany, and if the -- they were not, they were taken to those institutions. And that's why, when they had the seminar here, they came to the museum, because of the background they have already learned, what the Germans did, hundreds -- sterilization. Couldn't think of it.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="93"></span> Interview with Fanny Aizenberg " April 21, 2011</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And they have books about that, and I took a book out because I wanted to show, when they had the seminar. But they were ahead of me, because they are the ones who taught me what has happened 200 years ago. So this now is just -- like they have one book which is called "The Nazi Doctors." People want to know, why was it possible, for educated people? It's not like today a bunch of hoodlums want your money and they kill you just for the money. This was organized by excellent physicians, nurses, educated people. How could they have done the horrors they did? I tell you another thing what happened Auschwitz and what the Germans did.</p><p>They had part of the camp where they had Gypsies collected from Europe. What they have decided and what they have done, there were women, were children and men. They decide that the men should lined up for the following day and that they're gonna be taken to work. Meanwhile, they have given milk to the children of the women who they took the fathers away. A few days later they took the women and the children. That was in August of 1944. And they gassed the women the following two days. In order not to fa -- have a -- a disturbing, they gave the babies the milk.</p><p>Can you imagine how vicious that is, and being done by educated doctors who were supposed to help people?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I can't even describe it, even now. My whole body is against and hurting. How do you describe things like that for people who have never seen horrors? We have never seen anybody being killed except through that period of time, and except seeing those babies being shot coming off the train. How could any normal, if there's a way of calling us normal, to live that the rest of your life? You can't.</p><p>That's why we have -- I have nightmares.</p></p></dialogue>

There's only two people, two young men from Czechoslovakia who escaped Auschwitz.</p><p>They describe Auschwitz, how the selections was, and they passed -- the main reason for the young men to escape and how they escape, and those were the two only ones who ever escape alive, is because they wanted to go to Czechoslovakia, where they come from, to go to different organizations, because Eichmann was getting everything from the Jewish community in Hungary. Trucks, tools, just name it, because he was fooling the Jewish people, telling them whatever you give us, then we would not have the discrimination or the deportation of the Jewish [indecipherable]. But it didn't happen so, because in spite of everything he took, it was continuing. It's -- it's really an amazing book if you could sit through and just read it. You have to have a lot of strength, or whatever you have in you. Because I was asked by one of the physicians who were here at the seminar, asking me how far I was in reading the book. And I said so far I'm on the second page, and I wasn't able to turn for the third. But I have learned from them, which they have studied and they would, you know, like see how this is continuing with the German people. And I wouldn't be surprised if that's still continuing today, of the experimentation they had. They were number one a few hundred years ago, did you ever hear in history when you went to school? Okay.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="96"></span>  100 Interview with Fanny Aizenberg April 21, 2011</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Fanny, I know it's -- I know that this is probably one of the most painful sections, but I would like, if you can, to describe what you can about the room, about whether you were alone in it, whether there were other women next to you --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: When they made the experimentation? No, there was one at the time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: One person?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: One person at the time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And were there nurses with you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, there were two women.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, German nurses were with you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Correct.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And a German doctor?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Correct.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Was it Mengele, was it another doctor, or you --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, Mengele only supplied --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- the people. Mengele had s -- his eyes were like evil. There's only one picture, I think the only picture they have at the museum of Mengele. There was no picture, he didn't want to have pictures taken.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And so was it a small room?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="97"></span>  101 Interview with Fanny Aizenberg April 21, 2011</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Very small. I don't know if you remember, a few years ago, Elie Wiesel and Oprah went to Auschwitz.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Did you say -- see that documentary?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: [heard of it, yeah I heard of it, that was a --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, there's a documentary, and they show you the snow and they show the shoes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They also show -- and I didn't know that til I saw that documentary, that they have made experimentation on men. And I didn't know that til I saw that documentary. It -- it's -- it -- and also you see shelves with little jars of whatever they took from people, or whatever they put into people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you know how long you were in that place?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You don't, because you think it's gonna be the end your life. You think this is it.</p><p>I thought that this is it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: This is it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And I understand what the other women describing in the book. Was the same.</p><p>We didn't know what was done.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you -- did you have a moment that say, you pass out and then at some point you come to consciousness again?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="98"></span> </p><p> 102 Interview with Fanny Aizenberg April 21, 2011</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You never lose consciousness, because you're too scared. You think at -- that's -- I thought, I don't know others, that this is gonna be my last moment and I have to hang onto it to see my last moment going out of me. You see, this is why it's so difficult for me to stand up and to speak, because everybody had different experiences. But here at the museum, of having so many survivor volunteers, I'm the only one who had the medical experimentation. And this is why maybe it took me so many years to be talking about. And like I told you, took me 50 years after I came back from Auschwitz from -- liberated from the Russians. I was in the hospital a few times in Belgium. Don't forget we didn't have our period a month after we got to Auschwitz, and with the experimentation it took me 50 years to be able to talk about that period. But you know while they did those experimentation, it was like little by little your life gets less, and you think you there already. Then you feel another pain, and it's not there yet, you still have to go lower.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So you feel you're still alive because you still can feel pain. Not that you can feel anything else, but the pain tells you --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, another thing which was difficult for me to talk about, especially here, where you have single people, who fortunately were able to start a life again and have a family. And I couldn't have children any more.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="99"></span> </p><p> 103 Interview with Fanny Aizenberg April 21, 2011</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did you have -- after you were released, after you were again free -- I'm jumping ahead, but I'Il come back to the other topics, did you have any kind of medical help after the war?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yes, I was in the hospital a few times in Belgium, and when we came to America in "49, I were twice in the hospital.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And were the doctors then able to find out what had happened?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They only knew what was happened, and they only find out when we came to America in "49, why I could not conceive. So you -- so you see, it -- it's not like a redeeming way of life. Like people were fortunate to start the life again, married and having families. That's why I don't think it was proper for me to talk here. Cause I don't know if people could put the two and two together. You can't. I can't. So how could somebody else just make peace with oneself? You can't. You just can't.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And yet, you had a child, you were reu -- reu -- reunited with, and you raised her and she raised a child, or more than one. And as Steve said, now it's down to the fourth generation, and -- and despite that, despite -- despite it, you were able to raise her.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: To make a human being out of her?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Definitely. You're absolutely right. You're absolutely -- not only because she's a human being, but she's a wonderful human being. And another thing which has been  <span class="page-break" number="100"></span> </p><p> 104 Interview with Fanny Aizenberg April 21, 2011 found out, more and more studies are being done on us, that children of survivors either went into education, or went into medicine. And I tell you why "m mentioning that to you. I think it's very important, because now here in America, you hear so much violence, you hear so many young people killing one another.</p><p>Either students, or just in the street the gangs. So when they arrest a young person, 14 - 15, who has been killing, the judge or whoever defends those people, feel because they didn't have a very good upbringing, that's what made them violent.</p><p>What about babies born and never know the parents, like you see the program a couple weeks ago, we were still looking for the pictures of children who have never been able to connect to any family, because they were in hiding, or the parents didn't come back, or any family come back to claim them. But all those children who have been in hiding, they definitely didn't have a good upbringing. And then in spite of that they all in education, or in medicine. Like my daughter, who is in education, and my granddaughter is a medical si-- psychiatrist.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: An amazing achievement.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But most children of survivors, even born after the war, went into education.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Fanny, it's hard to ask, you know, that sort of simple question of what happened then, what happened then? I mean, you -- here we are, you're in this room, you're being tortured, you're being dehumanized through this medical experimentation, and you feel like it's your last moment, but it's not.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="101"></span>  105 Interview with Fanny Aizenberg April 21, 2011</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you -- did at some point they finish and then send you back to the barracks?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>Did they let you heal?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yes, and then there was another session. There never was one session.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It was more than one session?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: More than one time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes. And the only thing they had in thy -- that room is like shelves with jars of different parts, and you see that if you even watch Oprah and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Were those jars there when you were ha -- when they were performing experiments on you too?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, uh-huh, because there was already things from people before me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you have any recollection of the doctor?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think if I would see him today I would recognize.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did they talk to you at all?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did they shout at you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. They shout at us not to move.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: They shouted at you not to move. Were there people holding you down?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="102"></span> </p><p> 106 Interview with Fanny Aizenberg April 21, 2011</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They didn't have to, because we were tied down. You couldn't move, even if you would -- wanted to.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: When you went back -- when -- di -- were you brought back to the barracks, or did you have to walk back? Could you have --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: We had to walk back to the barracks.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And did the other -- other inmates in those barracks have an idea of what had been going on?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Some did, some did not.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you have any idea of how long this went on?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't know, because we had no concept of time. It seems like endless, like I think I tried to explain to you, til it's going to be the end. That's why you hold onto it, because you want to see your own end.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Was there a time when they eventually stopped, or was this -- once you were chosen, until liberation came, you were part of this --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: That was quite awhile.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was it the same people all the time who were doing this, or different people?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, the nurses were different, and I think the doctors were different.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was this your lowest moment?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think so. I think so. One redeeming thing we did have, is in 1944, which was very bad in Auschwitz, more beatings for no reason. We think it was for no reason,  <span class="page-break" number="103"></span>  107 Interview with Fanny Aizenberg April 21, 2011 and we were still working in the factories and we had to lined up, which was the common thing to do. And we had Eichmann and Hess warning us that if we not making more than our quota, we gonna go to the gas chambers, which were right there. And we were already working more than any human resistance could do, because of the fume and everything. You see, our eyes have changed already because of this -- the odor, and the fumes, which was really bad, because we had to wash them in some kind of a product.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Fanny, were you given any time to recover, or after you were brought to the barracks --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: There's not such thing as recovery.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you had to go to work after?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Mm-hm, like nothing has happened.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: God. I usually don't run out of -- I don't run out of words, but I've run out of words, because it just -- there are no words. There are no words.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I couldn't find words, and I want to say a lot more, and I don't have the words.</p><p>That's why I think I told you before I started, I thought I know English, but apparently I don't. There's so many things which are just impossible to find words.</p><p>There isn't any words.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="104"></span> </p><p> 108 Interview with Fanny Aizenberg April 21, 2011</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: There isn't any words for such a cruelty or unhuman cruelty. There isn't any words. That's why I didn't go into the writing class. Because there is no words.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: What goes --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And anyway, Auschwitz is not describable. There was one famous person that he tried to describe Auschwitz, and he said, there's not enough paper, and not enough ink in the world. But I don't know if I told you before, Primo Levi was a scientist.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>After the war when he was liberated, he went back to Italy where he was from. He got his position back, which was very high position. He got married, he had a son, and he committed suicide, because he could not accept the outside world. According to many statistic, there's about 42 people who have survived Auschwitz and killed themself. I mean prominent people. When I say prominent, is people who got positions back after the war. They were recognized as people and they could not accept the outside world, after having seen what has been done to people. And I don't think that any of us, if it wouldn't be for the seminar, happened here in the Holocaust museum, I did not know that the Germans did medical experimentation on babies. But they knew that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Fanny, did -- did that thought ever cross your mind, tha --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh, many times, many times.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: After the war?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="105"></span>  Interview with Fanny Aizenberg " April 21, 2011</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: After the war. Because I could not accept cruelty for no reason to ba -- to be done to another human being. Not what I have seen in my -- in Auschwitz. Not what my eyes have seen. I'm even surprised that I'm as normal as I am today. Or just functioning to a certain extent, which is not really functioning, because the pain and agony doesn't go out, never.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: When you were returned to Josy and returned to your husband -- [break]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- did you feel alone with them?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, because I -- I -- you could not have the talk, like I have with you today. And --and don't forget, this is many years ago. I could not express what I'm expressing today. That's why I said to you, took me 50 years after Auschwitz to be able to -- and I think I'm very lucky, thanks to Steven, who knew, little by little -- don't forget, has been nine years that we were sitting weekly together.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you, at some point, tell Josy?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Never. Never. I really wonder today -- my daughter went to the different classes in order to be able to give the guided tours. And she shows everything, of emotion.</p><p>And I always wonder, does she tell anybody, this is what my mother went through?</p><p>And they don't show you the experimentation, they only show you the beatings and the works, you know, done in Auschwitz. And I was wondering, and I never had enough guts to ask her if she tells the people, this is what my mother lived through.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="106"></span> Interview with Fanny Aizenberg m April 21, 2011</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do -- would you feel that if she did that, she would be in some ways --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: When she gives the talks, she doesn't want me to come.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Does she tell you why?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: She said she would be crying.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When you -- when you, after the war, had Josy back, did you feel like you were distant from her, or were you --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't think so.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't think so. I think I told you when you heard me talking, when I came back, I didn't have a place, and I stayed with my sister because she got her place back.</p><p>And we had two beds to sleep, but Josiane very often came to the bed where I slept, and she used to tie her nightgown with mine, to make sure I wouldn't go away.</p><p>Don't forget, she was only a little over five.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: She was a baby still, yeah. That's not really what I'm -- what I'm asking about is not what -- is not what she got. Because clearly, if she had not felt secure in you, she would have grown up differently.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh sure.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. But I'm asking more of what did you feel? If you've gone through such experiences, and you come back and you are --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="107"></span>  111 Interview with Fanny Aizenberg April 21, 2011</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I wanted to hold her all the time. That's all I wanted to do, just go to bed and hold her all the time, so she wouldn't go away.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: With a double nightgown.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: She'd do that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. When did your life change in Auschwitz?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: From the minute we got there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I meant aft -- we're going through the experiments, but at some point the war does start to turn against the Germans.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We have not witnessed that, because we were on the dead march.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Can you tell me about --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And the reason being called the dead march, because it was heavy snow and diseases were terrible. Hunger was unbelievable.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Before we get there Josy -- I mean, excuse me, Fanny, what I want to ask about is, do you remember if the work in the ammunitions factory ever became less and less, and was there a time -- when did you go on the death mar -- what changed within the camp that all of a sudden --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It didn't change, we all went out. Auschwitz was evacuated the 17" of January, and the 27 of January, the Russians came in. That's why they evacuated the whole camp.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- as if it were a normal day?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And then what happened?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And then we all had to lined up and march. We --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Out of Auschwitz. And --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And we marched -- well, our group, we marched from Auschwitz to Ravensbriick, and there's a friend of mine in the museum who made me a map.

And you can't imagine that you were able, after Auschwitz to ca --Id---Idon't know what was, and that's why so -- that's why it's called the dead march, because either people died of disease, people couldn't walk any more, or they were shot. Because in the snow, as you were walking you saw drops of blood, people who had been shot because they couldn't -- one was holding up another, til the other couldn't be held up any more, and dropped. So that's how you knew how many have died. And many have been liberated way before our group was liberated.</p><p>And we were really -- really found out accidentally, because this was already the last battle by the river Elba. And I didn't know the distance of anything, think I told you, somebody was nice enough who works at the museum, has made me a map. I want to know what happened to me through the different times. And he made me the map, the map -- many people have been liberated by the British, mostly by the Americans. I had the cousin who survived, was liberated by the Americans, and died two days later, because the food she was given, she couldn't take it any more. But we were -- we just gave up, the six of us. And you know when you see sometime those black bags where you put garbage in?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: This was two months later. The reason why we were discovered, it was the last battle near the Elba, between the Russians and the Germans. And of course, the Russians won at that time. They were looking for Germans or Nazis who were hiding, and many did, because we have witnessed the Russians killing them.</p><p>Because looking for Germans, they found us. And they took us in a makeshift hospital and they cleaned us up, because we all had the typhus.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You were six women, or two -- or how many were left?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The six of us.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The same six who were in the barracks?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. We had frozen toes, we had no fingernails, and you see our eyes, it was only a li--a white, because of the fume of the time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: From the -- yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And we all had the typhus. Not clean at all, we really were in a very bad shape.</p><p>And they were very kind. They gave us -- first they clean us up. They give us what they had, it was only milk. And because they didn't have food, that saved our lives, because people who have survived, either with the Americans or the British, got the rich, canned food. Like I said, I had the cousin who survived and got those canned foods. And she survived with her brother, and she couldn't take the food, and she  <span class="page-break" number="111"></span> Interview with Fanny Aizenberg " April 21, 2011</p><p> just died. And we were lucky because that's the only thing they had, they probably s-stole some cows and that's how they have milk to help us. And we stayed there for about 10 days. The Red Cross found us. We got recommendations from the Russian doctor to tell us what we should do when we go back to make sure we go to the doctor, which we did. And on the way back from the people from the Red Cross, I went with a friend of mine from the six who didn't have anybody to go. The four others had family and friends which they went, but they didn't -- although they were my age, maybe a couple years older, they didn't live long.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Why not?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So, we don't know the reactions. And then once I came back to Belgium, I really had a lot of medical problems.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can you tell us a little bit about what they were?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I-- don't forget, we didn't have our period the day we -- toom -- two months after being in Auschwitz, and I think with experimentation, we don't know what was put in the body, we don't know what was taken out from the body. We know blood was taken out because that was supposed to be sent to the soldiers in Russia who were on the front. [technical interruption]</p></p></dialogue>

Okay. Another thing I wanted to go back to, like I had said, Primo Levi found his solution cause he couldn't connect to that other world.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: He committed -- and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: He could not accept the other world.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: World.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He could not -- and he wrote many books -- he could not exp -- tolerate with himself that somebody else is able to do an organizing Auschwitz. He couldn't accept that, that another human being could do that. And that's why he commit -- he committed suicide.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And was -- and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And not only because he committed suicide, but don't forget, he was one of the very few who has been accepted in society of -- for what he was before.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He was accepted in society, he was accepted in his job. He got married, never been married before. Got a son. And just could not accept the rest of the world. He was on the step and he like, hanged himself. And there's 42 other people, with names and everything, they -- they just could not accept the humiliation they lived through and the effect this had on their lives, and society outside. Look how many  <span class="page-break" number="113"></span> </p><p> 117 Interview with Fanny Aizenberg April 21, 2011 people would not be able to sit down and have a conversation for me to tell their life.</p><p>You know that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Of course, of course. It's very hard, it's very hard for anybody to talk about a time when they're humiliated, to talk about what is that humiliation, to describe it to anybody, for different reasons. To a stranger because they're a stranger. To a loved one because, as you said before, you want to protect them. To yourself. It is very hard to do that and it takes -- it takes a great deal of courage.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't know, I don't know. I really don't know. And it took me a long time, as you know. And even my daughter told me yesterday, Mother, if you in such agony, why do you accept doing that? And she knows, or I hope she does, the toll it takes from me. It's not like you clean yourself, it's not, you never are clean.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But you never were dirty. You never were. It was not you who was dirty. It was those who did those things.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But I have yet to hear anybody saying that they sorry what has happened. My son-in-law Freddie, spoke to a group of people here from different countries of Europe, who have graduated and they got like a trip from Germany, from France, those were all graduated students who got like a scholarship, and they were already in higher studies. A very small group. There was one young woman from Germany, the only one from Germany, came to Freddie and says, I beg you forgiveness, and crying.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So no one ever said to you, I'm so sorry for what you went through?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Not yet. Si--I'm still waiting. I don't think --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: How do you -- how do you -- how do you live a life --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You don't.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- without being bitter?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It's not bitter, it's painful. It's very painful. I think -- like I have been asked once for students if I hate those people. And the on -- only answer I could give, because if I would be a hateful person, I would hurt myself. That's what I answer the Catholic youngsters.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. Well, it is a religious answer.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because if I would be a hateful person -- the only person who said he would never forgive them and hates them was Wiesenthal when he wrote his book. He said he would never forgive them. Now, I'm not a hateful person, and like I said to the youngsters, if 1 would be a hateful person, I would hurt myself, because I could not live with hate.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But it is pain. But you live with pain.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah, yeah. Well, this --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I can't, I wish I could. I wish I could, because my days wouldn't be as painful.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>And it's hard to convey that to another person who has not a patient of wanting to understand a survivor, because I -- I don't think there's too many people who understand, really, a survivor. I remember quite a number years ago, they had five psychiatrists sitting on the stage here in the Rubinstein room, all psychiatrists, medical psychiatrists and of course they were talking, the majority, survivors. They knew how we feel. They knew without interviewing anybody like you and I are talking now.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It's a wonderful relationship, it really is, because it's so unexpected and it's so wonderful that we have been able to get -- cause don't forget, not because our background is different. I think I have learned to get along with many people, I hope so, because if -- if I haven't learned it now, I never will. And I appreciate relationships, I appreciate people. And I think that's really what makes me tick.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It sounds like it. You know, I -- I'm just -- I'm sad to hear that you think of yourself as less than, because of what you went through, rather than more than.</p></p></dialogue>

We've -- you know, we're -- you were in -- you were on the death march, you're liberated, you're brought back to Belgium. How did you meet Jack again? How did -- how did that happen? What happened to your younger sister? Did you --</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see. So all three sisters survived?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. But you know what's interesting, my older sister -- I was the middle one, and my younger sister -- my younger sister was at least eight years younger than I am. Six or seven at least. Both of them died of cancer. My older sister died of cancer, my young sister Rose died of cancer. Both of them have never been in a camp. They were sheltered. Both were in that shelter all the time. My younger sister was in that convent with that habit and it -- did what all the good nuns do.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: [indecipherable]</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I'm the only one. I look different. A different personality completely, always was. The two of them were very pretty and tall. My older sister was tall and slim and dark hair. And I must be like the misfit in the whole business. And my younger sister was nice and tall and extremely educated and extremely smart. And she died of cancer, the same cancer my older sister had.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't know. I think it must be a combination. My husband is dead for 22 ow -- two years. I have had many proposals, but I guess I wanted something else from companionship, and probably the other person, like me, wanted me for what I have.</p><p>But it's not what I was hoping to get, and I didn't -- I just wouldn't settle for second best. But you know, it all depends what you want.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, it does, it does.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Or what you're willing to sacrifice or to offer. I was not ready to be a wife.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Again.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Correct. I just -- and the two of them were very educated, very intelligent, but it -- it just was not -- like I told you, I was not ready to be a wife. So now you know me from inside out.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, "ve gotten -- I've had the honor to get to know a little bit about you, and I appreciate --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think you know a lot, because I have never uncovered myself to the extent I did with you. And I think you have a wonderful quality of bringing that out from people.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, this is -- it is -- you see, the purpose is not to -- the purpose is not to expose somebody in a way that is invading their privacy. The purpose is to share what was the reality, and what it does.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The emotions in life.</p></p></dialogue>

And they were not all religious people. The majority started from churches and convents, because we needed that -- I mean, they needed that outlet. But can you imagine in society today that people would want to risk their life to save somebody else's child, at such a high cost?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Not only for themselves, but the whole convent for that matter, which they were responsible. And there's so many horror books about young people, what they went through in hiding in convents. But then again you hear wonderful stories.

And I will tell it by way of a little story.</p><p>Thirty years ago I remember, I was a member of Amnesty International, okay. And Amnesty International was having campaigns against torture. And there were some people that came to their attention. And at that time there was the aftermath of the Cambodian genocide. And there was a young man they featured in one of their stories, and what he said always struck me, because he was somebody who survived the Cambodian genocide. He saw his parents murdered, he saw his -- his siblings murdered, and he survived. And he said, I survived not only because I ca--I am living and breathing, I survived because I can love again, after having gone through that. And that is an achievement, because so many people couldn't, after they have  <span class="page-break" number="126"></span> Interview with Fanny Aizenberg " April 21, 2011</p><p> been exposed to this kind of brutality, this kind of hatred, they couldn't. And everything I hear from you about your children, about Josy, about your grandchildren, about the people that you ever -- it has that spirit of love to it. And that's why I can't -- I can't imagine that you would be anything other than more than, rather than what you said earlier about feeling inferior.
