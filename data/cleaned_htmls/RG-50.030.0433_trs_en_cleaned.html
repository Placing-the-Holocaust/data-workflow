So in 1941, we decided to leave the occupied zone of France and we crossed the demarcation line, we paid somebody to take us over, we crossed the river, river. <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was, what was, for you as a child at the time, all of this moving around, what was that like for you? I mean, how did that...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The life was, was, I was in the back of my mind that maybe I was not going to stay there a very long time, then we move again. Of course when we were in free zone, it was better off because actually we were French and the Vichy(ph) government was arresting the foreigners to, to, they give them to the Germans, which I learned after the war. And in Lucien(ph), I had some teachers who tried to teach mostly socialist people, socialist member or, but there were also anti-Semitism, you know, whatever the kids heard at home, bringing back to school and saying stories about Jews and so forth. For awhile we live in a hotel and after that we rented a place. I had my Bar Mitzvah there and I was introduced to Jewish history by a woman named Mila(ph) Raseen(ph) who became a very well known Jewish resistance member. She died under torture in and , passing children to Switzerland she was caught. Mila(ph) Raseen(ph). And...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember feeling a lot of fear and anger or, how would you describe and what did you talk about with your family, about what was happening?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, during that year, until the German came in the free zone, I wouldn't say we felt completely safe, but the Germans were not there, so we, we thought, we could survive the war there. But the Vichy(ph) government was anti-Semitic because you know they, they put, in effect, regulation that the German did ask them for. We try, for awhile we wanted to go to Spain. Since we were we heard that the Spanish, the Jews from Spanish origin, if they cross over to Spain they would not be taken back to the French, but we didn't pursue that because there were too many children, we had to go over the mountains, so we didn't.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How many were you altogether in your family at this time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, that time there when we left, when we left there, when the German <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So eight children and then your mother and your two uncles and their wives?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My mother, my two uncles and my and my aunt, yeah and my grandfather. My grandfather, yeah. Later on I'll give you, I'll give you an event that took place when the Gestapo arrested us and there was a deal. Part of the deal was that either myself or my grandfather would have to go with them. Where to be, go, go back with the Germans, to be shipped to Dollsee(ph). But that was the choice that was given and from what I'm told, they thought that since I was younger than my grandfather, I had a better chance to survive and I've been a little upset by this during my life because I think it was unjust. But that's history, you can't tell. I came back alive, but he would not have come back alive. But I came back alive, deeply marked. If I would not have been deported, I would have been a different man. I think I've marked, I have been marked much more because I went there very young. Some adults, maybe had their character formed already and it was not as, as strong effect on them as it was on me. Then when the German came, in November 1942, week later, the whole zone along the Spanish border was declared a <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> event that never left me, it must have been the summer 1942 when we went out of sports, playing soccer and when we finished and it was outside town a little bit, was a, a , a few guys, a few children that wanted to see how I was circumcised, had heard that in church or whatever it is.</p><p>And and they wanted to see, how does it look to have your male part circumcised and they took me by the arm, on the ground and so forth, took off my pants. And this I will never forget and never forgive them. It was part of the anti-Semite atmosphere. I wouldn't say that everybody was antagonistic toward the Jews, but many were and there was also the religious influence and the religious schools, Catholic schools and so forth, it was really a hotbed of anti-Semitism. On the other hand you have the, the secular school and the teachers, which other time, mostly came from the Socialism, Socialist background. I wish they were more sympathetic to the Jews, but not as bad as people reared in the religion, religious, in the Catholic religion and so forth. A lot of people say that the French, you had the big round up in Paris on the 16th of July, where there was a change of mind for. Well, maybe, but as far as I'm concerned, that, the change of sentiment didn't come from the, from the, that : It really switched around six months later, first when the German lost the battle of and went into retreat in Africa and then, couple months later, Stalingrad, that was the turn and in many people's mind, there was this possibility that Germany will lose the war. So that's what I feel.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So tell me you're, you're in the Italian zone.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: At this point, in ?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: First we arrive in Nice, we stayed about a month in Nice and then we went to__._I went back to school, in the school there. In the atmosphere was different because the people over there hated the Italians very much, you know, despised the Italians. Actually, I'd become friendly with the Italian soldiers, I remember they used to have a picnic on the, on the grass in a little meadow when I was coming back from school and time they called me up and they were listening to the radio, English radio, BBC and they would give it to me and talk to me and friendly attitude.</p><p>And we knew that the French to arrest anybody and... But the atmosphere was <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> different that the people of Savoire(ph) were more, I would call today rightist or, and they hated the Italians. So much that I'm sure that when the German came, they were glad that the German took over from the Italian.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was, before we get to this, to the part when the Gestapo came...</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, not restriction, no, no, not at that time. Of course in that zone we didn't have to wear the stars. We didn't have to wear the stars but our name was following us of course. And, and you know, we were coming in the middle of the school year and you know, all that was noticed and so forth. I don't have any good memories there from my teachers or school. No, no I don't recall any people that left a print on my remembrance of this time in . Now, later on we knew that we were turned in by the, by the French people, Frenchmen.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So tell me what happened after.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, after , that's where I was picked up and sent to Drancy and eventually to Auschwitz.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So tell me about what happened.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well it was one of my uncle, my uncles had decided that it was time to move out of Savoire(ph), because in Savoire(ph) you had a lot of, the resistance was starting, there were attacks on Germans and the militia, the French militia. There was important resistance activity, it was starting. And a lot of German troops, also, a lot of German troops and police and so forth. And one of them went to and , the center of France and he found a place where, it seemed <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> turn us in. And then when the Gestapo came, he was with them. And it was the 23rd of December, 1943, just a couple of days before _, Christmas, a holiday, a very important holiday for the Germans, you know. I imagine maybe they were lenient because it was . They didn't want to take the children and have that party, you know, I guess they had the French girls in the, in the hotel with them, I mean that's where, they were stationed in the hotel. Anyway, they took only four of us.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So who did they take?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They take myself, my mother, my aunt and my two uncles. And...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I'm sorry, I'm confused, when you told, you said before that there was a deal that was made about your grandfather, that was a different time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. No, no, that was at that time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Isee. So it could have been your grandfather, but they decided you, I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, yeah. The Germans probably told them, well we have to bring five people, so you four and four others and either one of these two, you choose.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Who made the decision?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well actually it was, I think it was a decision between a member of the family, or... I'm told there wasn't, there was some discussion and so forth. The real truth is only, is only known to God.</p><p>But after the war I remember that my mother was upset about it. But that's it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you know, did you have any idea where you were going?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. I'll tell you why, it's because in the fall of 1943, , September, October. We were listening to the BBC every day. I remember clearly, as if it was yesterday, report <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 0 the BBC, so everybody was knowing it, was, was aware what was going on," and so forth. And the adults, _, okay, yeah we heard it too, but we didn't believe it. If we would have believed it, we would have acted in revolt, they didn't believe. But I believed. I believed it. So...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When you left to go to Drancy with, with the Gestapo, who stayed behind with the children?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: One aunt, she was ___, they didn't take her because she was pregnant and she stayed with the children. And then the German Gestapo man says, "You stay here, we come back to pick you up." But of course as soon as they left, she left and my brother, sister and my, my grandfather was taken by one of the employee that we had in Paris before, that came from Paris, and pick her up, pick them up and took them back to their, to her home and hide them over there. And the others, they went to .

I didn't see one German, only French gendarmes were around.</p><p>And were already at us. Very sentimental, was a sentimental place for me because my grandfather, my grandmother on my father's side lived there and they lived only a few blocks from the camp and so I knew Drancy. And I stayed three weeks there and then on the 20th January, 1944, five, six o'clock in the morning, everybody in the courtyard and a bus arriving and there was a German yelling, which I found out later on, no I was told because everybody was talking about Bruner(ph), Bruner(ph) the commandant.

Actually when I left camp, liberation, I understood the, not all German, but | would say I, I could manage. But still, I mean, I didn't speak German. If you spoke Yiddish or German, there was not a better chance to survive, but . Then after that we were assigned to different commandos, for different barracks and I wasn't lucky, I was put in the commando, cable lane commando, the toughest one because it was outside, we were working outside, pulling cables and trenches and people were dropping like flies and it was cold.</p></p></dialogue>

The whole camp, that was a miserable time, outside, waiting and waiting in the cold, before going to work and then there were the selections. Now the selection, that was the worst. The worst event in camp life, when the, everybody was consigned into the barracks in the evening and everybody had to go in front of an SS, naked and then he decided if we were too weaks and so forth. That was the end, you didn't go to work the next day, but you would go in a truck and the truck would take you to Birkenau, to Auschwitz. That was, I saw some act of heroism, also some people going instead of another, to pass in front of the SS and giving a phony number, they risk their lives to save other people.</p></p></dialogue>

I saw it many times, . That was the way to death.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, because you didn't eat.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You didn't eat and you smoke and down you went, you would be picked up by the selection, selection and, and in order to survive, you have to eat, if you don't eat. Then, yes?</p></p></dialogue>

So as we walked, we saw a sign on the road, you know, road signs, Iselau(ph), Blivitz(ph), Auschwitz and then, at a time when we took a corner and it was not, it was the road to Blivitz(ph) instead of Auschwitz and we felt a little relieved but then we entered the, the Polish country, I mean flat. Very few trees to stop the wind and the wind was blowing and then we heard the Russian planes over and some bombing by the Russian planes and I said, well maybe they, they going to catch up with us, but, they didn't.
