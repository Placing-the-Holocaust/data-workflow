<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. Nobody saw us, because we ---- my mother ---- and you'll see the picture -- -- my brother, we all ---- we didn't look like the typical Jews, because typical Jews, they could recognize you. But we looked different because we were raised in a Polish town at that time, Aleksandrow Kujawski. We lived in, as all Polacks did. So, that's why we didn't look like the typical Jews. So, we decided, told him we were going to meet him at this and this place, and he was waiting for us there.</p></p></dialogue>

We slept over on a floor, on the floor, but we had ---- you know, like, put down like straw, in plenty time, if he found out that somebody was going to come to check the small town, the soldiers were going to come, the Germans, or pass by, so he kept us in the barn, you know. He has chickens and had a few goats, you know, from milk he used to got. And there were chickens. He had about 50 chickens maybe. And then he had one cow. And he had two horses. So, we kept us there. Plenty of times we had to go in there to stay, but in the summertime, I didn't mind staying there. You know why? Because it was better than in the house, you know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I understand there were woods outside. How much time were you ----</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: In the woods.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: ---- out doors?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was a very good location, the woods, because his whole backyard was woods and swamps, so, in the summertime, we used to go to the woods and stay there. We used to enjoy ourselves because it was fresh air. You didn't have to sit in one place, you know, because she used to look out through the window to see if anybody's coming, God forbid, so we used to sneak out and stay in the wood. And then, if it was rainy or bad weather, we used to come back. So, he used to tell us when it's safe to come back.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was the signal to know whether it was safe or not?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Used to put on a few bricks there, you know, stone. If you put down, let's say, like three, four bricks, one on top of the other, that means it was safe. And ---- but most of the time it was safe. I'll tell you why, because it was the last house, and not too many soldiers, Germans, came that time, because they were busy with the Russian front. So, they, maybe, since I was there, hiding, for the two years, maybe once or twice, I'd say, I heard them talking that they came to check the town, but they never came there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And did the neighbors ever stop by unexpectedly?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, because people ---- I told you, in our location ---- first of all, they didn't bother with anybody. They were old people. They didn't have no children, which was the favor for us, because otherwise they were afraid for their children or their grandchildren, and they got rid of the dog. Why? Because the dogs used to bark, you know. So, he got rid of the dog, and he kept us there. He always begged us, even in they capture ---- they'll capture you or they'll find out about you, don't tell them that I saved you. Don't tell them that I kept you here.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And during the time you were in hiding, did he bring you any news? Did you have any idea what was going on?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, always news. Because he was more interested about the news than I did, because he wanted to get rid of us as soon as possible. He told us that, you know, when ---- how he did, the Russians were coming close to this, that only says, Do me a favor, when the Russian comes, don't run out, in case the Russians come into that village. Wait "til I'll tell you. Because he used to go to town and sell something, you know, little woods. He used to make little bundles of wood and sell it in town.</p></p></dialogue>

He said he was sure ---- what you have the pictures there ---- they dig ditches and they throw them in and then burn them, the one which they couldn't take, the last minute, to Majdanek and Treblink</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They burned them. He said he know that some of them escaped. Where they are, he doesn't know. He knows that some of them stayed with the Polish girls, they say. And then, when he came to the last time to tell us that the Russian are all ready in Shedlitz. He told us that he saw a few guys there. But he says, Don't say to any of these people where you stood. Because he was afraid, he was so scared because the Polacks were terrible. So, when he came ---- when he told us that the Russians came, we went out there at night, also, that nobody should see that, you know, stood there. And we went to Shedlitz. He told us where the committee is with the survivors. So, we went straight there. And we were not ---- and the door, they were afraid to open up. They thought, who was there? They thought maybe the Polacks come to kill them. So, in Shedlitz, we didn't stay too long.</p></p></dialogue>
