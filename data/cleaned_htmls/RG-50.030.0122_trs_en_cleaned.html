<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Fine. Magna, where were your born?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was born in Budapest. Shall I say the date? 18th of July 1923.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Good. Could you tell us a little about your family at that time in the early years of your life.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Of my childhood?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well...uh...I can tell you very nice things. My childhood in my early, early years...uh...probably the best years in my life because there was no problem. My father was...uh... a director in...at...at a very nice textile company which...textile company which everybody knew in Budapest, Goldberg was the name. He was working there from younger age, and gradually working himself up so he had a very comfortable, nice, pleasant life. My mother never worked. She was a homemaker. And my father who was working everyday and I had...I had a little sister who I never knew. Her name was Clara. She...That was the firstborn to my mother. She died when she was a child...a baby, an infant, 8, 7...7 weeks old. And then after came mv little brother. John. who is Hungarian and thev <span class="page-break" number="0"></span> house there. To the building. It was an apartment. It was not a private home. And it's lovely street. It's a verv well known street in Budanest. It's called _ And nowadavs when <span class="page-break" number="0"></span> years. And I went from that...from the primary school, I went to the Jewish leitsiam, which is...the street still exists. I don't think that the school existed in Albiana Street. Maybe it is. I didn't look for that one. What I was looking for and surprisingly I didn't find when I went back to Hungary...I went for...after 4 years in that school, I went for a year or so...a year to a Catholic school. And then from...from the Jewish school...the Catholic school, and on the end I ended in the Commercial Academy of Budapest, which is a very beautiful and very important school. And I went there for 2 years. Actually, I have at home...in back in Arizona, my primary school report cards of 4 years and I found some of the report cards from the Jewish leitsiam, high school, so-called high school. I didn't find anything from the commercial academy. But as a...as a history, I learned that the Commercial Academy but as a...as a history I learned at the Commercial Academy to write typewriter and geography and mathematics and subjects, accounting and things which was connected to the..uh...Commercial Academy. And I didn't find the Academy at all, and I told my husband that I really have to go back and look for that. Why don't I? So I attended that. So the school years, if I can say that to you...the primary school and the high school were beautiful. The primary years, of course, were the best. I remember all the little gifts we have gotten. I was a very good student in primary school and my late brother, we were always being Jewish students in a...in a Protestant, because Dutch Reform was...mostly, they were Protestant. It's a reform school, and even we...the Jewish children, we had special religion class everyday in the morning, the Jewish students...the few of them. And we were allowed to go to their church where they sing all the beautiful psalms, you know, the Protestant Psalms. And we learned that. And that gave us a very good relationship with the other students.</p><p>Unfortunately, I have never ever met anybody when I went back to Budapest in 77, anybody at all from my school years. Probably was a Gentile Christian children went other ways. The Jewish probably were all most killed, because I didn't see anybody. So in our life, I speak about, you know, 23, and I got to school when I was 5 and a half, 20 years, 29, 30, 32, and all the way up to...I would say... remember the date on 1938, that my father was at the table sitting at lunch time. He came home every day for lunch, and he came every evening home and...and the good years he had even a car. And I know it was a Fiat. And we...we didn't travel on that much I know, but when we went to Lake Balaton for the summer season for the 4 weeks, we traveled on this car. So...but that doesn't mean that we were wealthy, just because he was in this position in this textile company which was the largest in Budapest, he could afford it I suppose or they gave it to him. I don't know whether it was his or the company, but we had the car. And...uh...I just don't know...that day I remember very clearly...1 remember that for years, that my father opened the newspaper at lunchtime. We were very quiet at lunch. We were not supposed to...not because he was strict. He was not as strict...my mother was stricter to us than my father. I never even been spanked or anything my father ever in my life. Never! I didn't put this in the paper, but I come to my mind, the only time I remember that my father was...became angry with me. One day when I was a child and he said. "You have to 20 with me todav and with -- to Grandma." his mother <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> fantastic son and unusual son too because he cared for my mother in last years of her life.</p><p>And my mother, if I said something fresh which we were not supposed to...1 remember once that I fought with my older brother. My...my younger brother wasn't alive. We fought or something. And I beat my brother, Yanshi with from anger. And my mother...my brother went to complain to my mother and my mother said, "What did you do?" And I said, "Well, he said something or he didn't want to do something. I beat him. And I said you shouldn't do that. You will be punished. And you will be punished now if you continue this." And I was so upset about the punishment, I told my mother, "If you punish me Mother, I commit suicide." A word from a young child. And my mother gave me, "Why did you say that?" And I got it on my mouth. And I cried terribly. And my mother said, "You have to go into the corner, with your back turn around. And I just hysterically cried. Pardon me. And I remember that because | cried. cried and then she came to me and embraced me <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> that...in that district and whichever district we lived, and so my brother had to go and left in 1943. I seen him once more because in the...in the labor camps...so-called labor camps, because and that's the exact translation. is lahor and tava is a camn. so it was a <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> to us...to the Jewish people that everybody should leave the house, and they had to be in an assigned building, and that's how we went from that particular place from to this street which was called Kine Street. It was not on the. near. but it was again the same <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> Jews were the last fortress in a way as we call it. And the rest we hear...we heard rumors. We heard the news, but we really didn't know exactly, because you really never knew exactly what happened. I didn't have a radio or my father had no radio at that time to hear any foreign news. Anyhow, my father...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Magda, before you go into that, could you come back.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, I can.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: To the house that you were moved into, the Star of David House.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yal. The Star of David house.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And...and tell us a little bit about what you did at that time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well,..uh...the Star of David House was the house that my father separated from us because when we went to the Star of David House and again, as you say, I don't remember exactly the date, but it must have been June or July when the Budapest Jews were already...you know, in Budapest, they had the Jewish Council who were discussing with Eichmann what to do with the Budapest Jews. That I remember historically that it happened. But my father went into hiding. And that particular time, his friends who were my friends and my late mother's friends...they offered him to stay with them and give him false documentation. So my father didn't live with us in that house because as far as I remember, I was the oldest, and my mother and my brother and my father said, "You would be taking care of my mother, your Mum and your brother. Whatever happens. I will be outside. Whatever I can help, I will help. If I can bring food, I will help food. If I can take you out, I will take you out, but at least I will be outside." This was a decision between my mother and father, and I know that he left and he went to live with these neonle whose name | know. of course. Steven - <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> time, it was a three-floor building and we were just coming in and we were assigned...uh...because the Consier in that building stayed on, was a woman, Christian woman. Very nice person, who was apparently appointed by either the Hungarian government or whoever that she...she should order where these people that coming to the building should live. So she assigned us, my mother and my brother to that floor, to the second floor in that apartment, which was a very large apartment, but I think we were at least 30-35 people in that apartment. So we were cramped together also in...in a place where nobody could bring their own furniture. But people they lived in there were their furniture, and we had only this basket with our winter clothing, what not, and some pillows. I remember that some pillows were stuffed in the basket. So...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was life like for you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Life was like that. You know the government allowed that one or two people in certain hours of the day went still with these David Star houses, which was not the ghetto, could go out into the street with the David Star. We were all marked of course with the yellow star. We all had. My father, not. My father was...sometimes we didn't even see my father 3, 4 days.</p><p>When he appeared suddenly during the hour when people...when we could move, he came into the building and he told...told us, "Don't go out on Tuesday or Wednesday because I will be coming when you are supposed to go out. So the building...the door was open. And also the Consiers...this woman whose name was Anna actually, she was quite nice to the people in the building. She was not a bad person. So my mother could come time to time to the building and bring us bread or bacon which was a no, no, but still whatever he could bring.</p><p>Some food. Hot food, I don't remember that he brought. But in that time, in the building is o98. was cas. and all the was a siegce citv hecause alreadv homb.. bombins. The <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> conflict...conflicting with the Shutzpass. My father came back. This was June and July, and we still could go out from the David House to shop if we had some money. We still could cook something on the stove, if we had one. We were in a horrible, frightening condition needless to say, because we heard that the Hungarian Nazis are coming to the buildings and getting off people from the buildings for a different marches to take them away wherever they wanted to take to deport them. Needless to say, Auschwitz. We didn't know that exactly where is Auschwitz. And my father was coming back time to time but not too frequent. And what happened, on one day I went out on the street because I was again the eldest...to the street where I can find some friends or contact because we needed food. We were very little food. We had no meat or no milk or nothing like that. You know, we had flour Nothing really or sometimes, some little bread. So we changed with people, or we had friends we could go to some friends and say, "Could you give me something because I'm in this house. I have to go back." So some friends helped sometime. One day I went out from the building and on the street I met a professor of mine from the Commercial Academy who was also a Jewish man and was much elderly than I am, probably I'm ____. He must have been that time 55. And we...as he recognized me, I recognized him and I said...he seen that I have a David Star and he had a David Star and I said, "Where do you live?" And a little conversation occurred, and he said, "You know there is a way out from this David Houses, David Star Houses, because he warned me and he said, "I am warning you that this house is endangered because they are setting up the ghetto in Budapest and on the ____.. In that area _____. Iremembered even the certain names of those streets. And he said, "You are endangered and we are endangered." I don't know where he was. I don't remember. He was not in the building. He says, "But there are some countries they're helping the Jewish people to get into protected houses. The Swedish and Swiss I knew about more or less, but I had no contact with these people and I didn't know where to go any how, so I just skipped that idea totally that I should go to these homes, the ligation. I just didn't... maybe I didn't even know where they were. But he said to me that you know the Spanish Ligation is also giving out passes and I...as of today, I don't remember where the Spanish Ligation was by the way. I have to ask Perlasca, Mr. Perlasca, where was it because I don't remember. But he said, "I'm going there. Would you come along?" And this was in an hour or two period when we were allowed to leave so we went together. And I said, "Yes, I want to have that because I might rescue my family." And he took me in and I remember the Ligation, there were a lot of people already there. I don't know how and I don't know when we got into...with him ...into the Ligation. It was in...not in _____ what is it called? Uh...I don't remember the name in English. It was a foreroom kind of. And as soon as we got there, Havier was attached to me or attached to us or attached -- Anvwav. ] met Havier. <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> 0 and...uh...by that time, my father was taken by the way. My father...and I...this was a period of end of October or beginning of November. I don't remember exactly the time, but it was in October because my father wasn't with us anymore. My father was taken from our building because he came back one night. One terrible night he came back to stay with us, brought food and the next morning...in the morning, the Hungarians came and round up the men and young women and we were round up...my father and myself together. We left together and my mother and brother in that building. And they took us in a long march and suddenly, the Hungarians separated the men from the women and I never seen my father on that day on. I only know that I marched with the Hungarian...with the women, Jewish women from the whole King street all the way in the alley was called Fosua and I went back by at my old school...my Julienne was there, and looked at it, and I went...passed by and they took us out, far away this march, picked up hundreds and hundreds of women. And they picked us up and took us in a big, I call it a lodge, but it wasn't a lodge. A big empty area outside of...kind of outskirts of Budapest. And there where I was. My father I never seen again. I know what happened more or less is my father, later I found this out, after the war, but my story...a long story what happened to me, but we go back. How we come...come to the Spanish...uh...Legation. So this professor of...1 came back from his horrible march. I rescued myself. How...L...it's a different story.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Why don't you tell us?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Okay, I'll tell you how. We went...this was very early morning. And this march began, sometimes at 4 o'clock, 5 o'clock in darkness and when...when these Hungarian Nazis came to the building and the...the...the way as they do it was a very regular way. They stand...the Hungarian...they had the autocrats. They didn't have swastika. They had black uniforms with this autocrats. They went...they were armed. They went in the middle of the house. The house...the European houses, as you know, had outside you could see downstairs to the...to the courtyard. This house was like that, so anybody who came out from the apartment was a...some could look downstairs, every apartment. So they...they stood in the middle of the court yard and were there...what is it called? with their microphone, not microphone.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q:</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yal. What they do like it and the police and they call it. They called out all men from a certain age, and all women for and that age should come down to the court yard. So everybody was frightened. Nobody could hide away. There was no way where to hide. So the age limit, what they directed, they came down. And there was my father. On that night he came, and my father had to go. And there was I in that age limit, so we went together. We said goodbye to my Mom and to my brother because we really didn't think that we would be never coming back or we never see each other. You know, people were naive. They didn't know this. So L..I get a little bag from my mother with some clothing, something in it. And my father, I don't recall that he had anything. My father had only a warm coat because I'm sure it was sometimes in October, because he had already a kind of a winter coat with a velvet collar on it, and a hat. And so we went together hand in hand, but on this march, out of <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> 1 the building...everybody out of it, hustled, hustled, hustled fast, were already a column on the street. We were not the only one. They picked up on all the... _ street had a fairly large Jewish population. That's true. So they took everybody from these homes which was set up to the street. And we marched and marched and we went by at the school and we didn't see and we didn't talk much because we didn't know what happened. And suddenly, they stopped the column and they separated the men and the women. So I said goodbye to my father, not even goodbye, it was kind of going away from me and I was in the middle of the other column and we were marching, marching, marching to this big area in Hungary. I think, if 1 remember well, it was in Zuglo, Z-U-G-L-O, which is kind of on outskirts...outside of the main city. And they marched, marched, marched. They hustled, you know, these...these aristocratic people. They shouted, "Well, Move," you know, very harshly.</p><p>Nobody...everybody...mostly young people I see...young person like Iam, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, I didn't see hardly in that column at all. And they took us to this (clearing throat) to this empty...empty grass lot, but it wasn't a lot really because there were hundreds. (clearing throat) There must be thousands. I don't know to me it looked incredible amount of people.</p><p>And all day, and it was from morning until late afternoon, we couldn't do anything. We couldn't...we didn't have food. We didn't have water. We didn't have toilets. If somebody had to go, we had to make it to secretly that they should finish up they had to finish because these guards were not that many, but they were around. They were walking. And I was...the lot was kind of...to me looked square, ____ square, I seen the people. And I was somehow on the edge of the square corner, kind of, and on this column. And I always pushed myself also to the side, because I had a feeling that I have to get away from here because if I don't get away from here I will not see my mother and brother. And interestingly enough, this edge where I was standing with others, hundreds, had a big ditch, a big ditch. It was the end of this lot, kind of. A regular ditch, which was like bush, bushes and green stuff, but dry stuff, and I didn't do anything on that whole day except freezing and thinking how will I get away and when. And I did that exactly on one moment when the guard was looking up. I just jumped.</p><p>Nobody wanted to do this, but I couldn't do anything else. I jumped and rolled into this ditch.</p><p>I just rolled into it and crawled on the ditch toward the other end where...the ditch was long.</p><p>It wasn't a ditch...after the ditch were far away homes, but not a lot. They were already building. Like this would be the ditch. I was standing here and this ditch was a long ditch, and here were already houses of this area. Here...and part of empty with hundreds and hundreds of Jewish people. I ripped my star off. I left right there and crawled, crawled, crawled, crawled, until I seen a street crossing of the ditch because then the ditch goes under the water goes, so I had to get up. There was not a soul. I just got up. It was dark because in the late afternoon, it was probably, I suppose, it was dark. All...all dark. It was getting dark, but you know, Budapest has a tough curfew because Budapest was a bomb city at that time. It was bombing and dark. So it was really dark and I don't know how. Today, as you told me, and as I went back to Budapest and I didn't find that area and I was looking. As a matter of fact, I was accommodated...in 1977 when I went back with my mother and brother. we went bv the we rented an anartment. vou know. to stav in Budanest. <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> 2 upset. I found it very dirty.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You got back?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In 77 yes. So I got back to this...uh...to the street and I ran. And there was not a soul on the streets of Budapest. And I don't even know how today exactly how I found King street. I know more or less, you know, I remembered naturally where my high school was, the Jewish gymnasium which is in that direction from...when I attended my high school I went from the old apartment where I was born to a certain area where I get...took the tram...tram and go to my high school. So I remembered very well that area and where I was. Now in this ditch area, I thought I knew exactly which is north and south which area I have to go. So I followed my instinct and I got...and this was far away. I have to tell you, this is really far from Zuglo where we were...the David Star must have been. I am sure. 50 miles. I don't know. I am judging because I really don't know. And I was on the street, on King Street because I remember that I went by my little school again in the dark. It's an alley where my ___ was a beautiful old chestnut trees really. And it was already...leaves were already not on in October. They were already fall. Cold.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You walked back to this street?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I walked back to the street and suddenly it was dark. Suddenly, I heard that somebody is also walking, coming toward me and somebody shouted, "Halt," in German. And I froze, because if "Halt," says it must be a German...some...a full German soldier. And good enough, he put the flashlight...I wrote this in my paper because I had it so clearly in my mind. He put the flashlight on my face. There were three of them, three German officers. I don't think they were SS because I'd remember that. And they said, " ." What are you doing here? "Do you speak German?" "Yes" ____------s And I said to him, "I'm going to visit my orandmother. -- She is crank I told him and she's sick. and I just...I'm sorry that I so <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> 3 young women in that building they ever survived. At least to my eyes. There were women like my mother. My mother was born in 1898 and this __ she was not a young girl. Those women were around. Even elderly women were in the building. I remember one, a very old woman who came with us to the ghetto, was at that time 80. She died. She never survived because in the ghetto very many people died.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Magda, before you get there, you have to get to the ghetto.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes. That's very nearby anymore. Yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>q: You are still in the Star of David House. Uh... You had managed to escape.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But I had...I had in my hand and by that particular time I should stress. I remember that very clearly because Havier...going back, then I went to the ghetto. Havier...to Havier, I got the Shutzpass, because Havier said to me in the first meeting that I have to go back and next day when I can get out from the house, I have to bring the photograph. And I have that Shutzpass. My brother will bring it on the 6th. We will give it the memorial. On that...on that time, we had the pass in our hand. My father was...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Before you go to that...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And then came an order...then came an order. Then on that particular time came an other that every David Star house, every, all of them. That means ___, King Street, or wherever they may be because I don't know where they all were around. They all have to move to the ghetto, without exception. So when...and they have to line up on this and this day. I don't remember the date. Maybe Perlasca will remember, maybe somebody else. We were lined up before the building. Everybody of the Jewish people lined up, and the ghetto from King street where the ghetto behind it . [would say...I...1 don't. 1 am thinking now in miles any more, so in miles would be maybe 2 miles because you know the streets are not as long as IT think. in Fifth Avenue. so went to the main boulevard and from boulevard <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> 4</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I had the Spanish pass in my hand. I didn't have any belongings. We didn't have anything.</p><p>We had nothing with us.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Magda, how did you get the Spanish pass?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, I'm now I'm tell you this. Spanish Shutzpass , Havier, again Havier said, "We will give you the pass which _____ and the Legation issuing for the Jewish population you can have. But you bring back the pictures." I brought back the pictures next day right into the people. Havier was there. Havier took the pictures and took me into the room. Now Perlasca told me today, Mr. Perlasca, that I think I gave it to you. And I said, "I cannot be sure, but I think it was Spanish police who gave it to me. But Havier was there. Havier standing by...he said, "I'll see you back again at the David Star house." Because I went back to David Star.</p><p>And the truth is that Havier __ came at night 3 times or twice to the David Star, before we were taken to the ghetto. He came at night, and Anna let him in and called me down and said Havier brought us some food or some bread. I don't remember what else. I remember that he brought me a comb. I do remember that. A comb. Because I didn't have a comb. And he brought this there, and he said..."Where do we go?" I asked him. And he said, "You will be going to the St. Stephen's Park House," and he give the address. Either was St. Stephen Park 9 or 7. [NB: Subsequent to the interview, Mrs. Lapidus remembered that it was #35, not #7 or #9, St. Stephen Park] I have to verify this with Mr. Perlasca because he immediately knew that you were in the St. Stephen's House. And I don't remember...</p><p>although I went back to the building in 77, and even now in 85, I don't remember the number. Anyhow, he told us that that's where we have to go. But apparently there was no...not enough time within the period that I had the pass from Havier and from the Legation. I didn't even understand the connection why the Spanish Legation will issue such thing because I was an intelligent girl,, and I knew that Franco is a fascist. And I know that Franco was neutral. I didn't think about any Blue Division. I learned this from Havier because Havier told me when I asked, "What is your name?" and he said, "My have is Havier , and my name is very famous because there was a Spanish poet in the same name." ] was tellinoe vou this before. and I tell vou how I came to this _ All the time. <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> 5 And I...knowing what ghetto is from not only because I was so dumb. I knew about ghetto. I know... heard of Warsaw. We heard every ghetto... ghetto? Why would I be in a ghetto when I grew up in a civilized surrounding? You know, I was frightened of the word. And I told this to this man. He was an old policeman. A fat, heavy set, mustache, pleasant Hungarian policeman. I don't remember his name. I only know that told him that I told him, "How can we get away? I don't have anything to give you. I...we have nothing?" He said, "You don't have to give me. I bring you out there." You know, in his Hungarian peasant way. We stayed in the ghetto and this street was Old. That's why I remember the street because it's a crazy name. Old Street. But that was Old Street, Old. Which was on the __ of the temple. He said, "I will bring you out." I said, "I don't have to bring me out. I have a mother and my little brother as you see. You have to...three of us, we have to go." He said, "T'll bring you out there." And he did. One evening when it was curfew in the city, he came.</p><p>He led us through the streets because the ghetto was really closed in as you know. But that was not closed in in that time by fence because when I went back to the ghetto in 1945, it was totally closed in with kind of an old fence, and I seen already when the...when the dead people were thrown into the truck. That was already sometimes in 45. So he took us on a very... because we were in a downstairs apartment you know. So he took us out and he said, "You have to run with me." Now you can imagine that Oldsa, the ghetto area, and St.</p><p>Stenhen Park... St. Stenhen Park is in a modern __ that time it was the modern _ still is. - <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> 6 sit back now and take a drink if you like and then while everybody changes their tape....</p><p>End of Tape #1 <span class="page-break" number="11"></span> 7 Tape #2</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We went with car, driving around all night. I couldn't sleep there. I didn't like it. So the next dav we went to the officer. and said. "You must nut us somewhere else." And curiously <span class="page-break" number="11"></span> 8 Legation. The Legation was equally crowded. I was looking for this man because he was my connect...contact at the Legation, so and | asked, "What's your name?" He said, "Havier," I didn't know that time that his name was Havier . I didn't even ask. I didn't care, but I said that he gave me the documents which was...he didn't give me really himself the documents. I think that time police gave me the document. He was only present to give me this document. He came with me out and said, "Keep this document because it's very important. I will let you know. I'll let you know...in that House in David House. Where you live?" And I said, "I am living King Street 95 or 93." I don't remember exactly. And he came. It's true he came. Not the same night. Two or three days after, he brought us food and he said, "We learned that the Spanish protected buildings"...he mentioned a number of them..." You will go to the St. Stephens Park building. And I asked him, "Do I go now or tomorrow when I am free to go out from the building." He said not yet, because the building is not hundred percent arranged apparently with the Hungarian government because I suppose the Legation had to discuss with the government who goes and who doesn't. The buildings were apparently, what I learned later, vacated with everybody who lived in the building and given to the Spanish Legation. All these buildings. The people, they lived in the building, whether they were Gentiles, Christians, whatever, they had to leave the building.</p><p>So they had a hard time probably through this too. Any how, so Havier when he came to the house, to the David Street house, I asked him during the conversation... told him that my father was already taken. He said, "He can be on the document too." And he is on the document, his picture. I said, "Where...how will be this...this departure?" He said, "I'll let you know when you have to go to the St. Stephens Park when it's ready to be...to move there." And on that particular night, I asked, "What is your name?" And he said to me, "My name is Havier ." That's how I remember those years. Forget that many years passed by and that name was in my mind since I speak Spanish, and in the meantime I learned Snanish. I lived in a Latin country and so I was in mv mind. And he mentioned also <span class="page-break" number="12"></span> 9 to...to the Spanish Legation protected house and we just said goodbye and I never went back anymore to the Legation. So in my mind, it's still a mystery who were these people that Havier let me talk. Because we spoke German...Hungarian...I'm sorry. Havier didn't speak Hunearian a word. Mv conversation was with Havier onlv in I mv sood German and his <span class="page-break" number="12"></span> 0 belongings. Can you bring that eventually? And he did. He did bring it to the protected house. Not immediately, but after a few days where we had the two or three pillows in there, so we had some warm...warmer clothing and some pots and pans. But at that time, if] remember correctly, in the building there were no gas, no electricity. Nothing. So the people there had to cook. And my mother had two big bags of flour...I remember that...in the basket.</p><p>Like this. And she didn't...we couldn't eat anything else. My brother and my...we didn't eat anything else during all the time until well after...even when the Russian came in...only snow water was...this was heavy snow...brought in at night from the street by others too in the building, which was made a little fire into the gas stove with the furniture, pieces whoever found it...little wood. Some people went even out...I don't know how they got it...some branches because the trees and the branches were all empty. No leaves. So they brought that in and we made fire on it. And my mother, in one of the pots of snow water, made...we called it, very funny now when that it comes to mind, we called it ___ because it was flat like a pancake, but it was just flour and water. And it was delicious. That's what we eat. That was our staple. Well, we didn't do anything in the building, really. People stuck together if they could. They were bombing in the house...outside in Hungary, and afraid who comes to pick us up because there were a million rumors. Because, you know, you heard all the time, the shootings and the bombings and the time to the Spanish protected house, in the Margaret Island, we knew from rumors that there are still German soldiers and Hungarian autocrats people they tried to...to beat, to fight. And not only that, during that period...that time that we were in the protected house and later on we were upstairs...they accommodated us upstairs.</p><p>And we were on the last floor, and I asked Mr. Perlasca today, "Was it five floors or was it nine floors?" And he said, "I think it was five floors." And I think it was nine floors." We were on the top on this protected house. On...during that period of time, there was an explosion and the Margaret Island bridge exploded totally. All the bridges, by the way, the Hungarians probably did, but we seen it through the window and the windows were all blown in, so there was no windows in the building. I only remember that I was standing in the window and I said, "Oh, my God. The bridge goes." And my face and my hair was full of glass. And all little bloods running which I didn't know. But they says, "What happened to your face?" The little glass went into my hair and cut me. I put this down that there was a professor on the buildins. a Hungarian surgeon. whose name I don't remember and he <span class="page-break" number="13"></span> 1 risked their lives, but we didn't know whether we were protected. Why? Because we heard the rumors that the Hungarian...uh...Nazis, they are going to even to the protected homes and try to take out people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did anybody try to take anyone out of your home?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Absolutely. That's the last time...the building...not the home, in the building. That was the last time I seen Havier, and that's the last time when...I think and I believe that all so Mr.</p><p>Perlasca and other Spaniards were at the building. This was on a...on a morning hours at 5 o'clock. It must have been...I think it must have been end of November.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What happened then?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It happened the following. On early morning, the shouting was in the building...I was actually downstairs at that time with my mother and my brother, downstairs in one of the rooms, and they came...the Hungarian Nazis and they said, "Everybody who is in the building has to come out and line up on the street." Mind you, it was very cold. It was snow, ice. That particular winter apparently was colder than others. And everybody from the building, from top floor, they all have to come. Because some people they even slept on the stairways. They were...I don't know where they were. Everybody has to line up. When we lined up, we just didn't know exactly what will happen, only what we heard. That these people will be marching us directly into the Danube and will kill us. That much I knew. I didn't tell this to my mother and little brother but I said, "This is the end of us. If these people will take us out and the Spanish are not around to save us, we are dead." And it happened to other people I know after the war. To us it didn't happen because... don't know how. That's what I have to find out from Mr. Perlasca. How is it possible that on that morning, suddenly the Snanish Legation revresentative. one of them was Havier with a document in his <span class="page-break" number="14"></span> 2 brother and to others...I'm sure he said goodbye. I only observe what he done to us, and he said, "We are seeing you last time. The Legation must leave Budapest because we are surrounded with the Russians. The Russian come in and close in the city any minute." And I said, "Where do you go, Havier?" He said, "We go to Switzerland. Do you want to come along?" And I said, "How do you go?" I said, "By train and by car, we all...we will leave the Legation, whatever the Ambassador...everybody has to leave. We close the Legation, what he said. And he said, "you want to come along?" And I said, "I will never go without my mother and brother, which is true, and we embraced and everybody embraced. It was a terrible moment. It's terrible even me for now. And he left and disappeared in the blue yonder.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay, at the moment that...that Havier and others argued against the Germans that convinced them to allow you to stay...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They convinced that we should stay. They convinced them that this building is under the Swiss...Spanish Legation, Spanish government protection, and they cannot touch us because they are Spanish. They are diplomat, and they cannot go. And when I read the article is absolutely that's how it...how it was.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was that the last problem that you encountered?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was what is interesting what you asking me because, curiously enough, after that period of time that the Hungarians cleared the way, these Nazis and the Spanish, everybody cleared it away, the misery was there in the house because we didn't know that nobody else will bother us, but I don't recall in my mind, thinking about this million times, that anybody from the Hungarian Nazis, or the Germans or anybody or no Spaniards, nobody came to that building. We were on our own. I only know that there was a heavy shooting, bombing, all this December what I heard...if this was the beginning of December because I don't recall. I don't recall that until the that anvbodv was buesoine the buildings. T don't remember that <span class="page-break" number="15"></span> 3 of November. This was sometimes in the first week or first 10 days of December when this happened and I was confirmed this with Mr. George Perlasca because I think I am one of really the people who are here this gathering who had at least their mind because of my age.</p><p>I really believe that. Because I don't know whether the other remembers in other buildings how it was. I don't know what happened. But apparently it happened to others. I only know from other friends and later other people conversing that in other building...not...not only Spanish, Swedish...the same thing happened, that the Hungarians were there and took them and some of them, took them and shoved them into the Danube. I know that historically. I know that it happened. So while we were saved by the Spanish...that particular morning was saved our lives. This is really the crucial day because it was crucial that they gave us the Shutz pass. It was crucial to me that I was lucky to meet my old professor who says, "Go to the...with me," because otherwise I wouldn't...my faintest mind wouldn't set on the Spanish Legation because I heard Swedish and Swiss...uh...Swiss...because you hear always a little more. We knew about...already in that time, we knew exactly Auschwitz, Birkenau. We know exactly what's happening outside, but we didn't...I didn't know Spanish Legation, so this was really...they were our saviors. No question about it. My life and my mothers and my brothers, definitely!</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's a wonderful statement. As we draw the interview to a conclusion, if we can just go back now to the realization that you have, that the war was ending and...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was a...that was a...that was also very emotional moment, I'll tell you. Because when nothing happened, when it was fairly quiet to...to say fairly quiet that nobody came to take us out or shoot us, but we heard the shooting and people in the building, you know, men. They were men. They were all talking. Everybody was rumoring, "Where are the Russians. The Russians are near." Because we heard...I knew from _Havier. Havier told me. Remember he said that the Russians are all around the city, you know, and it was such a shooting, you know, everywhere that we knew that they come any day. Every day we said now, today, tomorrow. But December the 25th was the worst night of my life of the bombing because we were upstairs and Budapest was sounding like a drum. Boom, boom, boom. And I was so upset and we were so hungry and we were so miserable that I told myself and God should forgive me, I said, "Just a bomb should drop on us. It should be a end." It didn't. So it came other days and other terrible days and hunger and hunger and people were helping each other what they can. Some people they just slept. They didn't do anything. And on the 18th of January, I know that we went out from the house where we lived and the professor who cleaned my face with his hands because we didn't have anything, suddenly I heard him saying and I seen him as now...he says, " " And the Russian soldiers appeared in the building. And not one, not two. Many! They came all around the building and ripped off the David Star from us immediately so we thought it will be fantastic. This our...our...this we are alive. Of course, after this horrible thing, there were miserable situations because firstly, we didn't have food. We didn't have water. We didn't know where to go because nobody had homes. Nobody had nothing. So everybody really stayed for quite awhile in the building. I think that I left with my...I left actually with my little brother. My mother stayed. Because I thoucht I'd 90 hack to the street. notto the -- street. to the street. where we had <span class="page-break" number="16"></span> 4 our belongings. And that was already I think in sometimes in the beginning of February.</p><p>Snow! Ice! Misery! Dead horses on the streets, frozen! Dead people frozen on the...on the street. And I took my brother's hand and I was dressed like a mummy because I had a man's pair of shoe. I don't know how. I mean L...I really looked as anybody can look in a war, and I had a scarf on my face, on my head. I had no warm clothing and we said, we go back to and see if we have anything there. We didn't get to __ needless to say, be cause from park, we had to go to this __ district, __ state district. And we went to the modern district and you have to go through the...to the train station bridge. There is...was a big train...have two train stations big in Budapest, east and west. This was the west station, Rios, and through this leads a bridge. And we had to go through this bridge into the area to reach and walk over to our place. And when we got to the bridge before us, there was a woman walking, also in the same miserable condition as we were and they just called...I don't know whether she was Hungarian or Hungarian Jewish. I don't know, but as she went in the middle of the bridge, she was shot. __ went into her and she collapsed on the bridge like an accordion, bleeding.</p><p>And I didn't know what to do, so I ran back with my brother. I... was afraid that we will be shot, you know. Because, you know, there was shooting everywhere in Budapest in that time. And this woman was dead, just collapsed...I have it like an accordion right there in the middle of this...it's not the bridge. It's overpass. Overpass. So I...then I went back to my mother and very much later, a few days or 3 later, we left the house. We went back to the other street where we had friends and we asked if we can be accommodated and we were accommodated there and we stayed there. Terrible condition. No water. No nothing. The Russian were...the Russians were raping, killing, stealing, namely everything else was there.</p><p>It was a horrible period at that time. And we were hoping that my father and brother comes back. Nothing happened.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What...what did you learn about your father?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My father...L...that's...that's a very important question because when we were still in the David Star House and my father was taken with me, we got two post cards in the mail. One came in the name. _T have here the nost card. I will leave to this Museum if thev need <span class="page-break" number="17"></span> 5 directed to her, Mrs. , and was written by somebody else who I don't know...we don't know who it was. And the card says in Hungarian, "Please take this card to Mrs. Mezei," to my mother, and tell her that Hendrik, my father is in Nagycnk in this sugar refinery. Nagycnk, N-A-G-Y-C-N-K, Nagycnk which is near to the Austrian border. Hendrik is in Nagycnk in the sugar refinery but he's unable to write. This is...this is all the post card. So that was the last which we had or still when we were in the David Star house and we kept this. When after the liberation, after we settled into this ____ street house where we could stay because we couldn't go back to our own apartment because every furniture, every piece was stolen.</p><p>There was nothing. We couldn't...strange people lived there. We couldn't get there. When we went back to the ____ street, the second apartment, there were totally strange people...Christian people, nice people...they lived in the building. Nothing was ours. So we were without absolutely any...anything at all. The only thing we survived is..was the basket which was still in the ___ park. And some pots and the pillows and old ragged clothing what was there. And when we went back to ___ street, we had friends. They gave us beds. Two beds and a wardrobe. vou know. kind of a wardrobe and some heln to us this -- hecause <span class="page-break" number="18"></span> 6 war. He...he played soccer all his life so he was very strong man. They said that all these people were lined up again and they were supposed to march from sugar refinery through the Austrian border and I alwavs think that much too tall because that's another <span class="page-break" number="18"></span> 7 in Rio, but the rest they all exterminated. And that's the sad story. And I wish that everybody should remember for generations and generations and generations what people could do.</p><p>And not only to the Jewish people, but the Gentiles too.</p></p></dialogue>
