But he was very anti-Semite - a big anti-Semite. He always asked the Jewish soldiers - I was with six other soldiers in the company, Jewish, they want a schnapps. You know what a schnapps is. They gave it to them and they really gave them a hard time. I didn't gave it to them. I told my lieutenant about it. He said don't give him. He give the Jewish people a very hard time. You know - anti-Semite - like all of them. But the Ukraine... and one time I went, always to the lieutenant with the whole company - 120 people, you went to make exercise - you know in the fields.

You know I was on the border. I wasn't home. I was in the army - not far from Zakopana - where I use to be in the army. We fought with the Germans until Lvov near from Lvov, but they were very tough. The Polish army were - took apart - they have nothing. Horses there. We were running from the Germans. I fought with them a few times, but mostly we were running. I wasn't home when they start to occupy Poland. And until September the twenty-fourth, I was in the woods over there before Lvov over there - you know - you hear from Lvov. And I have to - the Germans took us - said they're going to bomb the woods over there if we don't give up. So the Polish Army give up. I have to give my rifle away. They took us to prison. They took us to prison.</p><p>We were in a big stadium - in a stadium - they call Javorno(?). Because the Germans and the Russian were friends. Stalin made a pact with Hitler. They cut in half Poland. So we were on the side from the Russian side. So they ask us - fifty people wants to go to work to take the ammunition - you know, in the trucks - they go back on the other side when the Germans took it over. So... I have a hard time over there. One sergeant that was over there - a river - told me to wash his horse. He got boots until in the water - I in the shoes. He didn't know I'm Jewish but this time he start washing. I never in my life washed a horse. He give me a brush. He came over and said, "You Polak, you swine." He kicked me in the lower back. Until today - hurts me until today.

You want to go to Krakow we can't get in because it was closed you know. The station, a red light was over there. We can't get in. There was on the train station over there. We stop in Plaszow-Krakow. It was a concentration camp, later I find out. But they want us take to Krakow. They stopped in the train station because he can't get in. It was red lights over there. That was about 4 o'clock, 5 o'clock in the  evening. And a German soldier was sitting like you sit over there, with a rifle - and my car, you know from the train, was I saw him. So I ask him, I can go down - step down, a little bit of air - because this was a cattle train. There was another Polak soldier over there was from my home town. So I start talking to those two Polish girls - about twenties they were. They said to me in Polish, "You better escape from here because if they take you Krakow, in concentration camps, you gonna die over there. The lice gonna eat you over there." So I said to them, "No, we were lucky. We are staying over there until it gets dark. You bring with you (this was a village) those shawls..." Those shawls - you know - women" shawls - a big shawl... "with you." They said okay. So they left. And I know German. I use to go in the school where I live in ?-- . Sol start talking to the German soldier. Oh, I can go drink water that was over there - a water fountain. "Von wo kennen Sie Deutsch," he ask me. Why I can German? I said, "Ich bin von Kattowitz". Kattowitz used to be belong, I told you, until 1918, was Germany.</p><p>"Oh," he said, "you are comrade." You know what comrade is? "Oh, you my friend, Sie werden bald entlassen." He told me that, "You'll go free quick because you're a German - use to be German over there." I ask him once - I can go drink water - twice.</p><p>He told me, "Ja, Sie brauchen doch garnicht fragen." I don't have to ask anymore. "You go when you want." So I went with my friend - drink water. We were still over there and it was dark already. So I went - drink water.

You know Begin - used to be the Prime Minister. He was in the same Polish Army. So I went out in the village. So I changed clothes with a man over there.</p><p>He gave me a old hat with a jacket - a short pants. Not shaved, I looked like a poor man.</p><p>And they feed us a little bit. I have about 100 kilometers - this is about seventy miles - to home. It was a straight road. And that Polak, the other friend, had money. He bought a bicycle. He left. I didn't have money on me, but I had two, three dollars. So they told me, you know what.... They wanted my shoes too. I said, "No. This is soldiers shoes. I have to walk." They told me, "Take the streetcar and go about twenty kilometers - you have farther to your hometown." So I took the streetcar and I stepped down after the streetcar - I had about (how much?) - still I had about forty miles to go  home.</p><p>There was two little cities over there. They're called Cherbina. There was another city, Charnov after this. Cherbina - between Cherbina, Charnov when they took over Poland - the Germans - said this will be Germany until - Charnov. Cherbina with Krakow, this will be occupied - they call occupied. So between those two cities, I wake up in the morning I have still forty, fifty Kilometers to walk. I woke up in the morning, I want to walk. I saw over there two SS people - you know, two SS. It was not a - really a border, but they were standing over there. I had no documents. I was afraid. All of a sudden a Polish guy on a bicycle, he passed the border. So they started yelling after them. They took their bicycles and run after him. I was lucky - very lucky. So I started walking. All of a sudden I see a horse with a wagon - you know, an open wagon - how you call the platform wagon. Not - not in the sides. I saw my uncle with a friend and two women on the platform. I saw my uncle. I say, "hold it. Who are you poor man, Who are you?" They didn't recognize me. "Who are you?" I said, "I'm Berek." I took off my hat.

He gives me five dollars and I went later to a bakery and I bought something. Was not bread but I pay more money. You know - everything was black market. I was not hungry anymore. I started walking home. I lived on a street - I guess it was the corner. I lived here - and I came over here. And at that corner I had about two more blocks to go. At the corner I saw my aunt.

But I do it too - two loaves of breads in half an hour. I didn't stand in line. I saw what's going on later. My father said to me like this, "Go in the Jewish Community Center. Sign over there so you get - a piece of bread - you know - you get over there rations." I said, "I don't wanna go. I escaped from the Germans over there. I'm afraid." He was afraid not to go, so I went over there. I talked to the main man over there. His name was Mottel Marrin. They told me later the Germans killed him. He was no good to the Jewish people later. And I went to him, "Listen, I was in the army eighteen months and I escaped from the prison. Don't send me to work because I saw my friends sweeping the streets." The Jewish people...</p><p>the Germans... "Don't send me over there." It was about two months. All of a sudden they send me a paper to go sweep the street. I said, "uh, uh." I wouldn't go. But hear over the radio home, the Russian side, the Jewish people over there singing Jewish. I said, "I have to escape to the Russian side." A lot of people were escaping because they have many Jewish people alive now on the Russian side. My mother was crying, "You just came back from the army." I said, "I'm not going to stay with what's going on." I went to the street and told the Jewish people not to walk on the sidewalk or in the street.</p><p>They beat up girls over there. They didn't care the young - Hitler jung they call - you know, those young. When they sent me the paper after two months it was already, I think, November. It was colder over there - snow.
