<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Okay, I was born in Regensburg, Germany, which is up the Danube from Straubing, where my family lived, probably because they had better medical care there than in Straubing, so it happened there. My name f-- w -- at that time was Manfred Firnbacher, but when I came to United States and I got my citizenship paper, I did not like the Germanic name of Manfred, so I had it legally changed to Frederick, and I took the middle name of Stephen, which is in honor of my grandfather.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: It was a bunch of thugs. They came and ransacked the place. They couldn't burn it because it was in a residential area and they couldn't get permission from the fire department to burn the synagogue down. So they ransacked everything and I did see the results of it, and I've never seen such a mess of total destruction, like a bomb had hit the place. And when wi -- they -- they came in, just about destroyed everything. When my father came back from Dachau, he had -- we had -- we were ready to leave Germany, we were ready to pack everything.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Anyway, he went there to get the Torahs, he was -- there was jus -- he was told.</p><p>And when he got there, there was a room that had Torahs and prayer books, all kind of religious material just laying in a big heap. Well, he picked up his Torah and he saw all these others there, being desecrated through -- the Torah's supposed to be -- always be standing up. So he took all the Torahs and stood them up. And he saw a box there, so he took one Torah, he put it into this box, and he took the silverware that was there, the breastplate, the -- the silver hand and the crown and he put all that into the box, and he closed the box up. Well, I am not sure, but the -- when they found this Torah after the war, there in the box with all that, it had to be the Torah my father had put in there, cause what probably happened, I surmise that they came -- the Gestapo came by to pick up all these items, and there's this box there, they didn't look in it, and it was left. And somebody probably would say, oh my God, there's Torahs here. If they catch me with this, they're going to cut my head off, send me a concentration camp or do something. So they headed for the war, and after the war was over, they discreetly brought it back and just left it there.
