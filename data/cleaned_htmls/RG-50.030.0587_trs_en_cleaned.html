<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. And I will start with trying to lay the groundwork, trying to find out the world -- a little bit about the world you were born into. Can you tell me where you were born, when, your name, your parents" names, and we'll go from there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Okay, I was born in Regensburg, Germany, which is up the Danube from Straubing, where my family lived, probably because they had better medical care there than in Straubing, so it happened there. My name f-- w -- at that time was Manfred Firnbacher, but when I came to United States and I got my citizenship paper, I did not like the Germanic name of Manfred, so I had it legally changed to Frederick, and I took the middle name of Stephen, which is in honor of my grandfather.</p></p></dialogue>

Brother who had a PhD. in chemistry from the University of Heidelberg, but due to the situation in Germany, he couldn't get a job there.

As far as the horses went, he would go every year at the German-Belgium border, where they had a type of horse like the Clydesdale, heavy work horses. He would buy them as colts, transport them to Bavaria and then resell them to farmers, who raised them.</p></p></dialogue>

An uncle by the name of Solomon Firnbacher also was in the cattle and horse business in Regensburg, which is a little way up the da-- Danube. There were more Firnbachers in the cattle and horse business, and they more or less worked together.

And from the second grade on I was in a one room schoolhouse til later. Now, other things I remember when I was in that school. One day the door was kicked open, German storm trooper at the door, class dismissed.</p><p>Didn't say anything, everybody go home. And I went home along the street. Half an hour after I was home we saw the troops going through the street for the anschluss in Austria. We were right near the border there. German troops just coming through the city, just truckload after truckload. And I guess they were going in the railroad station too, the trains were heading all for Austria. And by the next day we saw them coming back already, cause they had taken all of Austria so raptly. Then I remember another time, I was downtown in the -- in Straubing and I saw a bunch of tanks coming, loads of -- one tank after another, must have been hundreds of them, and they were heading for the Sudetenland, for the anschluss there.</p></p></dialogue>

He got home in early December of deg38, and we had our appointment with the American consulate in January, first week in January. And we went to Stuttgart to the consulate and of course somebody, on purpose I guess, instead of putting the date 1939 on one of the papers, 38, so that slowed everything down, my father had to go back and forth. So they used to come by every other day just about to pick up your passport and take it away from you. So there would be no chance of them getting our passport, we didn't come home from Stuttgart. We went from there to Augsburg, stayed with relatives over the weekend, and first thing on Monday morning, my dad took the train to Straubing, went to get the date changed on that paper, went from there to Stuttgart, got -- saw the American consulate, got everything straight, picked us up late at night in Augsburg, we took th -- in the night, the train back to Straubing.</p><p>And the next train that left for Holland, we were on it to get out of the country.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: It was a bunch of thugs. They came and ransacked the place. They couldn't burn it because it was in a residential area and they couldn't get permission from the fire department to burn the synagogue down. So they ransacked everything and I did see the results of it, and I've never seen such a mess of total destruction, like a bomb had hit the place. And when wi -- they -- they came in, just about destroyed everything. When my father came back from Dachau, he had -- we had -- we were ready to leave Germany, we were ready to pack everything.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: We'll hear that then, maybe.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Anyway, he went there to get the Torahs, he was -- there was jus -- he was told.</p><p>And when he got there, there was a room that had Torahs and prayer books, all kind of religious material just laying in a big heap. Well, he picked up his Torah and he saw all these others there, being desecrated through -- the Torah's supposed to be -- always be standing up. So he took all the Torahs and stood them up. And he saw a box there, so he took one Torah, he put it into this box, and he took the silverware that was there, the breastplate, the -- the silver hand and the crown and he put all that into the box, and he closed the box up. Well, I am not sure, but the -- when they found this Torah after the war, there in the box with all that, it had to be the Torah my father had put in there, cause what probably happened, I surmise that they came -- the Gestapo came by to pick up all these items, and there's this box there, they didn't look in it, and it was left. And somebody probably would say, oh my God, there's Torahs here. If they catch me with this, they're going to cut my head off, send me a concentration camp or do something. So they headed for the war, and after the war was over, they discreetly brought it back and just left it there.

When war ended, they brought them back, the one they still had, just put them anywhere. So that was the story there. So I told them where I wanted the tombstone, I wanted it re-engraved, and of course I wrote my dad and he sent them a very nice letter. I should say not so nice.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Pardon?</p></p></dialogue>

And he told me about ther -- anyway, they had built a memorial to these people. They wouldn't allow them to give them food, or wouldn't let them have water. The people in town came by to help them, and the SS just told the people, get out, leave these people alone. And a lot of them died there, and there was a memorial which is a water fountain, and had the word water written on it in all different languages, wasser, mayim(ph).

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, that's enough to make you bitter. Is there anything else you'd like to add, that we haven't talked about, that you think is important for people to know in the future?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, the -- the important thing is to keep faith and do the best you can, and like some things in Germany, I -- y-you can't -- just can't forgive, it's just something that they did to you.

My father doesn't know whether it was an accident or whether they did it on purpose, they put the year, it was just after the first of the year, it was in January, instead of putting the date 1939, they put 1938.
