<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: A -- difficult to describe. It's -- it's -- it's still with me. So we were -- Gestapo -- again Gestapo came and the -- un -- unexpected, unexpected, I mean. But the to -- about 15 - 20 minutes, I remember one of them leaving, pushed Leo, says hurry up, hurry up, schnell, schnell. And we were taken out of the apartment with very small -- whatever small baggage or luggage, whatever, whatever people took with. And we were assembled at, I think it was the [indecipherable] it was the train station. I don't recall exactly.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Describe your experiences when you first arrived.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We were taken from the train, as I recall. We were taken from the trains onto camion -- trucks. And the -- we were pretty -- from -- from the same community, actually, we were together. And the -- that was long way. I believe the Germans probably had an -- had a -- had -- they don't need the consent, but they -- Vichy, France accepted, or had to accept the Jewish refugees from there. I don't remember how many there were from the whole area [indecipherable] from larger cities. And there were quite a few -- quite a few children actually there. In Constance there were not too many children, there was just Leo, myself and Hootie(ph) and another child was there actually, or teenager, in this -- left in the city of Constance.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you -- it took days to get to Camp de Gurs?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: We --I-I don't remem -- probably two or three days, something like that, because we stopped, I think. As I learned later on, there was -- we didn't -- Vichy, France didn't want to accept us, and they -- the Germans, you know, tried to -- I mean Vichy didn't have much chance there. So in -- we went to the -- got to the internment camp of Gurs, and it rained and it was miserable, and we were taken by truck, and then they -- first, old men out to -- so -- so [indecipherable] Simon  <span class="page-break" number="13"></span>  Interview with Paula Blue " August 7, 2009 [indecipherable] was a cousin to my father, he Hootie's(ph) -- Hootie's(ph) father, and they -- I remember my mom saying please, please take care of my child, this I remember. And ... and Leo got off with the men, and we went on, and I was pretty desperate at that point. And then they had ilot in Gurs, separate ilots which were barbed wire with some of them double ba -- between el -- ilots, I think was double barbed wire, between the ilots.
