I believe the Germans probably had an -- had a -- had -- they don't need the consent, but they -- Vichy, France accepted, or had to accept the Jewish refugees from there. I don't remember how many there were from the whole area [indecipherable] from larger cities. And there were quite a few -- quite a few children actually there.
