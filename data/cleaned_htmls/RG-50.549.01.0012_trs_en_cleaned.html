It will come back to me. Oh yes, Zeviets. It was Zeviets, near Zeviets. And there were approximately 100 partisans, of which approximately 20, 20 were escapees from Auschwitz. And we also had approximately ten Russians and the Russians were, who either parachutists who were dropped. There were 3 of them. Then there were some pilots who were shot down over Germany. And they escaped and came, joined us.</p><p>And then there some escapees from prisoner of war camps. Altogether we had ten. But our unit, the partisan unit was sponsored by the Polish legitimate government which was at that time in London. You know after, after the fall of Poland some of the governmental offices all moved, first to France. And after the fall of France, they went to England. And England was a legitimate Polish government which was the continuation of the government, of the prewar government.</p><p>And we were sponsored by them and by the English of course. And there were drops made in Poland you know of ammunition and other materials. And so we were supported by them. Of course, when the Russian front moved and to Poland, the Russians also established their own government you know Polish government. And they also had their own partisan units.</p><p>And since we were sponsored by the government in, in England, in London, we were again when the Russians came, we were the enemies of the, of the Russians because we were not communist sponsored.</p><p>The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

We told them that they are on their own now. And, and after that we dispersed</p><p> ourselves because we knew that if the Russians came they would deport us to, to Siberia.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I'm very curious about what your activities were like before that happened, what your life</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> was like, the daily kind of. You were living in the mountains.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well the, the really lived mostly and we moved only by night. And day time we did sleep and</p><p> we slept in the open. Many times we slept on the bare ground and when we woke up in the</p><p> evening you know we were covered with snow. And it was very tough. It was not an easy life at</p><p> all. Later on when in January, end of December and January when it became very cold, we took</p><p> over how do you say, a hunting lodge which was deep in the mountains. And we did make a</p><p> tunnel from there because it was close to a stream.</p><p> From the stream we made a tunnel to get into the hunting lodge. So that nobody could</p><p> see whether there was any movement, the movement went through the tunnel and we stayed in</p><p> this, in this hunting lodge. And our activities were we were, you have to remember that this part</p><p> of, where we were and also Auschwitz itself was incorporated into Germany. It was German</p><p> territory. They claimed it as German. And many of the inhabitants, Polish inhabitants were</p><p> evicted. And many of the farms and so on and big estates where the Polish owners were evicted</p><p> and Germans were brought in from deferment parts of Romania and Latvia, Lithuania because</p><p> the Germans were straight and even Russia there were German people living in Russia, in the</p><p> Volga region.</p><p>The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

So our movements we had difficulty in movement. But we did also undertake some where we intercepted some prisoners and we, I know of, of only one instance where we intercepted two Polish prisoners while they were taken from one place or from one camp taking to the main camp. They were intercepted by us and taken. And they were freed.</p><p>Well how it was done that they were convoyed by guards, by two guards, two prisoners and from the sub camp to the main camp on the way they were approached. We had uniforms.</p><p>We also had SS uniforms and we approached them and we told them. that we were representatives of the camp Gestapo, or the political department and that these two prisoners are needed for interrogation. And we signed the papers an gave to the guards and they released them and we took them over. And they came and joined the partisans.</p><p>It so happened that they didn't, one of them anyway didn't survive. He was later on killed in an action. Where matter of fact I had another friend of mine came the night before to this safe house. And we left next night and in the morning this house was surrounded and one of the, the one prisoner who was released by us was the, there were actually four of them and they were all killed with the exception of one. Who hid in the basement of the, of the house and while the Germans tried to flush them out they were throwing grenades into the basement, he always picked up the grenade before it exploded and threw it in the next part of the basement.</p><p>And then he buried himself in one corner of the, of the basement there was you know potatoes, when they grow and I don't' know to do, how do you describe them. Potato and they have light you know they start growing. And people in order to prevent it you know they take it, take these parts off. They grow and he buried himself in there. So when the SS came they knew that there were four prisoners or partisans and they only could account for 3. And finally one of The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

They bound his hands behind him. With a belt. And put him on a truck and were driving him to the camp. Somehow when he was sitting there in the truck he loosened his hands and jumped out of the truck you know and while he jumped out on the road, he hit his and broke his collar bone and smashed his face. But picked himself up and he run on the road. Before they stopped the truck, he got away. And he survived.</p><p>Matter of fact he lived in Canada in Edmonton. And last year he died. He had a heart condition.</p><p>So he was very lucky, he was very lucky.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: These were typical of your experiences then right before the -- A Now we did what did we, you see we, we caught, we couldn't and we didn't' want to kill you know unnecessarily. We had opportunities to you know kill the Germans but the repercussions would be so, so great that it you know that only the unarmed civilian population would be suffering. We didn't want that. But what we did since some of the big farms were taken over by the Germans who were brought out from different parts of Europe, we did tell them that they will have to move out. We were harassing them. And we were also blowing up you know bridges and railway jun, there was railway junctions. That's what we, but we were not intent to killing individuals because we knew that there would be great repercussions you know to the Polish c, civilian population.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>So we, we tried to avoid that. But of course I was only 4 months in the partisans since my escape. And we also of course we had to feed ourselves.

We also took cattle from</p><p> the German farms and so on because we needed to feed ourselves. But the life in the partisans</p><p> was very, very hard. Very, very tough indeed. And many times we also went hungry. If we had</p><p> to if we couldn't get any food from the Germans, you know of course we did buy food from the</p><p> Polish peasants but we paid for it cause we had funds for this. And we didn't want to anybody to</p><p> suffer.</p><p> Now there were, we did have well I can tell you one instance where we did matter of fact,</p><p> I and three other. I was in charge of this action. We went, we were always very close to the</p><p> Auschwitz concentration camp. Quite close. We you know we and one day actually one night</p><p> we went and we, we had to do something and then on the way back we were rather tired. It was</p><p> late at night and I said let's knock on the windows of a hut and let's hope that these are Polish</p><p> peasants. As it happened, he was a Polish peasant and did knock on the windows and he came</p><p> and we told him who we are and whether he could give us a lift. Through the mountains. It was</p><p> quite a distance to walk. And he said oh yes. He will and he right away he got dressed and he</p><p> went to the stables and he you know harnessed a horse and to the sled and we got into the sled.</p><p> And we told him to avoid the main roads, to go you know through the villages and so on but</p><p> avoid the, the main roads because on the main roads there were German transports going and so</p><p> on.</p><p> We didn't want to have any encounter with them. So as we came to one village and it</p><p> was of course snow covered, the terrain and it was rather dark night. But still the reflection from</p><p> the snow you know it was making it. Anyway we came to the middle of the village. As we were</p><p> in the middle of the village, we looked to the sides and there were tanks parked in the, in the</p><p> yards of the, of the peasant huts. And it was an SS unit and we didn't of course. I had to make The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

As we came to the main road a truck, a German truck came out and the road was very narrow and the truck stopped and a sergeant, SS sergeant got out and apparently he had the intention of arresting us and that we are trying to interfere with his war. And but when he saw us four there in the sled, it was the driver, there were five, he didn't' utter a word. He, he realized that we were probably he realized that we were partisans.</p><p>Because on the main roads the Germans had big boards, billboards. The written and warning that the German troops of bandits, they called us bandits. Bandits you know so I'm sure he realized that we were one but he didn't say. Anyway had he uttered something you know we would have to shoot him because, but so we went, we came to the main road. The main road was at that time free and then we went a little bit further to the foothills and we dismissed the, the driver. And we thanked him very much and we then walked there and we went back into the mountains. We had some safe houses in the mountains . it was there were foresters who were at the, we stayed with them. Matter of fact this particular time it was actually the Christmas Eve And then we went to the, to the forest and there we had we came after midnight and we had our Christmas Eve celebration.

It was already past midnight we went to sleep into, in the</p><p> barn. We didn't' sleep in the house. And then the next morning we stayed again through the</p><p> whole day in the barn until evening. Then we went back to our camp.</p><p> Well we went to our camp and you know joined our other comrades. And at one time</p><p> you know the, the Russian, it was then the you, no it wasn't Christmas Eve. Then we stayed</p><p> there until the first of January. We spent celebrated as much as we could celebrate, New Year's</p><p> eve in the mountains. And the Russians were already nearing the camp at Auschwitz.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was that time like, Did you, was there an actual time when you knew you were</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> being liberated. Or</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well we, we knew you know the front movements. Matter of fact, you know for instance,</p><p> one instance we were in the mountains. Again in the night. a whole company of maybe a few,</p><p> maybe a battalion of Germans was marching on the road in the mountains. And we came to the</p><p> road. We didn't take the main roads. We always went, and we had very good guides who knew</p><p> the mountains you know inside and out. You know they were mountain people so we didn't</p><p> have to them anyway. But we came once to a main road and on this main road therefore was a</p><p> whole battalion of Germans marching in the night. And they were withdrawing from the eastern</p><p> front.</p><p> And we came right to, to the edge of you know on the, of the road and we walked</p><p> alongside the Germans. They didn't bother us and we didn't bother. They spoke to us and we</p><p> spoke to them. And then when there was a gap between the battalions we crossed the road</p><p> because we had to go. Of course we wouldn't take on a whole you know battalion of German The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

And they didn't want any bother either. So you know it mutually understandable that they knew that there were partisans and knew that they were, but we didn't interfere with their actions and they didn't interfere with us.</p><p>And in, in January of 45 when, when | don't' know the exact date but probably in the middle, in the middle of January because Auschwitz was liberated a, | think at the end of January on the | think 28" of January. But it was evacuated on the 18" January.</p><p>The able bodied prisoners in Auschwitz were evacuated to deep into the German Reich and they were marched. So in the, in the middle of January when we knew that the front and the Russians are coming close, we an order came from the main headquarters of the partisan unit. Actually the partisan units were called the home army. In, and it was a very well organized organization and was well | mean Poland wide you know not only in the mountains where we were but there were also in the east of Poland you know.</p><p>And what awe heard when they came and they disclosed themselves to the Russians many of them or most of them were arrested and taken to Siberia. And since we knew about it, we said we are not going to the headquarters knew about it, they disbanded. They gave us orders to be that we will be disbanding and go as civilians and they issued us false papers as civilians.</p><p>In the neighborhood.</p><p>So we went after the Russians moved there we went as civilians and we went back to Auschwitz. In Auschwitz I had other friends of mine who came escaped from Auschwitz. We registered ourselves in Auschwitz as former prisoners of Auschwitz. And we got legitimate papers from there. Of course the transport was very, very poor and we couldn't' move very easily but eventually we were able to, to get to Krakow from Auschwitz.</p><p>The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

He was</p><p> also a former inmate in Auschwitz and we stayed with him. And later on when the movement,</p><p> you know at that time there was, the whole front was moving west. And we encountered many,</p><p> many Russians and especially the Russians who near, when we stayed near Auschwitz they were</p><p> always asking us how far is it to the former Polish German border. And we said it was</p><p> approximately it was ten kilometers and we said we were curious. Why did they ask. I said why</p><p> do you ask. He said because once we cross this border then we can do whatever we like.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was it a time of chaos?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, there was a chaos yes. First of all the railroads were disrupted. You know the lines</p><p> were disrupted. You know there were bombings and, and you couldn't' go, you only could go so</p><p> far and then the, the line was the railroad line was damaged and you had to walk for a few</p><p> kilometers and then take another train from there on. and so on. So there was a lot of disruption,</p><p> especially going from south to north. The lines you know going from east to west they were kept</p><p> because that's where you know the movement was and all the delivery of the arms and so on had</p><p> to go this way so they were repaired right away.</p><p> But the other lines you know meaning from north, from south to north, they were</p><p> disrupted yeah. They were not, so it, it was very difficult to move around. It wasn't easy at all.</p></p></dialogue>

And roads. Especially rail. For</p><p> instance I after I stayed in Krakow for some time I think in end of February, I think we, my</p><p> friend who also lived in, in northern part of Poland, not far from home town, we wanted to go</p><p> and we went. And for instance we had to travel mostly on top of the roof of the, of the trains.</p><p> Then we only could get, we couldn't go through Warsaw. We had to take some line. Then and</p><p> we had to walk, to walk many times you know for, for many hundred, not hundred but tens of</p><p> kilometers. And finally we did get to, to nearby west of Warsaw and there we got a train, a</p><p> Russian transport train which was delivering petrol or what you say, gasoline. You know to the</p><p> front cause the war was still on.</p><p> So we got on this tank, tanker and I, I had an accident. I put my foot in order you know to</p><p> sit under the big tank you know and just on some railing you know. I tried to prop myself up</p><p> and I put my foot in a coupling you know where the trains when they, the coupling. There was</p><p> an opening. I put my, my heel into it. I wore, I had a German jackboot you know which I took</p><p> from a German. And it had a very strong heel. Anyway I put it in there. And while the train was</p><p> pulling you know there was a gap and I didn't' realize that after it started braking it stand you</p><p> know and the opening closed and it caught my heel. And matter of fact, I thought that I lost my</p><p> you know my, my heel. That it was crushed. Because right away you see the, the boot. Broke,</p><p> the leather broke.</p><p> And I felt tremendous heat you know in the whole foot. But I couldn't' pull out, I</p><p> couldn't' do anything until the train started to pull again and then I was able to feel my foot.</p><p> And, but and I asked my friend because my friend was sitting next to me, to hold me in case I</p><p> lost consciousness. You know so that I wouldn't' fall under the wheels. And, and then finally</p><p> the, the train came to a stop at a station and we got off and I went to a first aid station but they The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

And back</p><p> in America with by that time I specialized in reinsurance business and I got a job with a company</p><p> which was part of CIT financial corporation and they bought me back and they paid for my</p><p> passage and the furniture because when I went to England we went with all our furniture.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well you know when I, when I think back you know that maybe I would have done</p><p> things differently you know in some ways and I, I just know that I wasn't quite you know. I you</p><p> know I never tried because for instance I never tried to talk about it. I didn't want to talk about it.</p><p> I didn't want to recall it. So I kept it you know buttoned up. And I did you know then try for</p><p> compensation and but it was a very (minimal?) compensation which I did get. And I didn't ever</p><p> follow this through.</p><p> I probably because as a people in same circumstances as I you know didn't get much</p><p> more money out of the German government but I just really didn't', didn't want. All I did get, I</p><p> got 1800 dollars I don't know what year it was out of just a lawyer took 400. And I think I got</p><p> 1400 which you know it's nothing.</p><p> But you know I probably could claim on some physical disability or mental disability or</p><p> something of the kind. I didn't. I was lucky and grateful that I came out alive and I don't' think</p><p> that I have any physical disability or mental disability. Although maybe you know that</p><p> something was playing on my mind anyway because it had to leave some, something you know.</p><p> The things which I saw and experienced.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh no not really I couldn't tell you but I think they started much later than, not right at</p><p> the beginning because I tried to push it away and I think I pushed, I was very successful at</p><p> pushing.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You also have had incredible survival skills. And how has that shaped you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes well I can tell you that from the first moment when I was arrested I thought of</p><p> nothing else but how to get out. How to I never did give up, never did. I never lost you know</p><p> hope. And I never, and I, I have tried, always tried to be very inconspicuous. I, I knew many</p><p> people in the camp you know who tried to be very heroic you know and, and I, I realized right</p><p> from the beginning that the best way was to be do yourself, but keep quiet you know to yourself.</p><p> And not to try to be a hero.</p><p> But I never gave hope, up hope you know of surviving and I never gave up hope of</p><p> escaping. It always was on my mind to escape. Matter of fact the first day when they arrested me</p><p> I already thought to escape while they were arresting me. I just you know didn't know enough</p><p> because we were, we came to the prison. It was a reception room which was close to the exit</p><p> room. And you had to go in order to escape you had to just had to go out of the reception room.</p><p> Then you had to go through two gates. You know where there were guards. I thought that, I</p><p> thought since I didn't speak E, German you know that I would bluff my way through the gates,</p><p> you know because at that time there were still Polish guards in the prison.</p><p> But I, I am afraid I didn't' have enough courage and I didn't know enough you know how</p><p> the whole prison system operated.

And maybe</p><p> they would let me through. But I didn't do it. But I did think, I never as I said, I never lost hope.</p><p> Never lost hope.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And the courage to take that chance too. Where does that come from? because a lot of</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> people were afraid to take the chance because they might be killed.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't know I really, it's very hard to express. You either have it or you don't have it.</p><p> We, when I tried to escape from Auschwitz we had a different plan and to escape and when the</p><p> time came we tried to escape as civilians and one of the fellows just couldn't it. He just couldn't</p><p> do it. He was shaking like a leaf. And he said I can't do it, and we had to abandon him. And so</p><p> we could do it. I did. I, I don't say that I was not afraid or you know but, but I took the chance.</p><p> And we had very close, very close calls during the escape. We had close calls but we made it.</p><p> You know but we believed in ourselves and we believed in that we will be successful. So we</p><p> were, but I took the chance and you know for we also knew what consequences would be if we</p><p> didn't succeed. And we were prepared for this. That we had the poison, you know the cyanide</p><p> that we would take.</p><p> And kill ourselves because we knew that we would be killed anyway and tortured before</p><p> being killed.</p></p></dialogue>

I think we, we were more united you know during the war than we are now. And I am talking about Poland. We were because we had a common enemy.</p><p>You know we had a common which was Germany and we were all united and we were all fighting you know to survive. Not that there were no, no exceptions. You know there were exceptions. Many, some of the Poles you know collaborated, but there were very few. Nobody in Poland collaborated who was on the top you know. I mean of any stature. Like in different countries. Like for instance in, in Norway, Quisling you know who collaborated openly you know with the Germans.</p><p> In Poland we didn't. We were, and we were all united. Now it, it changed when the you know when the Polish government, the Communist government came to power you know then it changed. There was no unity. And people you know there were some, those who were Communist you know. They were you know pro-Russian and the others were opposed to it.</p><p> And, and the division started, but not during the war.</p><p> Now people can say you know that many I think especially as I don't know whether you know but Poland had I think one of the largest you know minority Jewish population minority in Poland, in, in the world. There were over 3 million Jews. Now many Jews, the Jews accused us that we didn't do much more to help the Jews. I think the Poles did more than any other country you know. They, you know to the Jews. And they did it with great risk to themselves, you know because the Germans were particularly you know against the Jews and anybody who would help them. So you know the, they just I think they are not fair you know in, in this assumption.</p><p> Not all. Many Jews are very fair. You know and they especially this book you know for instance says.</p><p> The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Say the name of the book.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh the name of the book is Hitler's Willing Executioners you know by Daniel Jonah</p><p> Goldhagen. He is very fair in, in his assumption. For instance I heard well many Jews say that</p><p> the concentration camps were in Poland because of the, the Poles being not accessories but</p><p> helping or willing you know to, to, well which is complete nonsense. The only thing is that</p><p> Poland was centrally located in Europe and the biggest concentration of Jews was in Poland and</p><p> it was out of logistic you know things that they, that the concentration camps were there, not</p><p> because of anybody, because the Polish population wanted to.</p><p> On the contrary you know they never found, found any Poles who would help in the</p><p> destruction of the Jewish population. But and here and this author of this book you know says</p><p> that mostly those who helped the Germans were the Lithuanians and the Ukrainians. And the, it</p><p> is a fact because there were Ukrainian units you know SS who were helping the, the Germans.</p><p> So I think the record should be kept straight. And you know fair is fair.</p><p> I don't say that there were not people who, who betrayed Jews but then on the other hand</p><p> it was also in some cases where the Jews betrayed Poles. So we have to be very, very careful and</p><p> you know and, and fair. And honest.</p></p></dialogue>

I was much more emotional when I</p><p> spoke. Matter of fact I, my first talk was to a Rotary club. I was not a member of the Rotary Club</p><p> but they asked me to speak and, and I didn't know how I will, it was a very emotional speech, so</p><p> I was told. I mean I didn't listen.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What kind of conclusions have you come to about all the reasons for why this happened.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well you know there, there is all, especially here in this country once you know from the</p><p> Jewish community one hears you know well the Polish anti-Semitism and they completely</p><p> disregard you know the German anti-Semitism. Anti-Semitism I think is everywhere. You</p><p> know it is in America and this and any other country. But the intensity of it may be in Poland it</p><p> was more intense because there were more Jews. But they completely disregard the intensity of</p><p> the anti-Semitism which was in Germany.</p><p> And, and that's where it all started. And I, I forgot.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Just the reasons why did this happen?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> A And now the reasons were first of all you know the, the anti, anti-Semitism you know</p><p> existed in Germany. And of course it was how do you say. It was can't find the proper word. It</p><p> was intensified by the regime, of the Nazi regime. You know their policy was the extermination</p><p> of Jews and it was not only the, it was the policy of Hitler and, and, and since the ground you</p><p> know the anti, anti-Semitism was there anyway, it you know when, when they came with the</p><p> propaganda you know against the Jews it fell on very fertile ground. And that was the reason</p><p> why you know the.</p><p> Now why there was anti-Semitism. Anti-Semitism was because most of the Jews were</p><p> quite prosperous. I, I am talking about Germany. In Poland you know we had many, many, very</p><p> many poor Jews. But in Germany most of them were quite prosperous and there was hate and</p><p> jealousy and this all contributed you know to, to this problem of, of the, the Jewish problem.

We first of all Poland was a rather poor country.</p><p>And, and you know we had a minority, a Jewish minority of approximately 10, ten percent, close to ten percent. And then and we also had in prewar Poland we had a minority of Ukrainian minority of 15%. So and I think the Ukrainians are even more hateful you know more anti-Semitic than, than the Poles were. But, but, but you know the Poles were not to the extent.</p><p>They always say there were Polish pogroms. There were no Polish pogroms because the pogroms which were existed you know were during the Russian occupation of Poland. Anda pogrom has to be sanctioned by the government. And in Poland during the, the existence you know after the First World War, the, between the two world wars you know which Poland was in existence for 20 years. It never was any, anything, any pogroms sanctioned by the Polish government. But the pogroms were sanctioned in you know as we know in, in Germany and in Russia and we know what happened you know to the Jews you know during the last war.</p><p>We know that 6 million of them were, perished.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: For you personally what does it all mean and why did it happen.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well L I think it happened you know the Holocaust happened because of, of hatred which was you know and the hatred you know they vented it, they more or less, Hitler blamed the Jews and made a scapegoat of them for all the ills in Germany and in Europe that well and you know and there are many reasons.</p><p>One reason is for instance as far as the Catholic church is concerned you know that they blame the Jews for killing you know Jesus. But you know so, so you know so the Catholics The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

And very educated most of them. And very clever. You know and</p><p> this you know is also cause for hating. So that, that there are many reasons.</p><p> I think the reasons are also very well described in this book which I mentioned you know the Hitler's Willing Executioners. He, he very well describes you know what how, what was the cause you know to this holocaust.</p><p>And of course they and it was popular for the Germans you know for the Nazis it was a</p><p> very popular thing to do because it united and anybody today nobody talks about German anti-</p><p> Semitism. I don't' know why. Of course there are not many Jews left in, in Germany. But there</p><p> neither are there any many Jews left in Poland and yet they always talk about the Polish anti-</p><p> Semitism.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Something just I hearing your experiences how do you think people can be so cruel.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> How can they have all that hate.

And you know the hatred, the you know they had</p><p> publications. The publications and | think it was Sturmer which was a the publication of</p><p> the Julius Streicher who was one of the greatest you know haters of the Jews. So you</p><p> can inflame this in a propaganda. Goebbels | think he was a master of propaganda.</p><p>The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I'm just thinking --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think it, and I think it's you know it you will find cruel people in any nation, in you</p><p> know there are sadists you know.

And as a clerk I had to keep the evidence of the prisoners you know. How many prisoners there were and who went to another block and so on and so on.</p><p>Well one and there were reports you know the roll calls were twice. And well at first there were 3 times a day and then afterwards they were twice a day. And at one evening roll call, I got a from the main office you know that one prisoner had the next morning had to be delivered you know to the main office. And apparently I was not supposed to tell in this until after the roll call. But I told him before the roll call. Now what this fellow apparently knew or suspected what is going to happen, that he probably will be executed so I and I told him this before the roll call so when I told him, he disappeared.</p><p>But we were already in the compound and he couldn't escape. It was impossible to escape from there but, but what happened he, he hid himself in one of the blocks. One of the blocks that was being built and he between the scaffolding you know he hid himself. Of course in this delayed the, the roll call because they had to find him. And they found him very soon afterwards.</p><p>So afterwards you know the, the block head he fired me right away. He said you know you shouldn't have told him this and he fired and I was punished to be sent to very heavy work and, and the SS told him that I, that he should watch me that the heaviest possible work would be assigned to me. So when we came back after the roll call one of the fellows said why don't you hit him. You know because he caused you so much grief. I said why should I hit him. I just couldn't, I why should I do this. This poor soul you know probably will be dead tomorrow and why should do it and what would it do to me.</p><p>The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

I just couldn't, couldn't do that and I wouldn't' do it.</p><p>couldn't, couldn't do another human being. That I am, how I felt and I never did anybody any harm.</p><p> But there were people you know there were people. There were prisoners themselves you know who behaved very, very, very badly. And they were punished later on. And, and look it, not only was limited you know to the German prisoners because there were German criminal prisoners. There were also Polish prisoners you know who were very, very cruel to other people.</p><p> And there were Jewish prisoners who were cruel. They there were Jews who were also you know block elders you know and who behaved.</p><p> One has to understand that some people thought that if they are going to be cruel or be very tough on other prisoners that they will save their own skin. You know the, the, the instinct of survival was very, very strong in everybody and some people thought through cruelty to others you know they will save their skin and others as I think in my case you know I just tried to be inconspicuous you know and, and just behave. You know as a human being.</p><p> I also you know there, there were prisoners who for instance were stealing from other prisoners you know bread you know which was punishable. If you were caught stealing another prisoner's bread which was you know our, our you know food was very meager, it meant that this guy, the other prisoner from whom you stole the bread, he probably is going to die. So it was punishable by death and it was punishable by death, by the prisoners themselves you know it was, they took him to work. Some of the capos or something. He was told that this fellow stole the bread and they, they killed him. So there were many terrible things you know which I many times I don't want to recall them.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you ever wonder why you survived and what your purpose is?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well I, I think I survived first because I wanted to. And secondly I think I was lucky.</p><p> And I used my brains or you know my abilities the right way. And that was the reason I, I did</p><p> survive. And the will to, to live. The will to live. It's a very you know the instinct to survive is</p><p> very strong in human beings. And if you lose this, if you lose your will to live, you know then</p><p> you are finished. Might as well lie down and many did you know, many people in Auschwitz</p><p> did. Lose the will.</p><p> Of course it's brought on by, by mistreatment, by hunger. You know specially by hard</p><p> labor. But you know I think it's also a lot of luck to do with it. You know if you're lucky and</p><p> know and help you know strength you know, help each other.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Even now.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh well, now, now my purpose well I just want to have you know a quiet and</p><p> comfortable life you know. And health. You know in older, it's all important this health you</p><p> know. Of course you know even it all depends on the genes you know which you were born.</p><p> Some people are, live longer, others shorter you know and I think I my father when he was he</p><p> died, he was 90, almost 94. 93. And he, he you know he died because he fell, fell and hit his</p><p> head and probably could have lived longer. My mother died because after operation she had an</p><p> operation and she died there when she was 79.</p><p> So now the purpose and the purpose is also I want to say and that's why I speak to the</p><p> youth, you know in the high schools and the at college you know the, I want people to know</p><p> what it was. Maybe it, it may be in this way it can be prevented in the future. For anything like</p><p> this to happen again. That, that's the purpose. And as I said I couldn't' talk about it and I</p><p> wouldn't talk about it, but now I do and I realize that you know that's why I also wrote my</p><p> memoirs because I wanted to put it in writing what happened. I didn't write everything and</p><p> didn't' see everything. You know there were things and other prisoners probably saw more, more</p><p> of the horrors you know than I did.</p><p> But I saw a few of them and believe me it is enough. What I saw for any human being to</p><p> see.</p></p></dialogue>

She is a Jewish Polish Jewish girl and she worked in a typing pool, next to</p><p> my office when I worked in, I worked in the central building administration building. And she</p><p> was in the typing pool. There were approximately ten, ten Jewish girls. She was the only Polish</p><p> girl. There were Slovakian girls, Hungarian girls, and one Dutch girl. I think one German girl</p><p> and there were altogether ten and they all spoke both, their own language and German and they</p><p> could take shorthand you know in German.</p><p> And, and I met her. They all survived. They were all Jewish. They all survived. They</p><p> were evacuated from, from Auschwitz and I know from her because I met her in London, she</p><p> told me that they all survived.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No you know because I was busy. I concentrated on my work and I didn't. I just put it, I</p><p> think in this respect I have the ability to do to put it aside you know and I think that's what kept</p><p> me sane ,that I have this ability to push it out of my mind.

You can't avoid it when you start talking</p><p> about it.</p><p> Now you know the worst part in Auschwitz to me anyway was the uncertainty which,</p><p> under which we lived. You know although I did work you know. I had a job. You know I</p><p> worked in an office afterwards and I was not mistreated, although I didn't have any more food</p><p> but I, I had an easy, easy work. But the, the uncertainty of life.

I, I think in my transcript I did say that I, I was lucky to escape gassing only by, by a few hours you know.</p><p>So, so you see that that was the un, then what prompted us also to escape was that we knew that the, the end of the camp was nearing because the front was you know we had good information because we had the r, radios. I worked in the workshops you know and there were electricians who always got the radios for repair.</p><p>And they of course when they, once they repaired the radio they kept it and they tuned in, into the BBC you know and so on.

Now maybe you know this was a result of the war. You know we hated the Germans. And whenever we could hurt them you know we tried to hurt them. And, and you had to be cunning and crafty you know to, to cheat you know. To, to do anything you know to not to help them you know succeed.
