<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: They all walked to Lvov?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="4"></span>  8</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. How they managed, I can't tell you. It wasn't too pleasant but they came to Lvov.</p><p>In Lvov, was already the Russians.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The reason I asked is that some people often say that their parents said that all the Germans were nice people, they had known them before the war and that kind of a thing?</p></p></dialogue>
