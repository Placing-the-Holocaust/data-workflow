<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Then you, you grew up in Prague?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not entirely, no. I grew up in, I started out to grow up in Prague. Before I was four years old, I was almost four years old, my parents moved from Prague to Vienna.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Which was the old, in the same country, Prague was in Bohemia, which was in Olsten (ph) Province.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Now, I'd like to focus in on the years before, of course, you began with emigration to Palestine and all that. How did you get involved, first of all, in the Zionist movement and specifically with Betar (ph) and revisionist and Zionism. You were involved before you began in, before 1937...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. I recall that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did you get involved?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I had an uncle Siegmund (ph) Korn (ph), who was a member of the First Zionist Congress in Betar (ph) and he was a convinced Zionist and interestingly and he explained to me <span class="page-break" number="0"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> about the Jewish history and about the Jewish building a nation on their own as soon as, who would understand and I was, from the beginning, when I knew that nationally, ethically I am a Jew, was an important issue in Prague, because Prague was the capital of Bohemia and there was a fight for the languages there, between Czech and German, the Jews all held to the German side and all spoke German while most of the population spoke Czech. But, I was brought up by the incubel (ph). We had a maid, with whom I spoke only Czech and my parents spoke only Czech with me for the purpose of, that's why Czech is my mother tongue because they said, "German you'll always learn, but you should speak Czech." And so I was brought up by the incubel (ph).</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So how old were you when, this, your uncle, had this effect on you? Were you still a child?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was four years old. I don't remember any effect at this time, but I remember that when most of Vienna started using for drawing pencils, pencils of the Jewish National Fund and he explained it to me what the Jewish National Fund was that it buys land in Palestine and that we will have, that we always had our country there and that we will have our country there again.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. And do you remember anti-semitism growing up?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, I sure do. I remember shouting in Vienna when I came to the playground. I was sometimes asked, I don't know, sometimes, but I remember , where I was asked, "Are you a Jew?" and I said, "Yes," and the boy, the student said, "Well we can't play with you," and I asked, "Why?" So this boy said, "Because you killed Christ." And I said, "I didn't kill anybody." He said, "Yes, you killed Christ." I said, "No" and then he said, "Then you father did." He was born (ph) insolent. And then there was when you traveled in the trains, you, there was a certain habit that if you were in the train and if there was a with you and you were <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. I went first to elementary school, a special elementary school that my parents sent me to. It was a school that was run by the City of Vienna as a letter-building , a training school for teachers. And , you are supposed to go five years to elementary school and then to the middle school or to the gymnasium, but you could after four years already miss any particular examinations unless you skip the fifth year as I did (ph).</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: At what point did you actually get involved organizationally with a revisionist, with Betar (ph), how old were you, what...?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I was involved at about 16, 17 years of age. Yes, but I had been before at the Zionist Congress in Carlsbad in about 1920 with my father, nearby in Marinebarton (ph) and I, <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, but I was before this already very much in the Jewish Student Movement. I was in the Jewish Academic Israel, that was one of the corporations which had been Zionist from the beginning of Zionism and I had, yesterday only I got a postcard I think it's not a postcard, I think it is a photocopy of Heffa (ph) in which he writes to Israel, "To my dear <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> would not, they would throw us out anyhow, so I started it. And this is very interesting political , the rector(ph), the do you director, too?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Director of the University, Paxton (ph) Manificos(ph) was exchanged from year to year from one faculty to the other was at that time the initver (ph), the name was I-N-I-T-V-E-R, and he was a theologian. He was applied by the theologian faculty and he was a priest and he was___and I told him, "You don't think that I would be crazy to start a fight; how many are we and how many are the others?" And of the newspapers in Vienna, they are largely in Jewish hands and liberal, very liberal, and they looked out for the chance to hear to have the director of the university who was a theologian and he was then finally called to this panel and he announced that I am being warned.</p><p>That was all. I could have been excluded from the university , because he had told <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> this vision was that the Viennese Jews in their mass (ph) were least protected by these Jews very conscious of their Jewish culture.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, how specifically did you get involved specifically with the Betar movement and revisionism, which is obviously a very logical specific type of Zionism?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: There was at this time a discussion going on whether the Jewish, whether Zionism was really a state or was it a strong movement that we want a bi-national unit at the time and those people, and I knew about it and I was always radical. I was for the state and by then I went into the Congress, I went for the first time in 1935 to Israel when I was...1935, I was 29 years old. I went to Israel, but before this 1935 I went to the Congress in Zurich (ph). Aisha (ph) was a friend of mine. And then I heard Gobutinski's (ph) speech. But I heard him, then I formally joined, like I had heard him already in Catovitz (ph), which was a revisionist a few years before this, as I was very much impressed. He was a most impressive personality. I knew him well. A book came out recently by Shotz (ph) in manages very permanently (ph).</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was it about Gobutinski that impressed you, that type of Zionism?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, it was not only the Zionism, it was the personality. He was an excellent orator and then he came to Vienna. Everybody went to hear him. He didn't advertise what he's talking about. They had a big placard that said, "Gobutinski's Speech", "Gobutinski ." And that was <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> anywhere. By law, incorporation to which every Jew belongs whether they wanted to or not. And to put, they tax you. If you didn't pay your tax to the Jewish community, the tax of the government taxed your property. They had very officious tactics, this Jewish community.</p><p>There was only one way to get out, to declare ousted (ph) of the : "I don't want to <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> the Vierra De Tripoli (ph) and he said, "We ride the boat to go to the Vierra De Tripoli (ph)?" But if we don't come to the Vierra De Tripoli, it was only the batterime (ph) will force the __ to go to Palestine instead and there will be a big stinking develop because Jews from good houses that pilot the ship and go to...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You wanted the publicity...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We wanted the publicity in order to point out to the world that in spite of the need to, a land to go to, in spite of what the League of Nations has decided on the strength of that this should be a Jewish nation alone, Palestine, that this is not being done. And..</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was this successful?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: This is what was suggested to me. His name was Shriebelstein (ph) G-R-I-V-O-L-H-E-I-N (ph) Moshe Grivolhein, Galinin. He changed his to Galinin (ph), and I saw a different _--._--"I said, "This propaganda is very good, but we can do better. We can bring the people in and try to smuggle (ph) them in." He said there would be no problem with the because the problem <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What part did they leave from in Europe?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Different...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Different.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Different parts. First you came by train to Greece and then left from Athens, but the problem was that the British demonstrated, the British government demonstrated, with the governments of those countries, that they supported by letting the Jews in. But we needed, they said, "How do you know __illegally into Palestine?" They said, "Because they don't have a visa to go anywhere to." So, we had a man, Dr. Diamand, a very educated scholar, who told us, we formed a small group, The Axion (ph), who was the active action group within the revisionist party, about five or six people, and he told us, "You know the danube is international, it is an international treaty about the danube that you can go down the danube without visa to the seaport, because Britain now intervenes with all these countries, with Slovakia, with Hungary, with Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Romania, that they shouldn't let our ships through. Well, our ships went through without problems, without visa, so we went down the danube until they came with and we did not know, generally assumed, and I am always asked, "How did you get out?" It was no problem to get out; the problem was to get in!</p><p>The problem with all of them is the very end, then the problem to get out, of course, it was not possible to get out anymore, because at the same time it was closed, the borders were closed and it was after the Panzer (ph) conference and you can't get out anymore.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Clearly, in the 1930's which we're talking about now, so you're saying the problem wasn't leaving Europe, the problem was nowhere to go, who would accept Jewish refugees at the time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: The Germans helped the people travel up in German down the danube with us <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And when you talk about, when you mentioned, you referred before to the Jewish pirates, did they literally force the ships to go to...</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No. The plan was changed. The plan was changed. They smuggled course and the was a seagoing ship to little boats and the first ships there was nothing on it, no arrangement had been made on the land. They just jumped into the water and fought around, just jumped into the water and swam the little place intending to look for Jewish places where they could hide, but soon the __ took over the distribution.</p><p>Q. Right, so, so the first few transports were, in fact, successful?</p><p>A. Very successful, because we boated people out. We didn't have so many.</p><p>Q. When was the first time a ship was caught, I mean, by the British, you know, at Palestine?</p><p>A. I believe the first ship which was caught was at Pareta (ph). Pareta was on the high seas and could not land nowhere. The British had organized and they came too near the border and the British Navy was there and the Air Force, the British Air Force and they blocked their advance so they retreated at Pareta (ph) to some barely little Greek Islands, inlets, in the sea there and seen some and so on and then they got out and they couldn't get <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 1</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And the Aunschluss (ph) and that day and the period following it, do you remember that day?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: That morning I was in the house of a friend of mine for a sabbath meal Friday evening when we knew all the time that the situation was very dangerous for us there and there was a notice that the Russian (ph) chancellor had received an ultimatum from Germany for complete surrender and Churchill went on the radio while we were eating just after the lighting of the candles and said that he had gotten an ultimatum from Germany to surrender and he does not want to shed blood and that is why he surrenders and that was, that was it. <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 2</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The first day Nazis went to the houses of the members of the leaders of the community and they arrested the president of the community, Dr. Davidof (ph) Friedman, who perished, was killed.</p><p>They arrested Dr. Yachov Ehrlich (ph), who was the, represented, only the regional representative of the Vienna City Council and he was brought to Dachau and four or five days later, there was listed the Viennese community got a letter from the Jewish community in Munich that, "We have the remains of Dr. Yachov Ehrlich, who died in the concentration camp at Dachau. If you want to have the remains, will you please send, tell us to..." and then everybody knew that this means business.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now you were summoned to the office of Eichmann...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I was actually not summoned. I went there because there was older leaders of the organization were summoned to the office, to the Zionist organization's office, which was in the Marcraurel (ph), after the Roman Emperor who founded the City of Vienna, Marcraurel (ph), I think the houses the Zionist offices. And there the leaders were summoned there. But the leaders had fled. and Wolfhef Hofiver (ph) had fled and I was one of the, the three people who <span class="page-break" number="11"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 3</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: He was threatening your life if you didn't...</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: What?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was he threatening your life if you didn't?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Sure, he put his gun into my (cough), into my back and said, "I'll give you a second, a second..." How did he put it? He said, "I'll give you a second naber (ph)." And I didn't, he didn't count down yet. And he said, "Now, I'll count down to three and if you don't tell me about where Diamand is and where I can find him, I'll give you, I'll make you a second asshole," and he went a little lower with his rifle, with his gun, which was not a rifle, it was a pistol. And I really did not know him. So I told him, I did some fast thinking, but I was full with fear. I told him, "I don't know about Diamand, but I can tell you something which is much more important for you. It is political information about the possibility of Jewish organizing emigration."</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So he was receptive?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: He was receptive. He went and he was interested in other members of the Betar (ph) who were</p><p> Erick Deutsch, who was my best friend. Erick Deutsch and I and two or three <span class="page-break" number="12"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 4 listen to him. And he said, "The Germans want equality. We should not give them equality. They want equality of arms; they want equality of freedom of trade. None of this do they deserve and a man in the audience, a heckler, got up and said, "But Mr. Gobutinski, denying equality means a denial of our own history." And the Betar wanted to get this heckler, to kick him out, and he said, "No, I'll tell you. I'll tell you and, a story." "There was once in Paris, in France, a very well-known patriot, a Marquis who was very patriotic every time the Marciess (ph) was played, or sung, he got up, whatever the conditions and saluted (ph) and one night burglars broke into his house and he reached for his pistol under his pillow and while he, but when as soon as they started, one of them jumped to the spinet and started to play the Marciess (ph) and this Marquis was standing in his nightgown in his bed, saluting, while burglars robbed him of everything he had. What was this man? He said, "Marciess (ph) or the storyteller." "The Marciess is whole (ph) but this man was an idiot!" It doesn't have a lot to do with holocaust, but it tells you a little bit about what type of personality Gobutinski was and, of course, :</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So you say the primary concern then was not trying to regain equality but getting Jews out of Europe?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Specifically to Palestine?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I read this memorandum, I told him I would give him a memorandum and I made out a memorandum which I had to translate into English because the German is so poor I had a carbon copy of it, but the carbon copy is not so good. I think I gave a carbon copy before to the museum, I don't know. But it is very poor, it is hardly legible, and I am now about to translate it, it is three pages long and so at the beginning of the second page it is dear to us and making the Germans understand that this is not really doing something very illegal ___--. Of course, it was illegal, but this memorandum by ____ about, I didn't hear from him, about 10 days later, which I don't know whether it was 10 days, my feeling today is I was sitting in, I was sitting in the outside in the anteroom to the president of the of the Jewish community and Eichmann was one <span class="page-break" number="13"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 5 pointed me and said, "Oh Cesar (ph) assume Oh Cesar (ph) ". <span class="page-break" number="13"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 6 happy Vienna return of Austria to Germany has never been part of Germany.</p><p>Germany has been part of Austria.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When you were in Berlin, which Nazis did you speak with?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't know his name, but I know, you see, I went to the Ministry of Economics, used to be Ministry, to get permission to use for the emigration foreign currency. And I did not know anybody there so I went in and | said...there was a guard, an armed guard, and he asked, "What do you want?" And I told him, "I want to see Mr. So-and-So." I think I asked him to give me a name, but I'm not sure. I don't think so. I don't think I knew any names and we went into this</p><p> , this elevator which went up all the time anymore and to some floor and I went out and I looked at the sign and I didn't know to look for a certain name and somebody with an impressive title, but went in with two of his favorshein (ph) and told him we had been sent from Vienna in regards to the emigration of Jews. It was very important and he listened to me very attentively and said, "It is very interesting, but I have nothing to do with it. See Mr. So- and-So." So I went to Mr. So-and-So and told him, "Mr. So-and-So, there was already somebody.</p><p>They sent me to you. We are sent from Vienna and we are sent by the authorities in Vienna, not by the Betar (ph)." And he listened and said, "I have nothing to do with it." But, I said, "Who has to do with it, with the foreign currency?" Oh, he sent me to the right man and I repeated it for a third time the story and he was impressed. Everyone wanted to get rid of the Jews since I made it clear the situation had changed completely with of Austria and there is I say a memorandum too. And he said, "Let me have a memorandum." And I made the memorandum which I asked for Vienna and made a few adjustments I had it typed and it describes</p><p> buildings where and went back to them and give it to them on the first day it was and two days later, or three days later, I got the permission for 2,000 people, 12 pounds in foreign currency. We originally and we now started to tell the people, <span class="page-break" number="14"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 7 and one day shortly after apparently a neighbor had reported some suspicious looking men or Jews meeting there and the police came and raided us. And I showed them the permits from Berlin. This way Eichmann learned, Eichmann learned that I had the permission from Berlin and he shut up. He did not know more. And from this moment on, he played along very nicely.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So he wasn't angry at you, that you sort of went around his back.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He did not know. He did not know. I don't think he knew how I worked it. He just knew that the police had raided our office and that we had the permission from Berlin with currency even from Berlin. He didn't, the German proverb, "If you have a boot on your head you don't go into the sun; if you boot (ph) on your head, you don't go into the sun." He had been overruled. And he didn't want to see our trouble, I believe, so he went along with it.</p></p></dialogue>

I was arrested in the, I think it was for my axion (ph) my action (ph).</p><p> was arresting Jews by the hundreds, just by then somebody the name outside, dentists or what, they looked into the houses and somebody and they arrested them. And I thought when they arrested me it might have to do something with the transports and we had a meeting of the Betar, Erick Wolfe (ph), and I don't know who else from the Betar there and I was to but I should report to the police because the police had been at my office and said that I should come to the police about to question me. They wanted to ask me some questions. And the probability was that they just wanted to arrest me, but we decided since it is possible that news from Favorshein (ph). We were very nervous because Favorshein (ph) had stayed already a long time he was not known. If he was <span class="page-break" number="15"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 8 killed before cheating the government out of foreign currency.

And in the light of the jeep you saw these Russians, not the, the Russian horses, small horses, these wagons coming back. They went back with little wagons and pulled us into Russia.</p><p>They had taken this, and with them came the Russian Flea Circus, who had been brought by the Germans to Russia to work there. And this Flea Circus had robbed the Germans of everything they could. I didn't mind that. There was the women, they are sitting next to the driver of the horses, and there are dressed in fantastic ways. They had stolen or robbed the Germans, the drapes, and sewed these gowns and they were wrapped into this, green and red and blue, shiny. It was unbelievable.</p><p>And then it was again after we passed, it was pitch dark and we ran into a hole, there was a bump hole, and we came to a river where you couldn't cross, and so on.

This was about all he was. And he called the headquarters of intelligence, I assume, and said what had happened.</p><p>Because earlier we were afraid of political complications with the Russians. And so he says, "You proceed now to Batch-schwiber (ph), this is of course the military intelligence headquarters for Germany, and report there to so-and-so. And I took Laura (ph) into the jeep and instead of going to , she was quite sick, she was, looked like a skeleton. And brought her to a hospital in , Lisbon. Which disappointed her, and continued to Batch-schwiber (ph) and there I was seen by the General, who said, "What is this, it is horrible what you did, Perl." I said, "Yes I know. But you have to know the story." I told him the story and then he says, "What should I do with you?" I says, "Sir, wait a moment. Sir, what would you have done in my place?" So he think for a second and he says, "Hell I would have done the same." And he said, "Is it all right with you if I transfer you to another unit and out of military intelligence because this is too much for intelligence. To another unit and take you off the promotion list?" There was a listing where I was to be promoted to First Lieutenant from Second Lieutenant. I said, "Fine." I was promoted three weeks later. So I was then offered this, and I was then transferred to war crimes. You see, most people ridicule the army because they will send people in the wrong spot. I was always in the military in the right spot. I was in intelligence when it was really important to be in intelligence.</p><p>And when the war was over I was transferred to the war crimes, and I was from then on in war crimes until my discharge from the army in December, 1946.</p></p></dialogue>

And I was to go into villages that were there for intelligence and for information, the flyer has landed there, nothing was heard of him again, to find out what happened to him and who did what. And I did this, the flyers murders, in several places. In one place, something very odd and funny happened. I came there and I knew that the flyer had there and I asked what happened. He was killed. How was he killed? Beaten to death. No, he was shot, he was shot. I said, beaten to death but this flyer was shot. I said, who did it? So he said, so-and-so did it, he's a Polish worker. I said, now I want to, I have to talk to him because I assumed that the Germans did it. And they pushed this Polish worker in front, said he did it. So I had by then there and the crime was admitted at the , [had the name of the Polish worker. And the Polish worker, because it was shortly at the end of the war, was still there. And I said, bring him to me. And he came with a whole bunch of other Polish workers. And I asked him, you killed this young man? He said, I don't know their name but I'm thinking, but I had the right, I was entitled to kill him. I said, what gives you the right? And he showed me a, and he told me that he was very angry at this flyer, at the, wait a moment. No, he said a certain German had killed the flyer and he had killed the German, this worker. The German who was done, who had done it, was known but he was not here. I didn't believe them. They said that the Pollack who shot him is here. So I got this Pole, and he told me, yes I shot him.

And I read up about and the next time I came to him he was amazed how much I knew about , about his brother Michael and so on. Those were contacts, you know? Of course, he didn't notice that I am Jewish. So I told him, listen, how do you see your future? He said, I don't know but I think that we still win the war. I said, do you really believe this? He said, yes. I said, I tell you, I take you to the city and you can see for yourself, what was the , what they did to London, because thought that London was half destroyed. And I spoke already with your commanding officer and he said, take him. He says, it's your business. You take him to the city. So I took him to the city, I took first his word of honor as an officer, I knew he would never break it, that he wouldn't try to escape. I gave him a paper to have in case he tries to escape, I didn't take a pistol along. And he went, , said, you tell the driver where you want to go. So he told the driver that he just wanted to go to Piccalilli Circus and , well known places where there was hardly any destruction. I said, here, listen, there's hardly any destruction here. You stop and ask one of the passers-by where is the destruction and there I will bring you. And then you compare this to what's happened in Germany. So then he stopped and he asked not the first, only the second person who came by. Where is the best destruction? He said, I think it was some Poles if I'm not mistaken, near some Poles. I said, have the driver drive to some Poles and there we saw some destruction, a total of about five blocks, a few entirely destroyed. But no comparison to what they did in this.

And somebody had saw this, oh it was a program and the Americans have plenty of it and they sent plenty of it to Britain and the Britains didn't like it because it smells of garlic and the garlic in it, so it was not rationed. So I said, on the way back we are going to pass by there, stop me, I want to buy some snack. And we stopped there. We went in and I said, I want this salami. And this I got and he said, no ? Isaid, no. He said, you know they tell us that everything is rationed and almost everything was rationed. This thing is too.
