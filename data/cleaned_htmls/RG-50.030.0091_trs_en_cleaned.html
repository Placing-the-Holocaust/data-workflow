<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Let's begin our interview with my asking you to tell us your name.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Sure. My name is Hans Heimann. I was born in Vienna, Austria, on May 28th, 1920. My father's name was Sigmund (ph) and he was born in a small town called Westbrem (ph) in Hungary and he came to Vienna with his uh parents, his uh brother and sister and stayed there from then on, from...in the late 19 uh 19th century. And uh my mother was born, was a local-born girl (laughter). She was in Vienna. Her maiden name was Weiss, and uh she eventually married my dad and uh my dad had uh millinery export company, you know, but he traveled to Paris once, twice a year I should say, to uh buy uh materials and uh look at the great fashion houses which were...at that time Paris was the fashion center of Europe, not to speak...United States, it wasn't that involved at that time and uh brought models back and uh mother...my parents" firm uh built that up and uh they made model hats, was in German called . And uh was uh from then on uh <span class="page-break" number="0"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Eventually we got it.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Was completely uh free and nobody asked about uh Jewishness or...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When did you first realize that there was a difference?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not...uh to be perfectly honest with you uh there was...yes. They knew that uh...we all knew that there was anti*Semitism and uh that uh...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did you know it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We learned it, because uh...I was never called a Jew boy or something, no...but I learned it. There there is anti-Semitism. I learned it for...through the press and and uh reading the newspapers and magazines what was going on in Germany. Of course, until 1938 uh nothing was uh going on that was that bad. The only thing that was uh we knew that the Jews were not liked and they were considered inferior, but until the Germans uh marched in into Austria, nothing uh...we...I was protected so much, let's say, by my parents, etc.</p><p>and from uh that I...from anti-Semitism or from knowing too much about it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you said that you were protected up until the time the Germans marched in.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But protected in in what way you mean protected.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In what way were you protected as you recall?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, uh my parents shielded my from uh reading uh newspapers or__ about anything that was persecution of Jews in this field. They also shielded me from uh other events uh which were...for example, I recall that uh a famous actor was arrested for homosexual uh advances made to a young boy and uh my parents hid the papers from me. At that time we didn't know uh the word gay. They only gay we knew is uh gay Vienna or gay Paris.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How could you, or how do you remember the changes that occurred in your life?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The changes that occurred in my life came abruptly. Uh in uh...Hitler was making big speeches about annexing Austria that was under the Chancellor and uh he uh said <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> buildup of the industry. And then at the end he said OK, let's see who wins. Next Sun...next Sunday we'll make a , and uh to find out what the Austrians really <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: As you think back...think back to Kristallnacht, can you tell us a little about your memory of that experience.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, uh we were all shocked. We knew what happened and through the press and the radio...there was no television of course...we heard uh that the Jews were out to uh take over the world and uh etc. and then a decree came out from Berlin that uh all the Jews had to turn in their gold, silver and uh all their precious stones, etc. as uh punishment to for what uh happened to the German uh Embassy in Paris, and uh that uh liquidator, Mr.</p><p>Marscheck...we called him Helm (ph) Marscheck...he called me...he asked me to call him only by his first name, Victor...and he came over to my parents and he said uh to my dad, you're going to Paris to buy more materials and I tell you what. I'm going with you, not because I'm afraid that you won't come back, but I'm taking all your gold watch, your gold watch, all your wife's...that meaning my mother's jewelry, her diamond ring, her...she had a re...a string of real pearls...with uh and he took it to Paris and he left it with my uncle and it was safe at the time. Also of course my...what I mentioned before, my bar mitzvah uh watch, and when uh...then in 1939 by mistake came a letter to me, to my house, addressed to Hans Heimann. It said you are now eighteen years old and you have to report for military...you'll be inducted in the army, which was a mistake of course because they didn't know I was Jewish, and the German army wouldn't accept Jews, so the next day my uh parents called uh my father's distant cousin, second or third cousins, in uh Hungary and I flew out the next day and stayed with them till uh August of uh 1939, for two months, till I joined my parents in Venice.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Let's uh go back over this period. How did your parents determine to leave?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But they knew...by that time the business was liquidated and uh because there was no future. They knew war would eventually come and as a matter of fact it came uh three weeks later was uh September Ist 1939 when the Germans uh annexed the Polish corridor in ___ which is not quite to Dansk (ph).</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What made them choose the destination that they did?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The destination uh of uh Venice...because the Italian government was the only government in the world, not only in Europe, that didn't require a visa for people who wanted to immigrate and we had uh...we had the full intention to go to uh either Holland where my mother had uh customers, or to Australia and we got stuck uh with uh the outbreak of World War III, which uh started when Chamberlain and , declared <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> A No, no. We traveled uh...from Venice we traveled after a few days to uh Genoa, Italy, because uh from there we figured it's a harbor and it would be easy to uh take a ship to uh Australia. We could...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What did you find when you got to Genoa?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Genoa? Nothing. We uh rented a furnished apartment. We had a little money and we uh lived there undisturbed. Uh although we were Jewish we had uh German passports with that famous J I mentioned before and we lived there till uh uh 1940, and in 1940 one day there was a knock on the door of our apartment and two uh plain clothed policemen came and said uh we are from police headquarters, from the , which is the Italian word for the police station, in uh Genoa and we are sorry but uh you have to be interned. Why?</p><p>They said because you are Jewish. Alright. Said but don't worry about it. We are not animals. We are not Germans. And they gave us uh forty-eight hours to report to the police station. They said to my father, you and your son come to the police station at uh five o'clock or whatever time it was in the afternoon and told my mother you'll be interned in a camp and they told my mother here is your...here are your papers. You'll travel to Portenza (ph). It's a small town in the Mountains between uh Bari and the Adriatic and Naples on the on the other side, on the Mediterranean side, and my mother traveled there. She got a what the Italians called a folio de ville (ph), which is a travel uh papers. She traveled there unaccompanied. She was told to report to the police station in Portenza and stayed from there on. My father and I went to the police uh station and from there we were taxied, mind you, taxied to the train station. There was a train waiting for us of uh six or eight uh railroad wagons and uh they said we'll take but four of you into each compartment. European trains have compartments. They are not open uh coaches like the United States had, like Amtrack for example. And two policemen, uh uniformed policemen, which is the Italian uh state police, fellow police I should say, traveled with us and as we were all from uh Austria or Germany, we talked German to one another and the policemen uh finally said uh this is ridiculous. We don't understand you. Why don't we take a compartment for ourselves and leave you there. And while they were still traveling with us they took their guns out of their holsters and put it in the luggage compartment. They bought us from uh the vendors at the station in Genoa little baskets of uh food and drink and we traveled there. We traveled to a place called Compania (ph), a small town in the mountains in the...as much...in the province of Salerno (ph) which uh where eventually uh General Mark Clark landed in 1943. And we were there uh we slept in two uh uh monasteries that were converted for us. There were about two to four in a room. And we had free run of the town. It was a village actually.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So internment for you had a special meaning?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> AE Had a special meaning. Yes. We had uh what what's called a _ It's a gathering <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> We overlooked from a terrace the ocean. We went uh swimming in the ocean uh weather permitting. We got uh one policeman from the village was staying with us...the only one in the hotel and uh we had to just to be there at night, but we had free run of the town. We uh got uh permission to uh go to the movies if we wanted to. We received pocket money and we received also our money that we pooled for to have a kitchen and some...uh one ofthe were cooks and uh we were served three meals a day.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you have any work to do?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I wasn't...we were not allowed to work, no. But one interesting thing is uh that the policeman who was watching us, supposed to be watching us, the...so that nobody would run away and nobody could anyway because uh we didn't know...we didn't have any enough money to buy a railway ticket or to go anywhere, uh told us to..-uh said your tensions are high and the...you are all alone uh man to man. He said why don't you go to uh some ladies of the evening (laughter) so to speak. Those houses were government uh tolerated and uh inspect...the ladies quote, unquote, were inspected uh twice a week for our health, which is another slap in the face for Hitler's uh racial laws. Then uh after a few months my dad got sick. He...while we were still in Vienna, he had kidney trouble and uh he...a doctor came from the village, looked at him at that uh camp or the internment hotel and said uh you better go to the uh next town, to the provincial capital which was and uh get admitted to the hospital, all checked out. He was transported there by uh ambulance, government paid and I traveled with him. While he was in the hospital I was told to...I couldn't stay in the hospital with him but I could, should stay in a nearby hotel and the government, the Italian government paid for the hotel for me to stay there. Unfortunately uh it turned out to be cancerous and uh he died on October 26th, 1940. He was uh buried at government expense in the local cemetery. The grave still stands with the stone that was again paid by uh the government and it said in Ger...they asked me if if I wanted the inscription on the stone in German or Italian and I said I think he would have preferred it in German, and uh they set the stone and it said uh Sigmund Heimann, born 19 uh 1880, died uh 1940, at the age of 60. My mother of course was still in Portenza and uh there was no long distance phone uh at the time and anyway the people where she lived, where she had a furnished room didn't have any phone, so I couldn't call her. I sent a telegram and uh the telegram said uh Papa , Means means <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> town. We we were separated from the people in the camps, but some elderly men uh stayed with their wives and uh most of the single...not most...a few I should say of the single women had uh affairs with uh Italian uh men, again mostly married because in Italy it's uh nothing to have a mistress. It's uh considered uh obligatory (laughter)...they said let's not talk about it but we know what's going on. And uh which was in strict contrast to the racial laws of uh Germany and a doctor friend of mine, uh a Doctor Klineman (ph) was called one day to the police station where we had to report only once a day at eleven o'clock to sign the register. What we did the rest of the day or the night, nobody cared. And uh the chief of police, Vacero (ph) and uh his assistant uh <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> in English, but uh not perhaps not as much as I am now after living here for forty years, but I was so tongue-tied and so nervous that I couldn't...I got stuttered...I couldn't even bring out one word out of my mouth, and they eventually told me uh to relax and I spoke to them, and this was uh British 8th Army under General Mark Clark who landed in Salerno and uh uh marched up uh the peninsula toward Rome. Rome wasn't liberated till uh 1944. And at that time uh I went back to Portenza, that big...big town where we came from, big town, that town where we came from and uh we uh...I sought uh employment and the Allies are a military government which was at that time it was called AMGOT, Allied Military Government of Occupied Territories and was later changed to the Allied Control Commission. I worked for them as an interpreter and we traveled all around the province. Uh I was with a doctor, uh a public health official, a British ar..army major whose name...] think it was Beardsley (ph). Uh I'm not sure. Uh I'm not...I thought the name escaped me, but his name was Beardsley. And uh we traveled around and looked uh for uh people who needed help. And uh that was it until the ___ went further and further and we went into Rome. I went into Rome with him.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: As you traveled around and looked for people that needed help, did you come across any other Jewish...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, we did. Very few. Very few. The big shock for me came only after 1945 when uh the Allied Control Commission eventually was uh disbanded in Italy and uh was uh I went to work for the American Joint Distribution Committee.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was the shock?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The big shock was uh when we saw people coming from the camps, from the infamous death camps...Auschwitz, Dachau, uh Bergen-Belsen, uh Buchenwald, or what have you.</p><p>And how those people looked. Under-nourished, frightened, tattooed. Here as you know dressed in only in rags and that was uh...but I was appointed by the uh American Joint Distribution Committee to travel on my own through all the south from uh Rome south to Sicily to look for Jewish refugees and we found...we found quite a few who were hidden and uh they didn't know that the war was over. They were in uh bad...badly under- nourished. They had no money. I had to give them money and uh tell them to...resettle them, have them resettle in displaced person camps.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><p> organized ships that were paid for by the American Joint Distribution Committee and we put some of the refugees on these ships and went to outside the port of Haifa and where they were picked up by small boats and smuggled into the country. Of course that all ended in May of "48 when Israel became independent. After that uh the independence of Israel, our work there was not uh necessary anymore.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Why do you think that happened?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Why do I think that happened? Because uh out of the goodness and the kindness of the Italian people and also because they knew it was a lost cause, and they wanted to be on the winning side. They uh told us I hope uh when the British come and when the American, when the Americani (ph) are coming, uh that uh you'll always remember us and tell them of our friendship uh towards you and uh that we never tried to do you any harm.</p></p></dialogue>
