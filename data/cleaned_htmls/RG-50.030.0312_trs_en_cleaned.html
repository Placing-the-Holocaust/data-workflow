And what was your birth name?</p><p> A. Marianne, but my second birth name was Robczek (ph.).</p><p> Q. Tell me a little bit about your family life like in Vienna?</p><p> A. My family life was beautiful, just beautiful. I had very good parents. I had a sister. My father was a well-to-do businessman in Vienna. And I had the most beautiful childhood and youth life that ever you can image. And I was very young when I met my husband.</p><p>And when I was 19 years old, we got married in 1930 in Vienna. We are 65 years.</p><p> Q. Was your family religious?</p><p> A. No. No. We were Jews, good Jews. But not religious.</p><p> Q. Did you mix with Christian people?</p><p> A. A lot. A lot. We were together in school. My best friends were Christian. Customers in my father's business were Christians. It made no difference. As a matter of fact, I never met any antisemismus (ph.) in Vienna; I met only antisemismus in Poland. I never met any in Vienna to my time. I left Vienna in 1930. You know, that was a long time before the Hitler anschlus (ph.).</p><p> Q. What else can you tell me about your background in Vienna?</p><p> A. My background in Vienna was a good, simple life with a nice family. I went to school. I went to -- I have only 2 years of college. I didn't want to study.

My husband was a musician, a violinist, a very fine violinist, and we travelled a lot. As long as we were young, we travelled a lot. We went to Romania, to Hungary, and to Poland. And then we settled. When my son was born in 1935, we settled in Warsaw. My son was born in Warsaw, and there we settled, and there we were until the war broke out. In 1939 the war broke out and caught us in Poland.</p><p> Q. Now, when you were in Warsaw, were you aware of what was starting to happen in Germany?</p><p> A. No. No. No. We didn't -- maybe because we where young, and we didn't take life so very serious, you know. But rather I would say, rather it was a surprise for us. But it should come to us. All right. We heard a lot of things, what's happened to the Jews in Germany, you know, but we really never thought that was going to happen to us.</p><p> Q. So you were aware that there were problems in Germany?</p><p> A. Oh, yes. Oh, yes.</p><p> Q. Did you experience any anti-Semitism in Warsaw at that time?</p><p> A. Yes, I did.</p><p> Q.

There was a sign on the street -- [have to translate it into English. It was in Polish there. The saying was, "don't buy anything by Jews. Jews are you enemies." And there were signs on doors like barber shops. Jews -- not allowed. Things like this are very, very, very sad -- very sad. This time you felt very, very uncomfortable.</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And before the ghetto was closed completely, we run away from the ghetto -- from Warsaw, and we went to Krakow.</p><p>Krakow -- only Krakow we couldn't stay either. We had to move 30 kilometers away from Krakow, in the country. And we were living there. And then the ghetto was built in Krakow. When the ghetto was built in Krakow, we had to move back from the country to the ghetto to Krakow.</p><p> Q. What -- how did things come about that you had to move to the country?</p><p> A. Because we didn't want to be closed in in the ghetto in Warsaw. We didn't want to stay in the ghetto -- do you know you had to stay in the ghetto even if you didn't want to. We know what some of the things that might happen. We had to react to the sign of David.</p><p>And we took this off, and we traveled in the train like -- not Jews.

Now, it's a new year, remember. But then when they said that the ghetto was going to be closed, we left.
