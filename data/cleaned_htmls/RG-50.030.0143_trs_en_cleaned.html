<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Would you tell us your full name and your date of birth?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My name is Joseph B. Maier M-A-I-E-R. I was born on January 24, 1911. I was raised and schooled in Latski, Germany. What else would you like to know?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: A little bit about your family in Germany and what happened to you in 1933?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Now, my family -- that's an interesting question, had left already. My father left as a matter of fact in the mid 20s. He was an orthodox rabbi, had a lot of wanderlust, landed in the United States. My mother followed shortly thereafter with my youngest brother. In 1930, let me see, three brothers and two sisters followed them, joined them in New York.</p><p>I remained behind because I wanted to finish my gymnasium schooling in</p><p> . But one year later, in 1931, I was in New York on a student visiting Visa, <span class="page-break" number="0"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> and Guthers, in March something else -- the so called enabling act was passed which I don't know whether you know what the enabling act means, it made Hitler practically the dictator of Germany enabling him that is to say an his cabinet to pass legislation which would practically lead to the destruction of the Wiemer republic to the rearmament of Germany, to the ending of the freedom of speech and freedom of assembly and April, March came the -- if | remember correctly came the book burnings at the University of Berlin. On April 1, was the boycott anti-Jewish boycott which led to the looting of the stores and the beating and arrests of the owner of the stores and transferring them either to concentration camps or the Gestapo prisons if not to their early deaths. These were things that were happening by the time I returned to the university. By July, when the semester had come to an end I woke up and I wrote back to my parents who had been of course concemed since Hitler's assent to power. This time, right know, I'm anxious to join you in New York. I've had enough. I'm in fear of my life. Please help me and send me the affidavit and the boat ticket. I want to leave as soon as possible. By September the Nazification had progressed further and I knew that Hitler had in the meantime had succeeded in abolishing all parties except his own. That the rearmament of the Nazis in the violation of the Versailles Treaty and the deception by wealth and stealth was going to proceed without any inhibitions by domestic certainly not domestic or from the outside. On September, in deed, 1933, in September 1933 I left and eventually landed in New York and joined my family.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can you tell me then what the professional route was that brought you from there, and we'll try to do it fairly briefly that brought you then to the role that you have in interrogation and intelligence. I know it's a big jump.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I'll tell you very quickly what it is. From 1933, September 1933 when I landed here, from practically 1939 I was a student at Columbia University where I earned my masters and ph.d degrees, while also working as a research associate at the Institute of Social Research with all the principals of the so called Frankfort School of Sociology, Social Science, including Max &gt;&gt; Herbert</p><p> F , Henry Grossman, Franz Nuemen, and a number of other people, but the principals were actually, the principal figures were and Fran. Fran not so much <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> was by at the time the only American citizen and responsible for all the English language pages and columns as well as for the Jewish political and religious and learned subjects.</p><p>From 1944 to 1943 I was propaganda analyst for the United States Office of War Information in New York. From D-Day until after VJ Day I was propaganda analyst for the Office of War Information, American Embassy in London, England, but more especially attached with a small group of American officers to the hush-hush BBC monitoring service located at near Reading with a special duty of <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Between say the later part of "42 and this period where you're looking toward the end.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>What was your sense of the news that was coming about, say the messengers about the exterminating policy. People like Yankarsky (ph) who came to England and to Washington. Were you aware of that kind of news or by the time you were with the Office of War Information in London, what was the atmosphere of knowledge about the policy.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I tell you, as I recollect now, I first didn't want to believe it all. I didn't want to believe -- I knew that the Nazis were our mortal enemy, but I could not for the life of me believe that they would descend to the depths of bestiality and barbarity to which they actually did. I didn't want to believe the first report. I couldn't. I said I've lived with these people. I hate them. I want to bring them down to their knees. I want to destroy the whole damn Nazi structure. I want to punish every one of the killers involved, every one of them, and I felt that I had a strong mission to do just that. For all that, I couldn't believe about any reports that there were by that time, about what was involved in the &gt;&gt;what had taken place in the conference. I couldn't bring myself to do that. As a matter of fact Aurandt and I both formulated against in our respective columns in</p><p> . There is such a thing as a project going on in Germany, and there are by now several books about what German writers abroad, that is outside of Germany were writing about Germany at that time. And somebody writing a dissertation about discovered that Joe Maier, that is myself and Hanna Aurandt were among those people, but especially Joe Maier as a responsible editorial person in</p><p> for writing fairly about the Germans. Writing fairly about the new <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> whole lot of difference in my feelings, but I never, even thereafter, waiver as I said before, in what my duty was. I wasn't going to emulate them. I wasn't going to exact retribution for retribution. I was interested in building, not in bringing down the rest of the world. Not in poisoning the rest of the world for all times to come, but for building a better world. During that period, that is during the period of our invasion of Europe and the beginning of our victory in Europe, I received a letter from my brother, who was in the CBI theater, China Burma India theater, and had learned from my wife who kept everybody in the family informed and sent them excerpts of Joe's letters, my letters that he thoroughly approved of what I wanted to do in Germany, go back and help in the rebuilding and lay the foundation for a just and lasting peace. He would like to be a part of it. He thought we were real people with vision and courage to do that sort of thing and he hoped that Alice, my wife, would be a party with us to do that sort of thing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So when did you set foot back in Germany and what did you find?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I have to tell you first what happened when I got back to America first after VJ day. I insisted to my superiors that I had to touch base at home before I accepted any job assignments in occupied Germany. I'm absolutely willing and determined to accept such jobs, but I have to touch base. I have to see my wife. I have to see my little daughter.</p><p>That I must do first of all. Make sure that they are alive and well. A few weeks after I came back home to a great hello and all the embraces that I dearly needed, I was in the employ of the war department as it was then called still. As a matter of fact, I had to and was invited to show up for an interview at the pentagon in Washington by a Colonel Dustair who was interviewing the right kind of people to function as simultaneous interpreters at the forthcoming Nuremberg trials. I thought I was the man for the job. As I think I told you before, I speak several languages, but I dream I curse and I pray in only two, German and English absolutely perfectly. There isn't a word that I can miss and not a nuance I would miss. I thought I was the man for the job and Colonel Dustair, a good guy, he thought that was right. I was the man for the job and he hired me on the spot.</p><p>Shortly thereafter, I was in uniform and back on German soil in Nuremberg amidst a heap of rubble. In one damaged hotel to be our hotel I think it was called Adlog where all the American personnel -- not American personnel, the American Chief of Council personnel were located. Eventually, I was assigned another building. It was a heap of rubble. Nuremberg had been completely destroyed. Only a few buildings and in the surroundings suitable for ourselves were left standing. It was a depressing sight <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> I was absolutely certain and which he agree on I was, then I didn't want the job at all.</p><p>Then I wanted to be assigned to the analysis section of the interrogation division, which I was eventually. Much to Colonel Dustair's reluctance but to my own satisfaction I was much happier and much more appreciated in the analysis section of the Interrogation Division of which I eventually became the chief. Now, you wanted to know when I finally got to interrogate Herz and to the document I turned over to :</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: If you would explain a little bit about your nature of the task as an interrogator?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yes, gladly. As a member of the analysis section of the interrogation division I now actually had a chance to both analysis the materials that were disclosed in the course of the interrogations by any of the officers. I got the verbatim transcripts of --that is copies of the transcripts of the interrogations but also to participate in the interrogation and interpretation job myself. My main job though, and I liked that of course. That was up my alley really, and this is how I finally got to interrogate Rudolph Herz the culprit whose confession I gave to the museum myself. But I was not a principle interrogator not even of Herz. I attended a good many of the interrogations. As a matter of fact, I attended most of the interrogations conducted by my colleague Alfred Boothe. All in German. Some of the copies of the transcript you have in the museum collection which I turned over to you. All of these interrogations by Alfred Boothe were attended to only by the young lady stenographer, Alfred Boothe and sometimes myself, sometimes. It was during one of the -- all in German. We didn't have anybody else present, and most of these interrogations were concerned a) with the confirmations earlier of which he made earlier, to all sundry, including my boss's my immediate superiors in the Interrogation Division, that is the chief of the Interrogation Division, Colonel Ahmen, and my immediate superior Colonel Burkhardt. Substantively and substantially the confession he had made several times in earlier interrogations, but all the interrogations that were conducted by Alfred Boothe and myself were conducted in German only with nobody else present but the two of us and mostly Boothe himself. And they were concerned almost exclusively only occasionally with the repetition of the confession making sure he was still testifying under oath, but mostly concerned as I said with his, that is Herz's relations and conversations with the poison gas industrialists with whom he was dealing in the extermination of our people in the chambers at Auschwitz. It was during one of these latter interrogations that it suddenly occurred to me that I hadn't seen in isolation the straightforward in one sentence confession I Rudoloph Herz during my term of office as concentration camp commandant of Auschwitz put so and so many Jews or had so many Jews put to death by gassing so and so by other means which I then had signed and sworn to before me. That was the only occasion that I extracted an without <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> interrogation of Herz, I felt positively ill. I had to go to the bathroom and vomit, and that happened more than once. That didn't cease, but I wouldn't let on. I showed the same straight forward face. I wouldn't let the enemy see my face that I was moved that I conducted myself other than a straight American officer.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can you describe him, what kind of impression he made on you personally?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I tell you, that is not to believe. To me personally, who had dreamed of this kind of a job, that I would have to do it. Ii would force myself to do it, that I would face the deviling carnage. I had to discover that the devil doesn't look like a devil. The devil looks like a little man, which he portrayed himself as to a miserable creature who once he's rid of his power and glory and the whole aura that surrounds such people in power. Once they're bereft of the uniform, once they're bereft of their familiar environment, they are absolutely mediocre, familiar kind of little man, about the little, little man who portrays himself about a good father, a good family man, a good husband, who does nothing but his duty and he things of nothing but his duty. And even when he had horrible things, admittedly he had horrible things to do, difficult tasks, he called them, difficult tasks to do. He didn't enjoy them. It once occurred to me and Senator Jewry who did most of the interrogation of Herz and we had written all these articles together Senator Jewry and I which were published in the --oh I did have to tell you that separately, which were published in Jewish Journal, the New York Post, a whole lot of articles. If you're interested I'll tell you about it. They insisted on they were mere executive organs.</p><p>Nothing ever was done on their own initiative. Executive organs of the Fuhrer. That's sheer executors of the categorical imperative of their superiors. Their superior being in the last instance the Fuhrer himself. Everyone of them as a matter of fact, including the military with the one sole exception. On occasion, Goering himself would admit he had actually signed the order and he felt he was responsible for order whatever the order was.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Wasn't Goering skeptical about how they could have killed so many people at such a rate at Auschwitz?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh, he was skeptical, he had no idea about what was going on, the detail he denied knowing about. They all denied knowing the details. As a matter of fact, it turned out that the various concentration camp commandants and those responsible for this variously either exaggerated, probably exaggerated and exaggerated the numbers that occurred in one concentration camp compared to another. But Herz prided himself in conferences other concentration commandants of being able to accommodate and being anxious what he called , accommodating more of his victims than any of the others, <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, he made a factual statement which he had wrote a factual statement which in fact he testified to earlier several times. There was no emotion. It was what he called a hard duty.</p><p>He took no pleasure from it. He derived no pleasure. I said didn't you have fun doing that? I wanted to test him and see whether he was a sadist. He was no sadist. He was perfectly normal. He was doing his duty. I really believe he was doing his duty. He was doing his duty. He considered that his duty, and he shut his eyes to the abnormality of this kind of thing. To the incredible abyss to which human beings can descend in order to perform duties of that sort to which performance I think a normal person would revolt, rather than dying himself than do it himself. I always I figured I would rather commit suicide. I'd die fighting against the Nazis than do anything at their behalf. The slightest favor. I have to tell you something else. I have to tell you also that I was among those who were furious about those who helped among the Jews in the camps and outside the camps who did the listing and who did the helping and who did all the helper services, the so called kapos for the Nazis. I was absolutely furious. I said how can you do this to your own families, to your own men and women. Old men, young children and women, I said helpless as they are. I was absolutely furious and I couldn't believe -- I didn't want to believe at first that Nazis would be able to do it, but this man did it and thought it was his odd duty. He did it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did he explain it, the duty?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Never in any other terms. Never in any other terms that this was a hard task. That he was told about that it would cost him a great deal of psychological energy and strength, but he had to do it for Germany and he had to do it for the Fuhrer, and there was nothing, I was finally convinced that he would not do, that he would not do for the Fuhrer. Absolutely nothing, but what he did do was more than anybody could imagine anybody able to do.</p><p>He insisted he was a small cog of a huge machine. He had nothing to do with initiating, nothing he did on his own. He did not permit himself to feel any pity in the face of the hard duty to perform, which would elevate and guarantee the rise to last for a thousand years. Unspeakable glory, unheard of glory would come to the rise and to those who had helped to defeat international Jewry and international capitalism and international bureaucracy, and of course enemies of the rise, who are all in the service of the Jews.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did he talk about the responsible of others, Eichman?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, he only to those from whom he received his direct orders, and the chief of the office the head office in Berlin was was one of the <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't recall. You could be right about this. I don't recall. I concentrated mainly on Auschwitz. To me that was the most heinous places, the most dreadful of places. The one place that I wish would never exist and would disappear and only leave the memory. The memory must be preserved. The memory must never die. The memory must never die, otherwise I don't care much about Auschwitz, but the memory must not die of what happened there. That's why it may be necessary to mark the place on the spot, too, this is where it actually happened.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You were in a room with him and only two other people, that's a fairly intimate situation?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What kind of exchanges happened?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: As I said, we had orders to conduct ourselves as American officers. I considered that a sacred duty I might say, too. I always stayed. I never fell out of line. At the interrogation of one , where I was the interpreter as well as the interrogator, there was short interruption in the interrogation and I shouted at who was the immediate superior of Herz's . Lreally shouted and I roared and <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 0</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yes, oh yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can you tell us about that. He was quite proud of his set up wasn't he?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, he was -- let me say this. We tried the interrogators, the interrogators in the interrogation division, mostly my colleague Senator Joury tried to squeeze him as much as possible and especially then afterwards in the intimacy of the just the twosome or threesome with Alfred Boothe, who were the individuals, what's their names of the gas industrialists, when did you advise them of their task. Did they ever ask what you needed the gas for? They didn't especially ask me but they must have known they admitted they must have known for what purposes was because it was in the vicinity and anybody knew about this and everybody knew what it was being used for. The industrialists themselves who denied involvement could never been shown to have been actually been asked that they were told by the concentration camp commandants that they were used for the gassing the culprits but it was clear on the face of it that they knew about it. They must have known about it because everybody else did know about it, and the chimney smokes and everybody knew what the fires were about. What the smoke was from. This was no child's play going on. This was no fire festival of any sorts. No fireworks, everybody knew what the smoke signaled.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Are there some other defendants at the trial who made a big impression on you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I must say the whole lot of them with one exception made the same impression on me, a very said and drab impression. The one exception because he had an extraordinary 1.Q.</p><p>was , the former president. He had a very good i.Q. yes, but you know what the strange thing is, he wanted to be interrogated as he was eventually by a Colonel who eventually became a U.S. District Court Justice. He was up on economics and he wanted to be interrogated on his economic brilliance and specialties and all that sort and insisted on having an interrogator to whom he could really disclose what his contribution was to both the building up and the undermining boring from within of the Nazi government until he was booted out. The only man with a superior 1.Q.</p><p>who impressed me as such sat there in the dark of the open military tribune asked by a mistake on our part, he was associated with the wrong kind of club. He said as if the whole thing didn't concern him, just this motley crew over there, rightly so, rightly so, but I associated with them. He was acquitted eventually. I saw him on the streets subsequently to. I didn't want to talk to him. I didn't want to give him the satisfaction that he got off without punishment because he had also helped them. He was early,-- he belonged to the early conservatives who joined with , aristocrats, the Nazi government, you know. He was among those who persuaded Hintenberg too that everything was going to be fine until he found out better and had to be put on ice himself.</p><p>But he was put on trial for helping the big shots into their saddle. It was the right and just thing to do. Compared with the job of course performed by the others, his was minor, a minor crime compared. It was a big crime. I wouldn't have let him go scot free, but compared to the crimes committed by the others, he impressed me by his intelligence and by the nerve he actually had and a sense of humor too and dissociated himself publicly by gesture and position and posture from the rest of the crew. But the rest of them as I said, sad and drab mediocrities. Sad and drab. Physically unattractive, no disgusting, especially , who insisted on talking to us in English most of the time, <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 2 impress a Russian. He was scared to death of any Russian and every Russian that entered the room, the interrogation room. And that, let me tell you, was true of the whole lot of them. The whole motley crew. I had no respect for any one of them, and I couldn't in as much as I tried to show even a spark of sympathy for any of them, I couldn't. And I'm not a harsh man myself. I can sympathize. I can empathize, but what I saw there imagine me empathizing with a disgusting creature like Striezer. It was impossible. The way he appeared he struck me as belonging to an inferior animal kingdom like rats and vermin more than anything else. I had a physical disgust actually towards most of them. I would have hated to be touched by them. I didn't shake hands with anyone. There was one exception among all the people that I interrogated myself and that was :</p><p> SS general, young, university educated, gangster, but handsome,</p><p> intelligent charming courteous differential, respectful, especially of a fellow academic, which he recognized in me immediately. He almost succeeded in deceiving me. You know I'm the kind of person who was brought up to regard Latin and Greek, if not Hebrew as the proper guise, the proper garment of the truth. I thought anybody brought up in what I called , in the humanist spirit could be nothing other <span class="page-break" number="11"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 3</p><p> day one, which was very early at the beginning of the war the SS, and that he had become one of the favorites of Himler himself and that he ended up as a general in charge of intelligence of office four in charge of security and intelligence of the</p><p> Security Head Office. I also found out eventually that he was the guy who was supposed to kidnap in Spain the Duke and the Duchess of Windsor. That he was I found that among the documents too, and charged with about it and</p><p> said make no mistakes and he checked things with as well as with Hitler directly. And that he had succeeded even during the so called</p><p> period, you know right at the beginning before the invasion of the Netherlands and the Scandinavian countries. He had made contacts in the Netherlands at the German Dutch border with two British intelligence officers posing himself as an anti- Nazi among the military, anxious to come to terms with people trying to make peace on the British side. He succeeded in kidnapping two of these officers while misleading them and bringing them to Germany. They were kept there until after the war. I found out about this I would have loved to interrogate him about that about his involvement with that. I never got a chance to do that at all. But among the more interesting I think for our purposes, for me and trying to help Israel and the zionist course, was my interrogation of</p><p> . Adolph Eishman's immediate subordinate. He was one of our witnesses in Nuremberg too, in my charge. I had occasion to do that without any court reporter, without any interpreter present, at the request of my superior officer, Colonel Burkhard, or was it Colonel Ahmen, I forgot which it was, to interrogate this together with Gideon Wolfer, at the time, in British uniform, British officer.</p><p>Subsequently it turned out to be among the first labor party representative of Israel at the United Nations. Together with him, I interrogated the and alone without anybody else in German only about the whereabouts of <span class="page-break" number="12"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 4 they didn't like the Jews there either. They have a long history of not likening them. That to me, was a profound shock that there were people among those who suffered under the Nazis who had even were grateful at the same time, if not grateful, but showed sympathy to the Nazis for one task, the kind of destructive work in which they were engaged against the whole world. That was a profound shock, and a severe lesson. There are enemies in our own ranks and we have to guard against them, and be mindful of them.</p><p>There are also allies.

That is, she was ten years my senior, she wasn't that old, at least in years. My little cousin is a full professor now at the University of Colorado Political Science, and expert in French politics and German politics. He could testify to you what happened right there in Studthoff, where he was with my aunt, one of the other concentration camps. There happened to be also a relative of my wife's who I eventually got out of, when she landed in Frankfurt, I happened to be there and I got her to join her sister, whom we had previously given an affidavit. She managed to escape to the United States before American's entry into the world. I managed to get her here too.</p><p>She died too, she lost her husband in the concentration camp.</p></p></dialogue>

As she said from the very first day and offered to return it. I said I'm not going to take any money. You honestly and rightfully bought it and my mother-in-law will not claim it, but it's nice to be here and I had to sleep in my mother-in-law and father-in-law's house and eventually when I brought my wife two years later or three years later when I came on a research grant, I was already a professor by that time, I lived in -- we were welcomed in that house -- and we slept where Oma and Opa used to sleep, that is where my mother-in-law and father-in-law slept. That was the place which was reserved for us whenever we came. It looks a little difference now, but from day one, I learned from the when I was there the first time, I said I want the cemetery to be brought in order. I'm going to come back and I want that cemetery, whoever is around here make sure the cemetery is brought in order. I want every stone to be put where it was. I don't want it to be made smaller by an inch. I want a fence built around it. I said I want to recognize it because I'm going to be there and my wife is going to be there too. We want to see that this what we call , that is the burial places of our fathers and mothers are kept in tact. They testified for our presence for hundreds of years. I wanted that to be brought in order. I said I'm going to hold personally responsible for anybody who disturbs or fails to do his duty in that regard. I'm going to tear out everything and I can do that when I get furious about it. So, they were sufficiently intimated but they needed, because I was talking mainly to my friends who were at my disposal and took me there took great care to take me to the cemetery to see what needs to be done, what has to be done and who has to be in charge. For years thereafter, I followed up on that. And every time that we went as we did in the last couple of years until only recently when serious illness befell both Alice and me, my wife and me, we used to go over there pretty regularly. to the cemeteries to look after things were properly done. <span class="page-break" number="15"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 7 completely destroyed city.

There'll be jobs available at the American universities and your job will be there I think. My wife had the right instinct all along. I followed that instinct. I always trusted her instinct. li was given to patterns. Once I made up my mind I had a theory and believed firmly in the theory, but patterns and theories are worth less than the sound . They have a better instinctive sense of judging the character and feeling out an opportunity or sensing an opportunity and knowing people better. She was a much better judge of character among the university where she after all spent a lot of time through, than I was. I was a student mostly interested in ideas and in patterns as I said. Finding fool proof devices, something like this. She trusted sound instinct. I thought I had better follow her advice and returned home. I was a bit unhappy because I had less power than I had when I was in Germany where thing were done at my beck and call where I could travel and had my travel order card as long as I was in the army and in uniform. I could go most anywhere in Europe. I traveled very often to Britain because I had become as I told you make good friends there during war time and I felt that that was in a sense coming home. Anytime I had a deferment I went to Britain or I went to Austria or I never traveled that much in Germany. I got to know more about Germany than I ever known as a youngster. I stayed put in . I was afraid to move to where we eventually had to move. I would have stayed on the spot where I spent my childhood because I was attached to that. I hated to go places.

We had to establish and give teeth to for the first time international law. Henceforth, we have to set an example first and for all times to come to set an example that such crimes will be punished by one authority or another.
