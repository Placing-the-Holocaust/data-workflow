<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Please tell me where you were born and when.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was born in the city of Iasi on January 30th, 1923.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I'd like you tell me a few words about your childhood and to tell me something about your family when you were a child.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My parents...my father was a guitar player, used to play in different restaurants. As a child I had to learn how to play the violin because I had to help my family, and my mother, my mother wasn't working and we only lived from what my dad used to bring home, so I also used to accompany my dad in restaurants and play so we could support our family. When I was a little older, I left...I didn't play with my dad any longer and I started playing with another younger chap and we played in restaurants to make a living. And I played the violin.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Where did you learn how to play violin and where did you go through school?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In Iasi.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you have any problems with children in the neighborhood or did you get along with them?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Around my house, everybody were our people. We used to play together and we were friends. We did really not have many problems as a child. No, not at that time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mr. Moise, tell me a little bit about what happened with you and with your family when the war started? What did the war mean for you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: The beginning of the war...first of all, I could no longer make a living. All the restaurants closed down and I had no place where I could play. I had to work to find different jobs, jobs which I didn't really know how to do. For instance, to work in a all kinds of <span class="page-break" number="0"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I got married in the beginning of February 1942, after my parents died. My dad died in 1941. My mother died right afterwards in January "42, a year later. I was left alone with my sister and I had to go make a living. I didn't know what to do with my little sister. I used to leave her with the neighbors but still when I took her home, she told me that they had beaten her up, they didn't feed her even if I did pay for her keep and they kept her for a night or several nights, I used to pay them to keep her until I returned from my work.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How old was the little girl?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: She was six years old. Maybe five, six. And she used to complain about it...they're beating me up, they didn't feed me, they scream at me. And the neighbors told me that since I was eighteen years old, look for a girl, get married, so your wife would take care of your and you should care for your sister. There's no other solution. For sure you will not be able to get by yourself because your brothers are gone but you have no relatives to help you. Nobody will help you, so get married and then your wife will take care of you and of your sister. So in the beginning of February I found some really nice people who are the parents of my wife.</p><p>Somebody took me there and we agreed and we got married and indeed when I came home, at that time we didn't have radiators. It was a private home. We used to heat it with wood. I used to put the lights on, and I used to come home and find food on the stove, a little heat. My sister was taken care of. Somebody was there to take care of my sister.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What happened afterwards?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So later I used to go to the city to play. I used to make a living because I had a home where I lived with my wife and my sister.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Just keep talking about it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Shall I tell you directly about the war?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes...what happened.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In September February, March, April, May, June, July...we had a quiet life in my own home. I had no problems. On September 15th at one o'clock in the morning, the police came to our house and they told me to get dressed. They asked me what's your name. Moise. This is my wife. This one is my sister. Alright...get dressed and pack up your luggage. I didn't even have time to consult with anyone. Nobody could explain to us what was going on, why they were taking me away, so whatever I could find around I put in a blanket, wrapped up their blanket, took it on my back and they took us at a commissary headquarter and there there were other people and they took us to this school, this school out on in the town of P <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> was a school or a former synagogue...I don't remember. So anyway, all night long until in the morning, they kept bringing in people from Iasi, gypsies. At a certain point they used to call our name and take us to the cell and they used to take information...ask us information about our address, the parents, where I was born...so anyway they filled up all kinds of forms. There were many many people. And we stayed there maybe about two days, until they finished the forms for all the people. After everything was done, they formed small groups and they took us to the train station in . There there were trains waiting for us, freight cars, empty. They were freight cars, yes. We had to climb into the cars. We were too many of us in a car. At least we were very crowded which found our little place and we stayed in these freight cars maybe another day, one night, in the train station until they brought other trains from other parts of the country, also a train full of gypsies. They attached those newly arrived cars to ours and the trains left.</p><p>Whenever train stops we were allowed to get out just for our basic needs. They would occasionally open the doors. We could get off, just for a little time and we kept going until we crossed the River , but it took a while. Then we crossed the River and even then they would open the door at times so we could go out. Maybe they gave us some water too...and then we crossed the River and we arrived. Whenever the train would stop, we arrived at the place where we could see Odessa (ph), not close by but far away, at least different uh suburbs of Odessa. On the left, so that the car was on the right on a secondary rail. In front of us were some military people, some soldiers. The soldiers were not doing anything. They did not have any kind of military exercises. They just stayed there doing nothing and there were some ditches near them, and the soldiers, they...we stayed in our cars and we stayed there from morning...I don't know exactly what time, but we stayed there until evening, maybe three, four, five in the afternoon. The soldiers did not leave. They received food. We saw that because there was a</p><p> right in front. They just stayed without doing anything. As soon as the mechanic engineer of the train gave the signal for the train to leave, we boarded the train again and we saw that the soldiers left as well.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Who used to guard the train?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The soldiers. They were soldiers, dressed in khaki uniforms.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What happened later?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We went through Odessa. I don't remember all the names of the train stations. After Odessa we were closed into the cars. We couldn't see any names. When we arrived at ; there we all had...many of us had to get out of the train and we had to march in a column to the small train, the train that would go, not . Probably it continued to . It was nota <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I would like to ask you something. Tell me how were the conditions during the march?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Very, very hard.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell me a little bit about it. Was it a long column?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, very long. There were military guards, Romanian guards.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was it police or gendarmes?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They were gendarmes or military people. They were dressed in costumes (ph). There were many, many people. Sometimes you'd rest and there were many who would come from behind, from the back of the column. How shall I say...they would rush to come so they could rest for a longer time because those who were at the beginning, at the head of the column, would rest a little longer. The ones in the back, until they arrive to sit down, then we had to start all over again, so all these people from the back would come to sit with us. They told us there was a cart with a rifle behind us, so we guarded on the right, on the left by these sentinels but there was an armed cart behind us, and we arrived at Petrosky, so...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Excuse me all the time interrupting you, but on this road, you are thirsty, you are hungry...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Don't even mention that. We were just about bursting. It was September which is very hot. The sun was burning. We would go by wells, by running water, brooks, rivers...we were not allowed to stop to drink. We were not allowed to drink anything. Not even a drop of water till we arrived in and no food. No. No food. We arrived in Petrosky and there when we <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They singled out somebody to represent each city, a group of the city, a delegate who would represent Iasi or another town. They would go this town nearby and they would bring the flour back and he divided it. We had a box, a tin box like...but the flour was not really processed.</p><p>It was rough. So he said that each person would get about two hundred grams, which was a full cup of that tin, two hundred grams per person. A family that had five people, who'd get five cans ____ and you couldn't really protest. You couldn't do much with this flour and occasionally you'd get two or three potatoes too. Excuse me. A cup of porridge and potatoes, and that's how we survived, until it being fall, there were fields...they had harvested the fields but on the field were left some cobs of corn, a few kernels of wheat, and we'd go and pick them up, but we were afraid because if they caught you, nobody...we were afraid. We would come back. So very few of us dared to go. So they'd rather die with the family than go out to pick up these leftovers.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Why wouldn't they come back from the fields, if they'd go pick them up?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: There were these delegates I would call them who were going on these horse-pulled buggies. They were armed. They would patrol and if they found you on the fields, they would shoot you, or they would take you and you'd never come back.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were they Romanians or Ukrainians?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They were not Romanians. They were not Romanians, no.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And they were in civilian or uniform?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, civilian. And meanwhile as we stayed in the fields, we were very upset, hungry, full of diseases. Three men arrived, three young men, and they gathered us there and told us that they came from Bucharest. They came to send you back to the country. We came as a delegation...we have an authority. We received an order from Bucharest to send you back to Romania, but if you want to go back to Romania, the country does not have any money so you must pay your own expenses back from Transnistria to whatever your home is. Can you imagine that. Anybody gives the shirts off their back or anything just to go back. We didn't have much but whatever we had, we put together and gave it to these young guys. They had some marks with them. Whoever had marks or golden earrings from women, wedding bands or maybe nice blankets or whatever special or valuable we had, we gave to these young men. They took everything and made a list, and they said wait, that the official delegate and we will come back. We'll go to pay for the transportation. We'll come back to pick you up, and you will leave. You will go back home, each of you to your own home. You can imagine how happy we were. We waited and waited and waited and never saw them again. Not to today. They saw everything. They saw how many we were, just about there, and they took the last penny we had. They took the last hope which you just sold for a piece of bread or a potato. There was we sold anything for, but anyway...we stayed at this farm with our two hundred grams of this flour and nothing else...nothing, nothing else, and occasionally we got these two potatoes per person, and we stayed there until November.</p><p>In late November, other people came and took us to . <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We found out later they emptied this , a village. There were some very good homes built of stone, good roof, good fences, very good quality homes but empty. There was no food in there, no fire, nothing. When the people evacuated, they took everything with them, so they took us there. There were homes with two rooms, with three rooms and they packed us in these rooms. They were so full that you couldn't even move around. All you had room is to stretch out to sleep and a little path to go out to the hall. There were somany ofus ___. And this representative, this delegate who was old and probably he knew more about these things, started to give us this flour again, two grams per head and we stayed there, hoping to be repatriated to Bucharest so we stayed there till maybe until February, March, 1943. And again somebody came to say the order came from Bucharest that you go back to Iasi, that the trains were waiting at , at . They are waiting for us. Again it's cold weather. Everybody let's go. We hardly had anything else with us. Everything that we had we sold for potatoes, for bread. We had really nothing, so during the night they took us and we started again marching about two days to return to the station in . There, you can imagine what happened on these two days on the road. It was cold. The children were naked, without shoes, without food. In the train station, the guards surrounded us. Where are you going? Why did you come back? Well, we heard this and this. No. Nothing is true. Go back. There were old people who said well, if we have to go back, we'll just die on the roads. It's cold. We are hungry. Then they thought about sending us to _In we...these people arrived at the station of the gendarmes and somebody, probably the mayor...I don't know who...then said why did you run away from : You had homes there, and you ran away, because we don't have a place to put you up. All the people who leave here from Romania who are here, we don't know where to put you up. Go back...or we don't know what to do with you. One of the people I remember of the places was a barn which was just being built, was still in construction. It was being ,no windows, just the outer walls, no doors, no roof, just ground on the floor, bare ground, and that's where they took us. But this would be our home. We have no other place to put you in. We were even happy with that. At least we were protected from . They showed us, somebody from the village, are going to find some straws. We put them in the window places and in the door places and on the roof to protect ourselves, so we built this protection. And each of us took a little place on the ground. We already knew how to do this, and we stayed there also with this two hundred gram of flour. It was not...probably was a practice everywhere, even in the larger villages. That is what they distributed probably everywhere, because . We would <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> die too , So my wife told me like this...g0, run away, run, even if you don't succeed, you'll <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> knows. Down with you. I took my violin. He took his guitar. We got off the train when the train stopped at the next station to , something like this. I just have this sounded the name of the town in my ear...and we went quickly to a passenger car. There were women who were going to the market to Odessa and they had all kinds of goods to sell there. They knew who we were and they hid us in near behind their baskets and we stayed there until Odessa. In the train station in Odessa, we got off. We looked left. We looked right. Nobody was there. Just a soldier, a guard at the door. Near that station, there is like a zoo or something, maybe a garden, a park. It had an iron fence in front and a little gate and near the gate was this guard. We saw the guy, had I think a mark or some money, gave it to the guard in his hands, and we entered into this park. There were several sculptures there, some statues. I don't know who they were. We...anyway, some statues. And we kind of hid behind those. There were some bushes and we just hid there and my fellow said, you stay here and I'll go in the station. Let's see where we can go. Maybe I can find a Romanian railroad worker from Iasi because Romanian trains would arrive to Odessa. Maybe I'll find a Romanian. Let's see what we can do. If we managed to get all the way here, maybe we can get away from here, because in Odessa if they saw you in the station, they would arrest you, we know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What happened?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The week before, one guy ran away. Also a guy from __ who was a violinist, a young man without any family. He was by himself or who knows...maybe his family was someplace else, but he was alone. He ran away to Odessa. Maybe he knew that somebody in where he was from...I told you that...from the town of or and so maybe a long <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> and I went to the market, to the bazaar and I bought some shoes. I bought a shirt. I went to a bath, a public bath. I went to a barber. I still remember today what the barber said, that he found some bugs in my head. Of course who could have washed himself for weeks __, sol remember today how I was in the barber's seat. The barber must have told to his colleague...parasite...parasite. I realized that he must have found a bug in my hair, but anyway he didn't kick me out. He cut my hair. I went to the bath. I took a bath. I shaved and by now I had my ___. [hada place to sleep but I didn't have any peace in my soul because I knew where I left my wife and my sister. I used to cry all the time. The girls who worked in the hotel saw me cry all the time, but I didn't tell anybody where I came from, only the people who were around me. One evening...so here, here in the...we played Romanian folk music at this hotel. Many people who came to eat, they were Romanians who were coming back from the front, pilots, officers. And I still play Romanian songs. When they heard the pilots, when they heard Romanian music, the Transnistria government department . There were Romanians there too in that area. They were working for the government, young men who would come in the evening and take me to their restaurant after I'd played, and I'd go with them. They would take an accordion player, a guitarist, and we would go with them and play for them a little longer, and they'd bring us back. But in my soul I was not happy. I know I had food. I had a bed, but I wasn't peaceful. One evening, there was a big banquet, a dinner, and who gave it? A colonel, a Romanian one with his family. He was there, and hearing that there's Romanian folk music at this restaurant, he...that's where he decided to have the dinner. We played. I didn't drink. I was a young man, but who knows what I did that evening. They fed us too. I had two or three glasses of wine. I started crying. And I had this boldness that I said I just can't continue on like this. I have everything I need here...food, drink, money, whatever money, but canI do anything | this evening. Can I do anything tonight. If not, I'll go back to my wife. I saved all the money. I kept it all with me. I didn't smoke. I didn't drink. I would only maybe buy a little something. I wanted to save the money and to keep my promise. So I went to the colonel. I said mister, I'm from Iasi. And he thought that we had been hired by the owner directly from Romania, that we had our papers. I went to him and said, Colonel, do you want to help me. Yeah. Tell me. I'll help you. lam . My family is in...what's the name of the place...not in a camp but where I just left them, before . Anyway, I have my sister and my wife there. I promise that I'll bring your wife here. And I held to this promise, but afterwards of three days, I almost thought that they would arrest me, and escort me out. I saw the colonel was not coming back and I realized that I was in problem. Meanwhile, two invalids from the war from Iasi came there. They had tried to go by train to Iasi, Odessa...I don't know why they came, but they could travel by train. They heard that's Romanian folk music. They were curious to hear. They came to the restaurant. One was from my neighborhood, from Iasi. was his name, an invalid from the war. When he saw me, hey , do you want to go home. I can take you home. I said <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0 staying here...my wife...maybe they'll die here. I'm going to go back. He was afraid, this other fellow, that somebody's going to hear us and arrest both of us. I was decided to go back by now.</p><p>Anyway the train came. We boarded the train. We took the instruments, the violin and the guitar, to the passenger cars. It was maybe a rapid or a fast train, and in the area between the trains there was some room for the guitar, for the violin. We didn't have a ticket so we kind of hid there so we wouldn't get caught, and we went till we got almost at .</p></p></dialogue>

The guy who was checking the tickets and a gendarme, a military man...I don't know what ___ he was. He was in a military uniform. He was not an officer but a lower...maybe a major. Ah, he says...I've been watching you. I've been looking for you. From Odessa I've been trying to find you in the train and finally found you. We got arrested, both of us. And between these passenger cars...before those doors some cars especially for prisoners that they were transports. There were thieves and other criminals, and they were transporting in a special car. They took us to put us in that car. My companion was older. He had already done his military service. He told me, , get your money out and let's give it to them. So, Mr. Radu (ph), I was left with nothing. Everything I took out...I don't know my companion had anything left, but I tell you, I was so afraid. Everything that I had saved to save my family, I gave to this soldier and we put it in the pockets of the soldier.</p><p>He didn't say anything.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So let's go back to the...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: In I played in a restaurant, so in the meanwhile I had heard that my wife was home but she will tell you how they came back also because they didn't have any papers. They ran away too. Meanwhile I sent a letter to Iasi. When the letter arrived there, probably somebody read it and went to the police and said so and so didn't run away back to where he had to but he is in___, and one evening as I was playing in a restaurant, three policemen or maybe two...it was maybe about eight, eight thirty in the evening...came all armed with the guns in their hands and told me to lay down my violin, during the program, while I was playing, and to stay still, not to put my hands in the pockets, to...and he was ready to handcuff me and my companion. You can imagine that having been there for a while, some people knew me in the restaurant. The patrons knew me and they thought that maybe I was a thief, so I told the policeman why do you not handcuff me. I'm an honest man. If you want to arrest me, arrest me, but without handcuffing me. I can declare in front of you that if I'm going to try to escape or do anything against the law, you can shoot me. They agreed. They took me to the police headquarters. They locked me up, me and my companion. Somebody from Iasi had been sent there to arrest me, these people from the police in Iasi had sent to arrest me for having run away from Transnistria. It was already the end of "43. I arrived at the police station. I stayed there. My mother-in-law hired a lawyer. They said he's not a thief. He never stole anything. He didn't do anything. in a police. See if he's not guilty, why detain him just because he's a gypsy, because he's a little dark. Is that why you keep him? He didn't do anything. Maybe it's good for the country or what? Why are you taking him to his death? So many young people died in vain without doing anything wrong. So then probably the others were coming from the east, so they let me go. I came home but I was still not very much in peace because I was afraid anytime I'd say anything to anyone, they would again have me arrested by the police, because they said I was not Romanian. My place was in jail. "44 arrived. In 1944, the same...I was playing in restaurants and that's how I made a living. In March again I was arrested. No...they took me as kind of a military service. They took all the young people in Iasi and around Iasi and they marched us again. Again I left my wife and again they took me and we went somewhere in Moldavia.

When we got off the freight cars, we arrived in a train station. We could see in front of us other gypsies. Maybe they had arrived the day before or more. They were sleeping there. We thought that maybe there were some people...we didn't know if they were alive. There were so many of us piled on each other. This was in a train stationin __. We got off the train too. The others who were there already were woken up. They left us there a little longer. I remember that one of us didn't have time to get all his luggage from the cart because the train started already. We got off fast and they got up the other ones who had probably arrived the day before us. They formed a column and we started marching on foot, so we walked from the morning...I don't remember the exact time but I can't...we marched all day, all night as I told you till about two or three in the morning, so whoever could walk, walked. Those who were like old, it was sheer torture for them to walk. They had to be carried on the back and they were dragging the young people not to leave them behind, or see if they were left behind. Anyway, it was torture and we walked like this, so I told you till about two thirty... can't remember the exact time but about two thirty. They allowed us to rest after we marched the whole day and we marched all day, evening and night, till three in the morning the day before, so with very few stops.

Why were you brought here? Let me while you are here? But just because you are a gypsy, to be tortured like that. With the torture, hunger, cold, misery...for what? For me to know that I suffer for something, if I did something I'd understand, but I didn't do anything. Why should I be tortured for that, and what a torture, because probably I know...they don't know that I didn't...1 wasn't put in jail. I think in jail was better. At least the jail would have a roof over their head. Here, nothing. Through rain, through the snowstorm, wind, rats...like rats you had to go into holes to take cover. You thought why? Why? Why should I have to hide in a hole when I didn't do anything. I can work. | like to work. I'm good here for doing other things in life, not to hide in holes under ground.
