<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No question about it because of the writings, the Hebrew letters, and that's what we were breaking up. The interesting thing it was, it was very cold.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It was winter, but you were saying that you left in May to go to Auschwitz May of "44.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: By the time we got to Riga.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you were in Auschwitz then a longer time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Not necessarily because after Auschwitz we didn't get straight wait just a moment.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And these were labor camps?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Labor camps, yes. They were labor camps. Now, here it's a very interesting thing. I got the job. I had a very good friend who actually who was actually in the underground in Germany as <span class="page-break" number="34"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 38 well I mean in Austria as well as in Hungary. And we have decided since somehow or other our first cousins scattered or were assigned different kind of camps. We going to stay like sisters.</p><p>So she took up my maiden name. Suzy Jakab or Yakab. I had a first cousin, Suzanna, that I was seeing from first grade on together. She was not there anymore. She was assigned to some other job. So anyway she became Suzy Jakab. And was represented a sister of mine and we really stayed together to the very end. Now the interesting thing it was, that for me to work outdoors, shoveling things, it's very difficult, I'm not physically strong. She was very strong physically so she took over the heavy job. And the job she got that was a sort of like a railroad inside the big barn looking thing that they were transporting items from one to the other. She taught me how to use that particular machinery. It was something like a railroad. And you had a little, like a little choo choo train to drive it. I drove it several times against the wall. That they didn't kill me for it I don't know, but anyway I did it. But what did she teach me to do, I never did in my life to sabotage the inside, what is inside. Two of us sometimes went in there breaking things and then receiving the box __+ like it would have arrived, you know, it arrived broken.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did you break them?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: What do you mean how did you break them? If you smash a carton which has light bulbs in it, how does it break, okay, or if you puncture plastic bottles with some kind of chemicals, what happens to it, all right? We took really big chances. We could have been hung for it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Why do you think you were so brave?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I don't know, because she encouraged me. And I think that somehow or other I felt that it's coming to them. I mean they did, I mean they kill us without even I mean, we are not human beings with them. They exterminating us. So what, so we do a bit of damage, too. I mean really it was my step sister so called that we cooperated, and somehow we got away with it. <span class="page-break" number="35"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 39</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Was this in Stuffhof that you are talking about?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was either Stuffhof or Stoll or maybe both places. And that was before we even ever got on the road to Riga.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did anybody ever find out that you did this?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I don't know if anybody found out who did it, but that somebody did it. That's for sure.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, we could have been hung for it easily or shot for it easily without any whatever. But somehow it was a revenge.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you tell anybody else you were doing this?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, only between the two of us. It was our secret. I don't know. I mean it's unbelievable.</p><p>For instance for many, many years, many, many people ask, you know, did you tell your children? I said why should I darken their young ears with horror stories such as this? And I never did. It was very difficult for me to even think about these things, nevertheless to talk to my own kids or to my grandchildren. Sometimes my son asked about interesting stories. I said I might have interesting stories, but it's not for the ears of children. Those are horror stories.</p><p>Those are ghost stories. And I don't want to frighten them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What were the living conditions like in Stutthof?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Not too bad. Not too bad. We had those bunk beds, which I hate to this day. I wouldn't have a bunk bed in my house or nothing. And all of my grandchildren do have bunk beds. And when I see them, I say, honey, how can you put lovely grandchildren stack over stack. I mean all right, it saves beds, because the bedrooms are not and especially if you have five kids, you do need the space, right? But just recently, my youngest, _ + youngest daughter, who's eight years old fell off the top of the bunk bed splitting her head. <span class="page-break" number="36"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 40</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: How long were you in Stuthoff?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It must have been at least a month or so or perhaps even longer at least.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did they give you more clothes?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not necessarily. You get used to it. It's very I was really working indoors. It makes a big difference. My so called stepsister took the heavy part of the job and when you work with the shovel and filling dirt or whatever, you know, you work physically hard, you do get warm.</p></p></dialogue>

We got a little bit of a report just passing by, but they were definitely on the other side. And we were on the other side so there wasn't, you know, just really straight contact.

It's such it's such an awful feeling that those people, Jewish people even in their grave, even that little respect is taken from them. It's an awful feeling.

There is just no two ways about it because those supervisors are standing over you and you have a certain assignment and you have to break up this much during your work day, and that's all there is to it.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But you were able to continue?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Apparently. I had lost one first cousin during that particular march, not her sister was next to her.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Apparently. I'm here. I don't even know how or why or when.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you know approximately how long the march took?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It must have been at least a week or more, at least. All I know is that somehow towards the end we wound up in the Saar region dancing, and that's where I was liberated by the Russian soldiers.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Let's talk about that. Let's talk about liberation unless there's anything else about the march that you remember?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, not really, not really. Only thing I know of that a number of people fell out and never made it.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Along the roads? <span class="page-break" number="46"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 50</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Along the roads, you know those zigzag things.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The trenches?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, the trenches, that the Germans themselves used. My stepsister, Suzy, Suzy Jakab or Jakabs, Suzy Jakab. She got shrapnel through her eye.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was this on the march?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, that happened already when we arrived to the Saar region. We were dancing in one of those bunkers, all right? The place where we arrived was heavily bunked by the Germans. And they asked for five volunteer women to peel potatoes. And that was asked by German soldiers.</p><p>And we decided what did we have to lose, at least we eat for a few days because whatever rations they gave, if you peel potatoes, we get the benefit ourselves. So we went potato peeling, five of us. That was myself and my stepsister and three other women. And after about a week of this treat, because really it was a treat because we ate, the soldiers said now you have to return to your camp. And we thought surely the moment we going to turn our back, they are going to shoot us, but they didn't. They walked thataway and we walked thataway. And after a few minutes we looked back, we didn't see the German soldiers, we saw the bunker flocked down in there. So there was a bombing. The Germans were bombing that Saar region. And my sister or stepsister got a shrapnel through her through her leg.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Eye?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was next to her like even closer than I am to you right now. I didn't have a scratch. But anyway I ripped up something. I don't know whatever she wore or I wore to make a tourniquet, all right? And then after about after about 24 hours the German Russian soldier said that the war is over and handed the first cigarette I'd ever seen in my life. It was a hand rolled, hand rolled and hand cut tobacco. So anyway I never smoked. And I handed it to my stepsister who <span class="page-break" number="47"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 51 was actually in the underground, and she was a smoker already from the age of 16 or whatever, not that it helped her because she wasn't paid. We didn't have anything. So after about a day or so ambulance came and took all five of us to a hospital. But three of the women were pretty good looking, hefty looking were raped in front of my eyes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The other three women?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The other three, not me. I was like a walking skeleton and, of course, my stepsister was injured with the tourniquet and the loss of blood so she was got away.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Who raped the other three women, the Russians?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Um?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Who raped the women, the Russian soldiers?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The Russian soldiers.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you afraid it was going to happen to you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Ina way, yes. But then again, I looked at myself, and I said who would want this walking skeleton even to touch. I mean I was just really skin and bones even though I was still young.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Had you been getting your period during the war?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I didn't for a whole year. I didn't for a whole year. I was convinced that there is something in the food which suppresses all that all that feminine action. I mean it's part of life.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Umhum.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But the doctor convinced me that's not the case.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection -</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was hoping it's true. And then I heard also horrible thing, which I heard. There were very few people sort of half dead, half dead wandering around that camp. It's called Mashata (ph). It just occurred to me. Mashata (ph) _+.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you didn't quite believe it when you first when the Russian soldiers said the war is over?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not really, however, the Germans did something horrible. There were few sort of half dead wandering around. It looked like that the whole camp was either _+ or diseased or, you know, just ready to be buried. The few alive people who were still alive transported on a boat and the boat was blown up so they all went down. They all went down. That's awful that the Germans did that. Now, that's something which they they didn't gain by killing another 50 people or another 25 people, but they did it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: After liberation, you were with your sister?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So actually what you want me to tell you, what do you want me to tell you?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: She was in the hospital, and it just so happened that the farmer's daughter died in the same room where my stepsister was, Suzy. Okay? And I went to that farmer. I said I will be glad to work for them if they let me visit my sister at least once a day or at least three times a week so I see how she's getting along. So I was so I was with Polish farmer. They didn't even know I'm Jewish. And I never advertised it because I didn't know. I didn't trust them.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Allright? The number didn't make any difference because the political prisoners had numbers also. And they were not that well educated. So anyway I went to see my sister, how she's coming along, and she was sometimes on very high fever. And we were very, very concerned, but she had a very strong constitution and she pulled through very good. And anyway I went and I was able to take a little meal again, a little cheese and a little sugar or whatever they gave me. God forbid that I should take it without asking. But I asked if I may take something for my sister. And I was scrubbing the toilet for them and I was tending the whatever __ or feeding these or whatever I was assigned to do. It didn't make any difference to me as long as I was able to provide a little help for my helper. And slowly but surely she got a little better, but I got very bad, and I was admitted to the hospital for a few weeks for better nourishment, and it was middle of or end of July that finally</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Who was running the hospital?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: The it must have been the</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: The Russians?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Russians, yes. It definitely was. The Saar region was definitely occupied by the Russians, yes. And then I was admitted to the hospital for a little better nourishment to build up my strength.

Can we <span class="page-break" number="55"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 59</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Ihave three great grandchildren. I think I told you. Can we? Yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can we now talk a little bit about your feelings and reflections about your experience? Has the war, your experience during the war, has it made you more Jewish? What is your feelings about being Jewish considering what you went through?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I'm very proud to be Jewish. But then again on the other hand, I'm very proud to be Jewish.</p><p>And I declare it especially here in the United States when they the people make completely uncalled for remarks, you know, jew you down or, you know, expressions such as that. So usually make the remark, the Jewish people usually are very fair and sincere, and they don't want to cheat people out of anything. As a matter of fact, you can rely on a Jewish person because holically (ph) or according to the law it's a sin to cheat. And anybody who's observant is going to respect that. There's another thing, which is very much observed that is in the ten commandments to respect and honor your elders. That's a very important thing in the Jewish law. That's one of the dos instead of do nots. And I think that the almighty was very kind to us.</p><p>That was when we reach a certain age that we need protection and we need his protection. I think it's wonderful.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You had said that you really didn't talk to your children or grandchildren very much</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: about your experiences. Did you ever share your experiences with others?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, hardly. It's difficult. It hurt to talk about it. It hurts to talk about it. Now, what would I say to a ten year old? And then he's going to look at the other young mothers, maybe they are younger than I am. I was 30 years old when George was born. And I was 37 when Teddi was born, when my daughter was born. I was 37. She was born in 1960. That is seven years difference between my children. It wasn't my choosing. It just happened so what can I tell a <span class="page-break" number="56"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 60 child about my experiences? And then he's going to look at his best friend that he comes over to play football with or hockey or just do homework together. And then he's going to say, what, your mom I mean this is something, you know, you read not even in history I don't think. They don't even have these things in history books or do they?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Does the war still affect you? Does your experiences and what you suffered still affect you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: For a long time I had been asking why me? Somehow I don't ask it anymore. I don't know why me. I mean really and truly so many so much better people perished. I feel, for instance, that I always envied my brother who's younger than me that he's such he's so much better person as a human being than 1am. Why not him and why me? Somehow or other I feel guilty about being alive and him not being alive or, for instance, the event that the war was over, and Hitler does not exist anymore so I heard that they committed suicide in their bunker with Eva Braun Brown, right? I asked dear God why did we deserve this? Why did you do this to us? What have we done? I mean I'm not speaking only about our group? It happened in Poland. It was really something. So I don't know. I mean I am asking a lot of questions, but I am asking less and less as the time goes by. I live to see a whole generation of new grandchildren that my two of my granddaughters are married. One of them already have three children. So I have great grandchildren. So maybe there is a purpose in all of these I mean I have three I have a big family again and I came home alone. Alone with my husband, the two of us. It's not alone anymore. But I didn't even know when I was liberated by the Russians that I do have a husband here that took several months to arrive to the particular to that particular moment.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you receive war reparations?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I never asked.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Why not? <span class="page-break" number="57"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> 61</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because I don't want their money. Money doesn't it doesn't mean that much to me. There is nothing they could they could pay me a million, but my mother and father will not rise from their grave. My parents will always be there, and my brother is nonexistent. I've never asked for reparation. I don't want their money. It's very funny. I'm going to have fantastic expenses, and I know that I don't even know if I'm going to survive this ordeal or not, but somehow I feel that I did not leave in vain. And the reparation would make much different. Maybe it would make a great deal of difference for the children. Maybe I should because of them. But for me money has no, no value in that particular thing. I have seen people selling houses, homes, fortunes, yachts for a crust of bread, really. I mean when it comes down to value, what is value? Life is valuable. How you live your life is valuable, but not money. The money is not doesn't somehow or other I am completely nonmaterialistic. Maybe, maybe it's foolish. And I should be a little bit have a little bit more foresight, and the children are going to be burdened with my expenses and whatever. But for myself, I don't want their money.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Is there anything you wanted to share about being Jewish with your children or grandchildren or great grandchildren?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, to be proud of it. Just to be proud of the fact that they are they have an inheritance, thousands of years old, and be proud of it. It makes me very proud to see my oldest son sit down with the two youngsters, the two ten year olds, Rosalee's son and his son are about the same age.</p><p>And he's learning with them half an hour every evening, so he's transferring his knowledge, his doctora with the young children and that's beautiful. To me, it gives a wonderful satisfaction.</p><p>That's value. To me, that's value. It's not the new outfits, and the new bicycles and pizza shops and God knows what, that's beside the point. But the inheritance, our history to be transferred to the children, to teach them how to put the feeling on. To go through bar mitzvah. To be <span class="page-break" number="58"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 62 prepared he prepares them for the bar mitzvah. He doesn't hire another tutor. It's a wonderful thing. To me that means a great deal and so did my younger son, not to mention my daughter.</p><p>They became so religious. He's teaching in a yeshiva, and she'sa__ now. And she's very, very respected in the Jewish community in Brooklyn. And, listen, being in Brooklyn you have to be very religious in order to fit in. And she is fitting in. As a matter of fact, she's a foster mother to aretired besides her own five children. I mean I'm very proud of my kids.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Wonderful. Anything you'd like to add before we finish?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I don't know. Ask me. Is there anything I need to add?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Just any other thoughts that you have?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Um?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Any other thoughts about what you went through in the war?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, the only thing is that there must be a purpose, only God knows what that I went through, and I'm here. It must be a purpose to it. It couldn't be just a coincidence because I think that in our in the whole world, nothing just happens just by coincidence. Why this happened to us? Why exactly that particular community, it was hit so very hard, only God knows. But I'm sure it's not only question of money. We did have some rich people who were able to buy fake papers or went to Switzerland or whatever. Still somehow even they getting a certain tradition with us with them. Don't you think? And they assured us or the survivor of certain amount of people. It's could be it was their own family. It could be somebody outside the family, but I think that it nevertheless saved a certain amount of people. So it was not in vain.</p></p></dialogue>
