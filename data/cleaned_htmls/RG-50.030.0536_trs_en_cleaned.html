<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Which was Rzeszow.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. Tell me a little bit about your family. Tell me about your relationship with your father and your mother. Do you remember? I mean, not when you were a baby, of course.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But I mean when you were a little bit older.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: When I was a little bit older, we used to spend -- spend summers with Grandpa in Rzeszoew, and I had another grandfather in Jaroslaw, who was the grandfather on my father's side, and the rest of the time -- time, we lived in Jaroslaw on the San river. And it was a normal, middle class Jewish household. Moderately observant, I would not say strictly observant. And my father had a lumberyard, and they also manufactured some bricks, and they built small houses with those bricks and with other building materials that were available. And that's the way -- and that's the way my childhood is remembered in my mind. The business that my father ran was very much like the business that my maternal grandfather ran. It was a middle of the road,  <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Maurice Friedberg deg August 12, 2009 not very large, not very small, but old enough and large enough to provide them with a livelihood, and that's the way I remember it, by September 1, 1939, which was the day when Nazi Germany attacked Poland. And my first wartime memory is --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Can -- can we -- can we go back a little bit?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Ju-Ju-Just bef-before -- before the war. Because your brother was born in 1932, is that correct?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That is correct, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was your relationship with your father like? Was it -- was it a close relationship before the war?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was -- it was a reasonably close relationship with my father and my mother.</p><p>And my mother was the stricter of the two, and my father was the one that you always would run for shelter and assistance when my mother was getting too tough.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And what ki -- how tough did she get? What -- wha-what did she do?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, she wou -- she would slap me on my behind, or she would take away some privilege, or -- or some special kind of dessert food. And this was, again, quite common in those days.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you ran to your father to get protection?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right.</p></p></dialogue>

He would tell her to take it easy, or it was really not so bad, you know, so what do you want from him, he's only a boy. Things of that kind.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And was this rather typical in that -- in households that you remember, that the mother was much stricter than the father?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, [remember it as being exactly that way.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh. And did you have meals with your parents?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Th-There were conversations, but nothing very exciting or very important, because after all, I was at the most, nine years old.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. And was this -- you s -- you said that your mother was somewhat religious, was the household very religious? Were you kosher?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, we were kosher, but being kosher did not consi -- it was not considered being strongly religious, this was the minimum religiosity that was expected.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you go to synagogue?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, we went to synagogue quite regularly with my father and grandfather, and I even remember where we sat in the synagogue.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: That's correct, it was predominantly Jewish.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 9 Interview with Maurice Friedberg August 12, 2009</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Uh-huh. And what sort of a home did you have? Did you have a house, or did you have an apartment, do you remember?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, we had an apartment, and I even saw that apartment after the war, when we visited Poland, and I remember the address, it was the Slovaski(ph) Street, house number 14 on the second floor.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm, so you were on one floor, the -- of a house, and someone else lived below you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, someone else lived beside us.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And when your brother was born, was this a difficult time for you, or were you happy to have him -- an-another sibling? Do you remember?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't remember.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You don't remember?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Do you remember if politics were discussed at all, so that by the time the Nazis attacked in 1939 that you were expecting this, did you hear things?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We heard things, we were expecting things. It was not unusual, and it was not at all uncommon for politics to be discussed at the table. So that when the Nazis attacked on September 1, 1939, it did not come as a surprise. And my first memory  <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Maurice Friedberg me August 12, 2009 of the war was a Nazi airplane flying very low, and somebody living in the same apartment building jumping out of the house with a small revolver, the kind of -- the kind that ladies would have in their bags, and he shot at that plane.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right. And it was to me a symbol of futility of resistance, because there wasn't a thing that this pla -- that this shooting could do to the plane.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So even at such a young age you thought that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Mm-hm. But i-in-- in 1939 in September, your father was already in the Polish army, is that correct? So his --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Right, he was in the Polish army -- he was in the Polish army because there was a call to arms, you know, asking all eligible males to present themselves at this, that and the other place. But as it turned out later on, they didn't even get to provide them with uniforms, let alone with arms, when the Polish army was crushed by the Nazis.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So where yo -- you went with your mother and your brother, an-and -- and was -- did you go with your grandparents to Tarnopol?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no, because they were in Rzeszew, and we were in Jaroslaw.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So one morning a couple of Nazi soldiers and local collaborators appeared in -- in our apartment and they gave us five minutes to get ready, and they deported us on  <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Maurice Friedberg " August 12, 2009 the other si -- to the other side of the San river, which was to become the Soviet zone of occupation, as distinct from the German zone of occupation, which they decided to make free of Jews.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you were deported, this wasn't -- this wasn't a decision that was made by your mother to -- to leave.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's correct, that's correct. And I remember we arrived at the bridge on the river, and I clearly remember an example of Nazi humor. There was a -- a roadside -- a roadside sign which says in German, nach Palistina, to Palestine. And we were just -- we were just pushed to the other side of the river, and then the Germans returned to their side of the river, and we were on the other side for a few days, and it was not clear what those few days will bring, and where we will end up. I remember we stopped in this small Jewish town, and my mother wanted a place where she could wash me and my kid brother. And it turned out that the only place where you could get washed was the local mikveh, the religious bathhouse where -- where women would immerse themselves after their periods, to make themselves again clean. And in that little town, it was a town with a single industry. The industry was making twittel(ph) -- making the phylacteries that observant Jews used for prayers on their hands, on their arms and on their forehead. And then a few days later we met my father, who was looking for us because the army, the Polish army disintegrated, and the -- there was absolutely nothing else for him to do. And there  <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> </p><p> Interview with Maurice Friedberg deg August 12, 2009 were people roaming around looking for deported relatives and friends. And that's how -- and that's how he found us.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did he know that you had gone to Tarnopol?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. But he figured it out because that was the only relative that we had on that side of Poland. And so he went to Tarnopol, and so did we, and that's where we met.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, you were not deported to Tarnopol, you were deported over the San river.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's correct.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And -- and then you had to figure out what to do.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I mean, your mother had to figure out what to do.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's right, right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And those few days that you spent pr-prior to going to Tarnopol, were they terrible? I mean were there -- were there a lot of people?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, there were a lot of people, but they were not terrible, because there were no shortages, and whoever lived in that area would try to share with us some food or whatever else was available.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, when you were sent over to the San river, that -- that -- you were walking, I gather.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: That's correct.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Maurice Friedberg 8 August 12, 2009</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did you have a little backpack -- not a backpack, but a knapsack with you or something?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, yes. So would have -- so you would have some laundry to change into.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And I think an extra pair of shoes or something like this.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right, but you couldn't carry anything very heavy, clearly, right?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no, of course not.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did your -- did your mother carry some food with her?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: A little, but not much. Again -- again, it was some bread and cheese.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. And, did you walk to Tarnopol then?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And were there -- you had relatives there, I gather.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My mother's sister lived in Tarnopol.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So that's where we went.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you went there and you stayed there in -- in their home?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We stayed in their home for several months until the deportation to Russia.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So it was just a few months?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Just a few months.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you get there in September, and you leave --  <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 4 Interview with Maurice Friedberg " August 12, 2009</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And we left next spring, when the -- the Russian authorities asked all the refugees who came from the other side, who expressed their preference, the preferences being to remain a Soviet citizen and stay at Tarnopol, or to go back to the places from which they were ejected by the Nazis, which is what we chose to do, because that's where most of the family was, in Rzeszew, and some even in Jaroslaw, because not all of us were deported of the same day.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see. So you wanted to go back.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We wanted to go back because we wanted to be together with the others.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right. But this was a ruse by the Russians --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: That's correct. And one night they appeared in my aunt's apartment, and they read our names and they said, you will have your wish carried out, and they took us to the railroad station, put us in cattle cars, and we were supposed to go to the other side of San river, but instead when the train began to move, it became obvious that we were moving in the direction of east, rather than west, and east was Russia.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. We -- let me go back a little bit. What -- what was it like for you on Tarnopol? Was this a difficult time for you, or was it okay?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was okay. It was not very difficult because there was no -- there was no strict rules about behavior or buying or selling food. So, you know, th-there were a few tules, which were not terribly strictly observed, until they put us in those cattle cars  <span class="page-break" number="11"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Maurice Friedberg (r) August 12, 2009 and begun to move in the direction opposite to the one that we expected to be moved to.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right, right. So it wasn't -- so -- so you -- did your father work during that period of time in Tarnopol?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: He did. Where did he work?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He -- he worked on behalf of the authorities examining state property to make sure that nothing would collapse, or burn down, or get stolen. But again, this was a very pro forma kind of arrangement, which was supposed to change into more perm- permanent one, until -- until we were sent to those cattle cars, and until the train began to move east.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And your brother was okay?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My brother was okay.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We lived as a family, plus a-an older brother of my mother's, who was deported with us because he was -- he was in with us together in Tarnopol at her sister's. So, my father went to work immediately to next day, and this uncle of mine, being a traditional Orthodox Jew, decided that he'Il first s-say his prayers. And as he was saying his prayers, the KGB or NKVD or secret police commander came in, took out a watch from his pocket, and said there is no way you will get to work on time.</p><p>So we are going to send you to a different camp. And they send him to a stricter camp -- camp, with a solitary, with common criminals.

And for entertainment I will go outside the barracks because a few people there were to dig a grave for me. And so they would try and do it on the warmer days. You know, they would start the fire, and then the soil that was under the fire was warm enough for digging. Well, they never got around to burying me. I managed somehow to escape death, but the result of the jaundice is something that -- that I had for years and years later, because the art -- the jaundice that was not cured, resulted in problems with my -- what is -- what is the -- wi-with-with ma -- problems with -- with my li-liver, and th-the other thing which -- gall bladder.

And since we were all freezing in those camps, the decision that was made immediately was that whatever it is, we shall try and escape Siberia, the Urals and go to a warmer climate. And I remember somebody got a map, and on this map we circled those towns where we wanted to go. And one of those towns was Jambol.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We heard rumors, but we were not sure whether the rumors are correct.

It was a Soviet institution that would exchange valuables that foreigners may have had, for things that you couldn't otherwise get, such as food, such as clothing. And so there was a flourishing black market of people trying to get those things that they could exchange later for food or black market. Did I make it clear?</p></p></dialogue>

And I remember he was starving, but so was his dog, and he didn't have anything to give to the dog, and the dog ultimately died of hunger. And we lived in an extra room that he had in his house, for a while.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right. And the Polish school was allowed to receive some support from [indecipherable] in the form of -- of grits or -- or some other thing that they could cook, and they could give you a portion of it for lunch. And in this respect it was better to be a student in the Polish school than in the state Russian school. The Russian school did not enjoy any special privileges and the Polish school did. And also the Polish school was about 90 percent Jewish. So, you know, you did not expect to be mistreated for being a Jew.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: How --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, I think that it was so because by then the propaganda of the anti-Soviet groups spread the word that the new pro-Soviet government is really a Jewish government.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And why do you think they did that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: To undermine that government.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. Yes, I did, because the police would occasionally close its eyes to the fact that the Jews had weapons, because they could not provide them with protection 24 hours a day. So they would say, if you have a gun, we will not kill you for it. You know, and -- and you could find guns all over the place.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, because the Polish government wanted the Jews out, because they were a se --a security drain, and also because they knew that the Jews will be an excuse for anti-Soviet, anti-communist activity.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. But it is interesting to know that in all of these situations, there is schools available for kids.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now did you know kids who were in school from previ -- from other places?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So is there more to do in Paris for you as a chi-- as a seven -- you're not a child any more really, but I mean, you're a teenager --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Mm-hm. Yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- you're 17 years old. Is there more to do, or is the situation so bad because of the ravages of war?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I think because of the first. But again, there was no clear line of demarcation between the two. And there were always rumors, you know, that within a week, they will allow Jews to leave for, say Venezuela. Which they did.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But they knew that people were lying?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They knew that people were lying, and -- and the train to where the boats for Venezuela were, were paid for and organized by the Jewish organizations from America.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now when you get to Paris, do you very quickly try to get visas?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We did, but that was of no avail, because visas were usual -- usually given to categories of people rather than individuals.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And what were the categories?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The categories were those who lied about their religion, and who lied about their economic status, or what they could contribute to Venezuela.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And -- but you immediately applied to go to the United States, is that correct?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We did, but they told us that this takes time. So do you want to leave now for Venezuela or await better luck with visa applications to America?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. And you decided to wait.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think partly it was my doing. I said I don't want to go to a country where I have to lie in order to be allowed in.
