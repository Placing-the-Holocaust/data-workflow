<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. We are on now. Would you tell me your full name please?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My full name is Yehudah Mandel, or in English Lewis Y. Mandel. The Y, of course, stands for Yehudah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Where were you born and when were you born?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was born in a very small village called Csepe, spelled C-S-E-P-E in Hungary. That in the part of Hungary which was extremely religious. Later on, it became :</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What year were you born?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In 1904, March the 3rd.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Will you tell me about your parents and about your family as a young child?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: This village or rather the inhabitants, Jewish inhabitants of this village, were extremely religious, very observant people, and so, of course, were my parents. My father who had ordination to be a Rabbi studied in his youth as a...different Yeshivas, but he never was a Rabbi to be employed as a Rabbi. My mother was a sweet, wonderful soul who unfortunately ended in Auschwitz. My father died at age 53. Now we were seven brothers and sisters. I had three sisters and beside myself...I'm the oldest one of the boys...there were other three boys. You want me to give you the names. No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No. We'll get the names later.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: What...uh...Tell me about what your life was like as children.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: As children, everybody's life was the same as mine, so | will tell you about my own life. At the age of 3, 3 and a half, maybe 4...uh...I started to go to Cheder. That's the Jewish school.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>And I think when I was four, maybe 4 and a half years old, I read Hebrew very well. I, of course, didn't understand, but I knew how to read Hebrew very well. And I went on through that Cheder and in that Cheder where we started first to learn prayers. Later on we extended to other things, like the Bible and so on. And...uh...this occupied our lives. We went to Cheder in the morning about 6:30, stayed there, had a service in the Cheder proper, a daily service, and at 8 o'clock, we had to go to the public school. We were in the public school until 11:00. From 11:00 to 12:00, we went back to the Cheder, and were there until noontime.</p><p>The main meal in Eurone. vou know. used to be in noontime. And._uh.._inthe <span class="page-break" number="0"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was it like being a Jew in that town? Was there much anti-Semitism? Were you comfortable? This village had two...uh..churches. One was a Greek Catholic church, and the other was a reform church. The priest of the Greek Catholic church did announce before Passover...weeks before Passover...that now will come the time when the Jews are looking for blood to the...for the Matzahs. Now you can imagine what impression this made on the inhabitants and the children who were taught by this priest and his helpers. So that it happened that when we came out of the Cheder, our own age children were waiting for us with big heavy sticks to beat up the Jewish children, Jews, because we killed Christ and so on. That the...all, that's all they knew. The reformed priest...uh...priest, he was more consilient. And from that school...from that church, we have never heard this kind of...uh..._pronouncement, let's say.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: As a young boy, you early became interested in music. Uh...Tell me how you became interested in music and what happened with the music.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I did not become or rather I wasn't able to study music, if you are referring to study music, and prepare myself for my profession. However, I knew one thing. I had a very nice, pleasant voice and when I was 8 years old, let's say, it was a rarity to...to happen, I was chosen to perform on the three festival days, the evening service, the Maror service. And I did that. And I had a very pleasant voice and that's all I knew, but there was no possibility to study music as much. I...I couldn't do that at all.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell us really about your growing up and how you did be...be able to study music eventually.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I.... was...I lived in my little community up to the age of my Bar Mitzvah. After Bar Mitzvah, I left...uh...my village, and I went to study in a place. It was close by, about 15 kilometers from our village. And I studied in Notchulus. That was the Capitol city of our State. I come from a State which was called Ugochar. And while being there, we had a special minyan for the Bikurim...for the Bikurim. And the Birkurim minyan.... uh...being that my friends and the other students knew I have a pleasant voice I was always asked and...uh...</p><p>sometimes forced to perform the services like the Musaf services on Sabbath or when it was Rosh Hodesh, something like that. So from there on, I knew that I have voice...a voice and it seemed to be I have a nice voice because I was engaged by a who...who...who served a laroer communitv to sine with him at._.in his choir on the Hich Holv Davs. That was <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> 19...1918, and from there because the Rabbi in a certain big place, big congregation, big city, Umegra was a former schoolmate of my father and they studied together. They were : My father insisted I should go to study in Umgra. I went and stayed there for close to 4 years. I got my first...uh....Hiruia from...from Umgra.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Your what?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Hiruia is the written...uh...document to be qualified as a Rabbi in ___, and from Umgra, I studied there up to the point where I was drafted into the Czech army. Now, in Umgra I don't have to tell you it was an extremely...uh... religious community as well, and for instance, we, _ Bikurim who studied under this Rabbi who I told you about before, were told that when we walk by the Reform Temple at a certain street we cannot...we shouldn't walk on the side of the temple. We have to cross the street and walk by to the next block and only then go back to that side of the street. This...from this can give you...uh...picture the way we lived.</p><p>Now, one thing, however, was very good. The...uh...discipline, not only this which may sound here in America funny and foolish, but the discipline in every way was so immense, it's hard even to describe it. Everyone stuck to...to the...to the rules of...of Yeshiva, whatever it was. The best (clearing throat) (drinking water) (pause) To give you an idea how strict the discipline followed or...or prevailed there, I have to tell you a very little story. I had a nice voice, and when I was already about 15 or 16 years old, somehow the cantor of that community, of that congregation, which was strictly 100 percent an orthodox congregation, and their cantor was a man by the name Gottleb, who heard my voice and wanted me to join his choir. My father, who was a ___ friend, former schoolmate of the Rabbi under whom I studied, came especially to Umgra to speak to this Rabbi and ask him could I, would I, would he allow me to sing in that choir. The Rabbi did not give me permission or whatever.</p><p>He used to go to that shul.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Take some water. Take your time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So I did not have the opportunity to study music even to the degree what this choir that sang in the Orthodox shul would have given me. And so I grew up without any musical backeround. However. I was a verv 200d which means I could lead anv service and <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> called or ___ in Yiddish used to deliver the milk for the Yeshiva it should be...uh...100 percent kosher. And so...uh...uh...one day at where my classmates and other Bikurim forced me in...in...in to perform the service, the Musaf service. One man who brought milk in the big can walked by and heard me. And he asked one of the Bikurim who is the ___ who is governing there. So he says he's not a__. He's just a one of us, _.</p><p>And the man then waited for me until I was finished and spoke to me. Because this was very close to Umgra they would come and pick me up. Would I perform a service of Shavuot in their congregation...in his congregation. (Clearing Throat Pause) We went out there. Yeah.</p><p>He also said I can invite as many friends as I want and they won't come back empty handed.</p><p>So I performed the service, got paid...uh...in this and my friends were loaded up with all kind of goodies. Butter and cheese and...and eggs and what not. So everyone was very happy. Later on, this went from mouth to mouth and I was invited to different towns for little congregations, bigger congregations. I became a star. And I _____ and this maintained myself financially plus my two brothers who came to study in the same Yeshiva later.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When...as this developed, tell us what...when did you get your first...your own congregation?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Now, after the Yeshiva...let me go back for a moment yet to the...to the Yeshiva. My father...before the brother was the youngest, David, brought up my...my youngest brother in short...in shorts to...to be introduced to the Rabbi and asked if he could join also. The three of us were already studying there, so maybe David could study too. And the Rabbi took a lot at him with the short pants and said, "No." He told my ....my father gave this Rabbi...uh...a lot of ...uh...uh...honor. They used to be on first name term as young people. He called him Rebbe and he called my father Avrom. So he said to my father, "Avrom, I don't have a Cheder. I have a big Yeshiva." So my father told him. I ask of you one thing. Listen to this young boy with the , the short pants. He knows the pages of Talmud by heart almost. The Rabbi gave him an exam and told my father, "You know what. Your fourth boy, David. Buy him long pants. He can study in Yeshiva." Now you asked me when did I get my first professional...uh...engagement let's say. (Pause - drinking water) Actually, I got my first professional engagement when I was drafted into the Czech army. We finished the semester in Yeshiva. And I had to report to the...uh...military on the Ist of October. However, it came out that the beginning of October were the High Holy Days. So I traveled and finally I got the nosition in a place _ And there IT done the whole service. There was an <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> two...namely, this is history, when orthodox departed from the Nelro congregations, there were some who didn't go on either side, but remained where they were status quo. No change.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Thank you. Okay. So you're now leaving the Czech army. What happened?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I served in the Czech army and maybe it's a very interesting thing too. And indicative of my life and the way I...the way we were disciplined and the way we lived. At..uh...the basic training which everyone had to follow...follow through, I think at the beginning of November when the birthday of the President of Czechoslovakia, at the time, Masaryk, which was President, was celebrated. Uh...First Lieutenant came out to the training grounds and asked if is there...if there is someone who has a nice voice and could sing the Yanick part in the _T never in mv life un to the 20th birthdav was in a movie or knew <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> for...for...uh... operatic career." I was flabbergasted and I didn't know how to handle it, and I didn't dare even to tell my parents, namely my father, that this kind of a happiness and great career was standing before me. However, I had an uncle, my brother...my mother's brother who was a lawyer, who studied in Budapest and came down, was a lawyer later on in our vicinity. Was about 40 miles...40 kilometers from our village. I wrote to him. I didn't dare to approach my father directly. So he went over and told my father about this big luck, tremendous thing what...what I'm confronted with. And my father's answer was, "Moshe,"...that was his...my uncle's name...."We have four sons and three daughters. If ...that's my Yiddish name...will do that he will go to the and desecrate the Sabbath, and desecrate the High...the Holy Days and sing in this career," which in my...in his own opinion wasn't...uh...the way a Yid should lead his life, "then please tell me that we have only three sons and three girls." That's a cruel thing, but it ended my operatic career, so when I came home... My father wanted, of course... was already 20...in my 2Ist year, I should get married and settle there in a beautiful store, very rich people, and the only thing I would have to do is count the money and be in the...and so on. Uh...So I didn't want this. I wanted still to go privately and study music. And my father didn't give in on the other hand, so the deal between us was made. No Academy of music. No marriage. But back to Yeshiva. And then I went back to Yeshiva to Pressberg where I studied for about...uh...2 years and that was my last Yeshiva, and there I got my second which is....you know what a is?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Explain it for the camera.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: is again a written document of the Rabbinic court that the person is qualified to be a Rabbi. That was the second part. From there, from Vienna which is very close to...from _, Pressberg, which is very close to once in a...in awhile I used to go to Vienna. I had a teacher there and there I already I already started to learn some music. However, I stayed the Yeshiva. I...1 couldn't leave the Yeshiva.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you father and the Yeshiva head know that you were study?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He wouldn't have like it. He wouldn't have like it. Uh...Maybe he wouldn't have minded my knowledge of the music, but he surely would have minded that I'm leaving Yeshiva and go to there to study. Now in Pressberg there were many smaller congregations, synagogues and they knew that I knew how to _____. They invited me. And this is what I made a living for myself from, and this is what gave me the opportunity financially to travel to Vienna and take some lessons. So there it started. One Saturday, when I_____ after the ,aman came over to me and told me he is from Vienna. He works in Vienna. He's originally from Pressburg, works in Vienna at and is a member of a congregation called Temple. _ and their _ 9 yvoune man iust left and he thinks TI will be the nroner <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> After this, there was a written out for...uh..the looked for a cantor for its 21st . That's a district.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: .</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The is not as strict as the Budapest ____ because there the</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Translation.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Taxes. The taxes were not collected by the...by the state if the person, let's say a Jew didn't pay to the Jewish community. However, it was extremely well organized and the...the</p><p> central congre...central congregation let's say had its offices and its</p><p> administration. They...uh...they...uh...the nations and the...were always coming in well, and they never had any financial troubles. There the only thing was...was similar to...to the Hungarian setup was that they also had synagogues for each district, led and controlled by the Central Congregation. Now when I applied for this...uh...congrega...for this position at the - <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> shuls. No side temples. No nothing. One congregation with 800 Jewish families, an organ, a magnificent choir of 40, a choir leader, an organist. In other words, the service was organized better than any one or as good as anyone could imagine. As I say, I served there for 6 years. Between the 5th and 6th year, I get a letter from a man by the name Mr. _ from all places in Kovno, from Kovno. He writes to me and says, namely in the 30s. This was around the 30s. I started to give concerts of Jewish content, of synagogue contents, let's say, in the state radio in Belgrade. And I used to give these concerts and he heard me and said...he wrote in Yiddish that he liked what he heard and he would like to know if I would be willing to come down to that part of the world, Kovno and so on, to give a few concerts.</p><p>Money is no problem, and in order to make sure that I understand it money is no problem, he will have in a few days write to me and suggest to me by an official office concert bureau, and this bureau, which is a recognized concert arranger and organizer, will write to me and I should be in contact with them, tell them what I want, and he is backing it, and money is no problem. I shouldn't forget that. So when I started to prepare for this road from south...he was from Yugoslavia, which was south, ....uh...to the cold vicinity of Kovno, Russia...former Russia, my own family asked me, "Are you crazy? You have the most magnificent position here. Everyone likes you. You have no problem. You make three times as much money as you can spend. Even your wife is...is engaged by the State." She was a school teacher.</p><p>"Where are you running? What are you trying to accomplish? What are you trying to do?" However, as a young man...let's not forget, in 1933 I was still only a very young, very, very young man. And I was interested what's on the other side. So I went. And I sanged two Saturdays. I performed services in Kovno, in the so-called . That's a big time temple there. And...uh...I sang twice for the benefit of Yeshivas, Yeshiva. And all under his guidance. This man...this Mr. __ was a millionaire, very rich person, and he had part of his...of his mansions, so to say, advice given to me so that I can study and sing and learn and do whatever I want and he made sure that one of his...uh...uh...carriages...uh... Of course, it was a carriage and horse wagon will take me whenever I have to go to rehearsal, whenever I have to go for a...for a choir practice and so on. And I was there for about 2 weeks.</p><p>Suddenly, and everything was beautiful, very good. So suddenly, one Shavuot he introduces me to a man by the name Mr. Becker. Mr. Becker was the President of the in Riga.</p><p>And Mr. Becker told me, "They are seeking the services of a Hazan for 2 years already.</p><p> _ was their cantor before I came there, and they would like very much if 1 could come over for...to give a audition in the . [went and performed services and it was left to...rather they had 82 people for... uh...to audition, and they...they were left with three. One was their former cantor, , who was a great opera singer in his time, and the second was a man by the name who was...came from...uh...from Yohannesburg, and myself. In Riga, it developed to be a great...uh...a great affair let's say. There were the</p><p> ____, and the , and the . However, there was a great__, the so-called</p><p> ____ with whom I became very friendly. And...uh...when these people just couldn't get to first base and many people wanted me and this...uh...the end was told them, "If you want , you'll take Mandel. If you want opera singer, you take and so on." So finallv. IT was elected in the _ and we went there. And we lived in Riga <span class="page-break" number="7"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay. So you are in Riga. It was 36, 37, early 38. What was it like. What were conditions like in Riga at that point?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: This is a very good question. I will answer it to you. My answer to my own people who criticize me that I'm leaving Novi Sad was this Mr. Becker took me, showed me Riga. First of all, he got a magnificent city. Not that there's anything wrong with Novi Sad, but Riga was a magnificent city. A tremendously, culturally developed...high culture in every way you can mention. There was a steady opera. There were Jewishly spoken. Mr. Becker took me not only to Yeshivas, but he took me to day schools where the teaching went on from kindergarten on up to university. Everything was taught in Hebrew. And these schools were recognized as regular schools and you could go to any university with a diploma from that school, from those schools. And I said to myself and with my wife, "Look, if we will ever have a child, let me him go to this kind of a school because there is Yiddish and _, Jewish...Jewishness and humanism bound together as I have rarely seen it anywhere else.</p><p>And this was one of the reasons we went to Riga. In Riga, we acquired many, many friends...many, many admirers. However, when...uh...the call came from Budapest that they need a Hazan in Temple, I thought this is still the highest point any cantor can...can look for or wait for, namely Riga itself as beautiful congregation as it was, it wasn't an organized congregation, let's say like Budapest you know where law ruled the congregation, where church and...uh...and faith was...was divided. So after long, long, long speculation and consideration, we...we decide we both were born in Hungary, spoke Hungarian very well, and...uh...and we decided to leave Riga. Now, how I came to Budapest is the story...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: We're going to have to condense it. Can you just tell us about being in Budapest.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Now, I came to Budapest, and I put it this way. I came to Budapest in 1936. I was elected and I did not go back to Riga anymore because I was concerned if I go back, I won't be able to...to leave there. Because people and I have many, many friends and admirers and so I stayed in Riga...in Budapest, with the excuse that I will start now to rehearse for the High Holy Days. In Budapest, there were two main temples. One was the traditional where I served. the Temple. and the other was the Temple. The was biooer. <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> 0 was a narrow street, police had to be brought in every time when we had services in order that when the people leave the synagogue they shouldn't kill each other. And this I think is a very interesting thing, and I want to include it in this discussion here. We were down as I have already said, we... served in..uh...Budapest 10 years, from 1936 to 46. In 41, I think it was...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Let's not jump. Okay. Let's...Let's try to stay in order here. Okay?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Uh...Things began to change. You were here as the...the chief cantor, but the world around you began to change in 1938.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: 1939,</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The first...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did things begin to change?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The first and second...uh...Jewish law against the Jews rather. You know what that means.</p><p>Jewish law. That meant Jews couldn't hold any positions at government. Jews couldn't later on have even their own business. Uh...Non-Jews couldn't have been seen by Jewish doctors.</p><p>Jews couldn't serve as physicians in...in hospital or even have their own office. This was in...started in 1938 and continued in 1939 and went on to the point when...uh...the German then occupied Hungary finally. But as far as..-uh...the beginning is concerned, it was...when I came to Budapest, I was given working papers, so-called working papers, permission to work as a non-Hungarian citizen in Hungary for...I got permission for 4 years. In other words, I should have been in good order up until 1940. But as soon as...after the first High Holy Days. That means before 1937 already, the French policei. The ones who controlled the people who...who are not citizen butt in and they made sure that we will be asked to leave Hungary or arrest us. So that danger was tremendously big and that was the time when I think in 1938 or the beginning of 39, I went to London to try out there. And I was elected.</p><p>However, I came back to Budapest because 3 days after this...uh...Saturday when I nerformed services. the President of that conoregation. I should have been <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> 1 because the big trouble really continued, which started as a said before that the doctors couldn't be doctors. The lawyers could be lawyers. The professionals couldn't be professionals anymore. It expanded to the point where me, at the time, yet younger Jews were called into labor camp and I was one of them. I was called in and...uh...I served for the first time in...not too far from Budapest, in a place Shirastopeck, meaning nothing. We built airports. I'm asking you for what. I don't think an airplane ever... ever appeared there. But we did. Just to...to make it hard on us. And this went on almost to the very end. The first two years I would say 38, 39 and maybe the beginning of 40. Yeah. I was still within the border of Hungary. I was called in many, many times, but not over...not sent over the border. Later on...uh...toward the end of the...of the war, we were in Galicea. We were in Poland. We were in former Russia un to the Dunn River we went. and that's the wav thev us and cave <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> 2 Tape #2</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. We're on. Yes. The camera is back on. Uh...Cantor Mandel, in Budapest around 1941 with all of this happening, what was it like for you, for your family, inside the house?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was terrible and worse yet in other families, but as far as I and we were concerned, I was still employed by the congregation. I got my monthly check and we could make a living.</p><p>However, my mother remained at the time still in that village where I was born. My father has died already, so I brought her up to...to Budapest and she lived for a very short while in our house and later on, she lived...my brother became a student at the Rabbinical Seminary at the University because that was...uh...the Seminary student had to finish college as well.</p><p>They had to get a degree from the university. So in order to save him from labor camp when he came up, I made sure that he is...he will be there as a student of the Rabbinical...of the Rabbinical...the Rabbinical...uh...Seminary. It was no problem because he had a tremendous amount of Hebrew knowledge. And...uh...in...uh...1939, 40, even the beginning of 41, if we wanted to get something good, it had to be sent to us from Novi Sad. For instance, we...we needed some meat for Passover, so my in-laws sent with a cert....by a certain man, who was the superintendent of our buildings in Novi Sad, they sent up...I don't know...geese and whatever we needed. Uh...Jews...later after the second law again the Jews couldn't go out to the store at any time during the day and buy anything. They had a certain hour or two...I don't remember exactly...during the day when they could go out. And of course when they...when they could go out everything was gone. It was a very, very hard life with a lot of things missing. We were very lucky because my in-laws who lived in Yugo...in Yugo...again that was formerly Yugoslavia was Hungary again. They helped us out with many things.</p><p>Now, as far as within the family, everything was fine because we had the...the benefit of the big congregation and everyone knew...uh...who we are and didn't bother us too much.</p><p>However, when it came to...uh...being a Jew it didn't make any difference when the...when it was handled by the Nazis, the Hungarian Nazis. And so...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What does that mean?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It means that when the hack and cross, the...the Hungarian Nazis, you know, came because they were members of...of their...their organization, and they wanted you to show them where you are born and then you have the right to be here and you are a Hungarian citizen.</p><p>Even if you were a Hungarian citizen, it didn't mean a thing because the laws covered...covered already everything what could destroy Jewish life or Jews in general.</p><p>Now, when a family cannot go out and cannot live their own lives for...for...this is against the law, that's a terrible, terrible thing. I did one more thing in Budapest which I probably have never mentioned, but I will mention it now. This Mr. Epler, who was the Secretary General of the congregation, after the first Jewish law, after the first law against the Jew....when that was passed, he asked me if I could help out in the congregation and organize a district in the 7th district, which didn't exist before. People were taken up or rather thrown out from their own homes and they were moved together with other people, so there was a big problem. One family was kosher, kosher; the other wasn't. One family had old <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> 3 people; the other had the young people and children. But they were moved together in apartments, and other apartments were taken away because there were some districts where the Jews couldn't live at all, and these Jews had to be placed where this was still a possibility for them to live. Now, I organized the 7th inner district at the time, and made sure that we know who is a Jew, who is not a Jew, who keeps a kosher home; who doesn't; and so and so that they forced getting together of these families in one apartment instead of three or four was let's say a little bit easier done than it could have been done if this information wouldn't have been available. And I was the secretary of that 6th...7th district for quite awhile (drinking water) so that we had a complete listing of the Jews who lived around us, about...</p><p>Yeah, and this, of course, was already done and allowed to be done by the Germans and the Hungarian Nazis because this was preparatory to the ghetto so that the Jews would be together already. And this was done. Now what is your next question?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What happened to you as the years progressed?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: As the years progressed, 1940...Yeah, all the time, starting from 1938, either I was home for 4 weeks and then called back to the labor camp and was there for 2 months let's say. And I had the congregation force their way through their influences that I was allowed again to come home for let's say the month of the...of the High Holy Days or any holiday or Pesach or Shuef. So I came home and I stayed home for...for the time I was allowed to stay home...to stay home. And the winter months as a rule were taken more easy than the summer months.</p><p>Summer months we almost constantly were in camp and for the winter months, sometimes we were allowed to...uh...g0 home and we lived there. Now what happened for instance, I can tell you one interesting thing about 1941 if we have time. In 1941, my sister-in-law who lived in Novi Sad, came for a visit to Budapest. And at the time our son, Emmy...Manny, was a very small child. He was born in 1936, and this sister-in-law, who loved him with all her heart, she told my wife, her sister, "Look, the child has a cold. He's coughing and all that.</p><p>Novi Sad is still about a 100 kilometer south. I will take him down. Maybe his cough with subside easier there." So we went with her and...uh...I made arrangements because there were two chief cantors in Temple that mv colleasue who was with me will take <span class="page-break" number="11"></span> 4 Danube River, and they were shot into the River. They were shot and fell into the River.</p><p>Now, this went on for a long time. We saw trucks arriving there with ___ and Jewish people and they were all put into a line. I think a line of two and there was always a gendarme or a policeman who was told and informed by the government that all these people who are being...who are being taken here are being taken here because they are the enemies of Hungary. The really...the newly occu...back occupied Hungary because you know that was Yugoslavia. It was Hungary, then Yugoslavia, then the Hungarians occupied it again. So when our next came, before us was standing the owner of the house...uh... where my sister- in-law lived. When our next came, the policeman came over. I was holding Manny in my coat, in my fur coat because he...he had fever, and...uh...he took a look at me and said...uh..."What are you doing here? Chief Cantor, what are you doing here? You are not a Czechnik?" Czechnik meant the...the people who hated Hungary. The serp people and others who hated Hungary. You are no Czechnik. And he was all terribly excited, and ran over to the Lieutenant who was there was in charge and told him, "The...the Chief Cantor from the _____ is here. He's...he's not a cheknik. He's...I know him, and I "m there many times." Namely, as I told you before, the Temple was a very narrow street and because people were pouring out and would have been in danger, endangered each other, so he was...he and other 10 people were there and he was in charge of that group of policeman.</p><p>So he knew me very well. And this while he was running back and forth, and at the third or fourth try, the lieutenant told him, "Put him aside. Stand him...let him stand aside." This saved our lives because Hortee (pause - drinking water) Hortee then called off the killing, and this is when it stopped at our . So if anyone will tell me this story, I wouldn't believe it, but it's true.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can you go back to that scene with these people at the River? Tell me what it was like, what you saw, and what you were like. What was the scene like at the River?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The scene was...the scene was 29 degrees celsius. People were crying, and when we heard tut, tut, tut, tut, another few shots, we...we knew what's happening. We imagined what's happening. And people were crying and hollering and...and throwing themselves to the floor, to the ground and as...as...as...as can well be imagined what happened. But before we should have gone in and be the next ones to be killed, the killing stopped. From there, we were taken into a...into a gymnasium...uh...walked back and...uh...when we spoke about where we are going and...and what happened, the...uh....one of the policeman was walking along side with us told me, "You are very lucky people. I don't know if you know what's happened inside the thev called it. It was a bathing ston at the Danube in Novi Sad all the time. <span class="page-break" number="12"></span> 5 the Danube River by 10 or 12 and shot into the River. This happened. Later on, this became a daily occurrence in 43 and...uh...and 44.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you see some of these roundups?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The roundups I did see because even from the place where I stayed... My family wasn't with me at the time. They were in Bergen-Belsen at the time because...uh...there was... uh...an effort to save some people, and there were sixteen hundred and some people...Jews who were transported from Budapest to...uh...through...through different stops, but finally they got to Bergen Belsen. This was a Catholic group if you know about it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Alright. I would like you to pause. I would like you to tell us the story of how your family became part of the group that went to Bergen Belsen.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Now, my family became part of...of this Bergen Belsen, the Kosner group as they called it...uh...because my brother and I were very active in Zionistic work and the people knew that so whoever was in charge of this Kosner group they said...though I wasn't home at the time...I was probably in the Ukrainian at the time already...they said, "Though (that's my Hungarian name) isn't home, we cannot forget...uh...Ella and...and their...their son, Emmy, and they...they were engaged and my brother-in-law's still there as a Rabbinical student he was not taken into...into labor camp. So he was extremely active. He probably had something to do with it to...to bring it to the attention of the people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You would have been in the Ukraine in labor camps?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In labor camps?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Labor camps. And my family was...was in Budapest. So they were taken with the Kosner group. First it was that they go straight to Israel, then it was said the...as I hear now from people who were part of the group...uh...they were...they were supposed to go to Auschwitz and finally, they made up to go to Bergen-Belsen.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did you find out that your family had been taken?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I did not find out...uh...until I didn't come back...until I didn't escape in...uh... November, the end of November. In --Tleftthe comnanyv. comnanvy. and we walked mainlv <span class="page-break" number="13"></span> 6</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You are in which town where? You are in where?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Now, you have to understand what happened.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes, please.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: As the Germans got...got...as...the Russians performed their attacks against the Germans pushing them from east to west, so the labor camp people...the labor camp laborers, Jews, were always pushed together with them. Why? Because the Germans and even the Hungarians had a tremendous amount of food and other necessities in different places and we had to hurry up and load the wagons and...and trains for them that their material should be taken...uh...westwards instead of being taken by the Russians. So we moved always with this ...with this attack. (Cough) And finally, when we got to ShotroyRehe, I heard that....at ShotroyRehe, there is an organization (coughing - drinking water) which takes the Jews in the direction of Vienna they told us at the time and whoever cannot walk is shot. So I spoke to a few people who I could reach and told them I am doing this. If you want to come with me, maybe a great risk but this is what I will do. And that must have been the beginning of November. When we were already pushed back to the point of...uh...my birthday's let's say...0F...0r</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: November of what year?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: November of 1944. And so we left the company and tried to get in the direction of Budapest and it took about 10 or 12 or 14 days until we accomplished our goal to get to Budapest.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Could you tell me...Really, I would like to know how you got away from the camp and what that walk was like.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The...the getting away from the camp was simply take a risk every second of the...of that time to be shot by a Hungarian Nazi. Not necessarily a...a man, but a 12, 13 year old boy who had a gun and if he shot a Jew, they probably gave him a thank you. Not...uh....he didn't...he wasn't exposed to any punishment or anything of that. And this is the way we got away. We just slipped away, left everything what we had, and had the same clothes and the same shoes, maybe sometimes without soles, but we...we went in the direction of Budapest because we thought there is the revenge. I remember walking through a town immediately...uh...the...at the border of Budapest where there were Hungarian papers who said THE FALL OF BUDAPEST IS EXPECTED ANY HOUR. THE RUSSIANS ARE HERE AND THERE IN THIS AND THIS SPOT. And when I came to Budapest the ghetto, of course was...L...we...we didn't know that there was a ghetto in Budapest. The ghetto was already working. The Jews were already concentrated in the ghetto. As I heard later, the Germans have prepared to...uh...to put some bombs in the ghetto and...and to kill all the Jews who are there, but this didn't happen and when I arrived in...uh... Budapest the 17th of November, I took my life... I knew already that my family is in Rome. <span class="page-break" number="14"></span> 7</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because my...the place where we lived was part of the ghetto, and a friend of mine who lived in one of the so-called...uh...houses which were...which were not... which were except...an exception and not ghetto...how did they call them?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Protected house?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Protective house. Uh...He told me that my family went with this and group to the Kosner group and he doesn't know where they are now, but they are not home. Ella and the child and another...uh...relative's child of ours went with my brother and my wife to...with...with the Kosner group.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell us what you.... You can slow down. Please. Tell us what your reaction was when you heard this news.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My reaction was...first, I will... will...I'll start at the first reaction which I got when I arrived and I took my life into my life into my hand because you couldn't walk into the ghetto and walk out of the ghetto. So we were about...I was about 2 blocks let's say from the place where our apartment was and | at one...one early morning, as I have said, took my life into my hands and through all kinds of machinations, I got to the place where our apartment...the house where our apartment was. Our apartment was on the top floor, magnificent apartment, with Persian rugs and pictures and this and that. And every piece of furniture in that anartment was done bv the._ by the meister. vou know. And when I came in throuch <span class="page-break" number="15"></span> 8 to the...the...uh... Swedish man, Raul...uh...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Wallenberg?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Wallenberg. To the Wallenberg offices, get the Schutzpasses, be told where they have to be taken because they were in contact, and I as a Hungarian soldier can walk on the street freely...uh...L...it wasn't so, but...but that's the way it was planned and I should take these Schutzpasses to the different spots where they are needed. This was my work after I came back from...from labor camp let's say. Many times I did something else. People were by the hundreds maybe thousands gathered in the concentration prison. There was such a thing in Pest, and there they were not only mishandled and so on, but many, many terrible things happened to them. Once we were told that in the Tolence house, that's the place from where they are thrown over the border, there...I don't know how many people...and we...the people who were assigned for this mission, dressed up in Hungarian gendarme uniforms and went to the place where they were gathered. This is in this case the Tolance house prison. And we cursed them and we said the worse things about the Jews and so, but we took I don't know maybe 50 or 60 Jews, and we had machine guns and ___ and we... we ...we got them out.</p><p>The oot them out bv false naners. of course. that we will take care of them. We are <span class="page-break" number="16"></span> 9</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. There...there...there were offices, official offices where only the Consulate or close by.</p><p>They occupied another room or something. They did the best they could. There wasn't you go out and rent an apartment or rent an office. They did it the best they could. The official business was always handled from the Consulate itself. The non-officials, the falsifications, the printing jobs, the...the military there, what...what we used...uh...I don't know...uniforms, guns, and so on, they were kept somewhere else. And meetings were always in...never in the Consulates of course. They were in these private places.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did you meet other people connected with Wallenberg?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Only my own kind because many people did one thing or another for...for the...for the cause.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>There was a Dr. _ who worked very closely with...he was one of the Rabbis in Budapest at the time. Verv closelv. Dr. and others and._.and mv kind who either went in because <span class="page-break" number="17"></span> 0</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Will you know take us through one of those trips where you freed Jews from the Tolance house and tell us what that scene was like.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The scene was 10 or 12 Jews, strong, young people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Excuse me. Repeat...repeat questions so the camera knows where you are.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Huh?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You were asked where were you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In Budapest. And...uh...they...our administration knew very well who they have, and people who they could count on. In other words, they were really not broken down old people or ...or young people who can't move. They were people who were strength and energy and they...they knew if they will be dressed up as gendarmes, they will be gendarmes. They will act as gendarmes. Uh...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The Tolence house now.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. Now, so when we got the command, let's say to go free these people in the Tolence house we got dressed and got together at a certain spot, wherever we were told. On a street corner because we...we weren't Jews. You know, we were...we were...uh...Christians and...uh...we got together wherever we told and from there under the direction of the one who was assigned to be the...the officer, the commander of this group and who was dressed up as a...a lieutenant or something like that, he...we went in marched form up the place where we had to do the job. And when we got there, the man took the paper and showed it to...to whoever it was in charge there and told him we will take these damn Jews and do the right thing with them. Don't worry Comrade. Just give them to us. So...uh...if there were 20 or 50 or...or whatever amount of people, we took them and while we...and as soon as we got out of the...of the Tolence house which was, of course, protected by all kinds of gates and what not, as soon as we felt that we can tell the people, we marched close by to them, "Don't worry. This is...this is just a play. You will be saved. We take you to this and this place, and we came here. We are Jews and we will...we will ..we won't kill you. You...we take you where you should be." And so the people quieted down and they...they came with us and marched with us, and we took them wherever they...we were told to take this. This is...this was the scene. Uh... You have to know that in those days the streets of Budapest were completely empty. There was very little ...uh...uh...cars, very few cars. Anyhow, but there...there was no...no...no communication. People didn't walk on the street. They simply were scared, let along... mean like cars or something like that. You very very rarely that you saw that at the time. First of all, most of the vehicles were taken by the...by the military, and second of all, who dared to go to the street? I mean there was bombing going on and...and what not, so they were just scared. Uh...Jews, of course, didn't dare to go out, and other people were scared too. So we could...uh...we could very well do our stick, whatever we had to do there. <span class="page-break" number="18"></span> 1</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What other kinds of things did you do with the underground? This was with the Zionist underground?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. With the Zionist underground. What other things? I stayed in..-uh...we had to be...we had to bring...and we had to bring in paper and we had to...any kind of thing, whatever there was to be done. There was no such a thing like...we didn't have any water in the last times already because the water was cut off. So I stayed with a...with a dish and waited until I got enough water to bring it up to make a tea or..or boil it to some soup with...with something in it or...or bring it to an old person, an elderly person or a sick person. Give them a drink of water. That was one of the jobs we had to do. And it wasn't only myself. Many people...uh...did the same thing. We went down to the cellar where a little bit of pressure was still on, and gathered the water from the pipes which were in the cellar and so we took it up to the 4th, 5th floor for...to be used for...for whatever it is needed. And that went for...for bread and for cheese and for...for...for whatever we could put our hands on. Now, I had to go out and let's say bring back some bread. So I knew where the bakeries are for I live in Budapest. And...uh...so I went there, and if I got some bread I had a...uh...coat, a white coat. I put my...I put...I'll never forget that...that was a specialty...have a bag, put my hand into the suits there. It's in my pocket, but actually I was holding the bread underneath my coat, and I walked home. Now, you know, the...this kind of terrible, terrible experience teaches people to do many, many things which you never thought you are able to do.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The...the winter of 44, I gather, was very cold. Will you tell me about it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Terribly cold. Terribly cold. The main thing I can tell you is...then I have to flash back to...uh...uh...Novi Sad. It was 28 below celsius, is...that would be about 50 something like that. And while we were, let's say, in ...uh...in...in Budapest during 44 and so, we were very young and we could stand it. And then we had very good training in Russia and with the Ukraine where we were in labor camp to get used to these things. Sometimes, the snow was a meter or meter and half tall or high, and people slept on...in the snow.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: They slept in the snow?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In the snow. Yes. Put on their coat. Crawled into the...in the snow and the snow kept them warm. Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In that winter of 44...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: 44, early 45, who were your friends in the underground that were doing the same things you were?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: As I told you, there was this Haskowich, who was one of my best friends. He was a brother <span class="page-break" number="19"></span> 2 of a colleague of mine. And ...uh...he...he gave me the first information about my family. Of course, I tried to get to Kosner. I had difficulties to get in. He was an extremely busy person, but finally I got to him and found out that my family is still not in Switzerland. They are still in...uh...in Bergen-Belsen. Uh...During this...uh...1944, after January...I don't remember, probably the 18th of January, when Russian soldier appeared in the cellar of that house where we were, we knew that every minute, every hour is danger. Nothing else. When this Russian soldier arrived, we thought we are freed, but it wasn't like that. The Russians just didn't...didn't just redeem us. They brought all kinds of problems. I...you probably know about that. Uh...There's a story in that. And there were cases where soldiers carried 15 and 18 watches and nut them on their arm. and is a verv well know phrase known to <span class="page-break" number="19"></span> 3 rebuilt the Temple, the part of the part of the Temple which was ruined. This was what I did after the...after the liberation. Between the...so that on the High Holy Days, we already went back to the Temple as a Temple and had services in the Temple, though there wasn't a seat left or so. But temporarily it was...it was fixed.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell us about finding your family. The time is short.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Now finding the family was this. As I wrote from time to time and didn't get answers, finally I got an answer. This letter that I told you about before. I knew...finally, I had to realize in spite of the wonderful prospects I have in Budapest where I could keep my position. I could become the Secretary General of the Jewish Chaplaincy Service in Budapest because Dr.</p><p>Heroshi was the Chief Chaplain and he begged me to...to be his assistant. I cannot wait or I cannot hope my family should ever come...come back. So... uh...my first...uh...my last...uh...cable or was it a letter, I don't remember...reached already my family in Bari, Italy, on the way to Israel. So that my wife who was a teacher by profession went to Israel. She had a very dear friend, her classmate from first grade, who was a lawyer in Israel, very respected lawyer. And when they spoke about what she should do...is to go to a kibbutz or take courses and...uh...become a teacher in Israel. She knew Hebrew quite well. Uh...The decision finally was made, "No, she should go to a kibbutz with the children. So, they went to Sharharmikim, where she became a worker, a laborer there first, and later on she became the main..uh...the chief...uh...the chief cook of the kibbutz and I must tell you her food was...what she cooked was extraordinary. And this is the way then finally I took 3 months of absence, of vacation to find my family. I knew where they are, and I knew I will never come back to Budapest and I started out to Budapest. Maybe here's another interesting point.</p><p>When I] started out and the conoregation this time alreadv. the cave me nermission <span class="page-break" number="20"></span> 4 made the Italian government, the Italian forces to arrest us and we spent in Statsia about 9 weeks or 10 weeks. It was about Pesach time. I performed Seder services there I remember.</p><p>Finally, Morrison, who was the Secretary of Labor in the English government and a Jew, came down to us and tried... Yeah...we...we...to convince us we shouldn't have a hunger strike and we shouldn't do this and that, and I wrote especially hymn for the Holy Pesach there and...uh..and that c'est l'appell was everyday and everyone came out and we had a hunger strike for 98 hours.
