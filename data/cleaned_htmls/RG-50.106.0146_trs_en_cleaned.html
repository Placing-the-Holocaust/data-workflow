<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Fred Goldman " November 19, 2001</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was very active in that respect. I loved to play soccer. Later, when Hitler came to power, all Jewish kids joined -- th-th-they founded Jewish sports clubs because we were not allowed to be members of others. So that was also a social outlet for all Jewish kids. So I was very active there. F-F-Field and track, and soccer I played and I was -- I wa -- I was one of the socc -- soccer players on my team and we traveled every Sunday to -- to towns nearby and played games there. I was very active as far as sports are concerned. And I was the -- one of the best athletes in si -- in high school, too. Was my special ambition because being the only Jew in my class, I -- I excelled in that respect, and I knew that the Germans respected people who were physically active and successful.</p></p></dialogue>

Did you have any ideas about a future career?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, I was not -- because the situation changed all the time. When the rights were taken away from all Jews, I -- you had less possibilities and chances t-to go to certain schools and universities. As a matter of fact, shortly after Hitler came to power, Jews could not go to colleges any more, and universities. So I had to change my professional plans all the time.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Fred Goldman " November 19, 2001</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Let's now talk about when Hitler came into power, unless there's anything else you wanted to add pre-Hitler.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Pre-Hitler?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. What is -- okay, so it i -- you were 18 years old -- or 17 and a half when he came into power.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What is your first recollection of Hitler?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My first recollection of Hitler is shortly after he came to power, there was a boycott of all Jewish stores, all over Germany. That me -- it meant that storm troopers stood in front of -- a couple of storm troopers stood in front of all Jewish stores and stopped people from going in. The -- well, that lasted only a couple of days and then they discontinued that, but it made a deep impression on me that time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, when he came into power, you were still in the gymnasium?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right.</p></p></dialogue>

So that was one reason why we all thought it might end very suddenly again. We thought it couldn't last, that Hitler would be thrown out again, and we thought it only for a short while. We couldn't believe that this would stay forever.</p><p>But later on of course, it got more serious.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In the beginning, did you talk things over with your parents about the changes when Hitler came into power? Were they open with you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yes. These were the only people you could talk with about things like them.</p><p>We were always very careful to make remarks about Hitler in the Nazi time, so I spoke only to my -- mainly to my family about this. Actually, my father was not alive any more when Hitler came to power. My father died in 1927.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Wh-What did he die from?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He had a stroke, he was awa-away -- away on vacation and he -- he died of a stroke.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So did your mother keep the business going?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My mother kept the business, and her sister joined -- joined her and to ha -- to -- to be helpful to her, and this way they could keep the business going.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: For the time.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: In the beginning there was hardly any change in 1933, but 30 -- "34, and shortly after that, it slowly changed. In the beginning I was still very friendly with all of -- we were a Class of 25, who stayed together by the way, until the nine years were over, SO we -- we were always together. So I was still very friendly with most -- almost all of them. And then --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: This is boys and girls?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, boys and girls, right. And they kept on talking to me, we had friendly relations, but slowly they all joined the Hitler youth, the Nazi organization. And they didn't stop talking to me, but they were -- they were still more distant. And slowly this changed too, for the worse.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What about your teachers?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: My teachers behaved all right. They didn't show any anti-Semitism, even actually up to the end when -- when I left. When I -- when I -- when high school was over. But I was banned from certain activities in school. When they were in nationalistic celebrations or national holidays, in -- in which I always had taken part of before, we were banned from these thing -- I was banned from there, which I actually didn't mind.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, being the only Jew in my class, I -- I was the only one. So of course, they -- they told me that before already.</p></p></dialogue>

So I, be-being very much interested in music, I was looking for some activity for something to do in connection with music. An-And I thought of becoming a cantor in the synagogue. There was a Jewish teacher's college in Berlin, and I asked a couple of my -- we had some acquaintances which were -- knew a lot about music and s -- and voice and singing and so on. So I consulted some of our friends, sang for them, and asked them if -- if they thought my voice was good enough to be a cantor. So I finally heard of s -- of the Jewish teacher's college in Berlin. And -- so, in other words, I would have to be trained as a cantor and as a teacher, mainly as a teacher, of course. This was a teacher's college, which specialized, of course, in Jewish education and public school and everything like this. So I applied for that and I was accepted and started in -- in spring 1936, and I was there for three years in Berlin.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Now, if she -- if she felt bad about it, she didn't let me know.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: My question is, did you f-feel like you had to be the man in the family because there was no man there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, actually not. At that time I was too young for that, at 12 years. I didn't feel I had any responsibility in that respect. But there were my uncles of -- there were two uncles of mine living in Fiirth, too, who of course w -- tried to help my mother manage things and so on.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So now you go off to Berlin, an-and what was your experience there at this teacher's college?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was very hard for me in the beginning because I felt very lonesome. I didn't know a soul in Berlin, and -- but that's -- got slowly used to it and I did pretty well in school there. I had some voice teachers, too. One was one of the best known cantors in Berlin. The other one was an opera singer at the Berlin opera. And they gi -- first one, then the other one gave me singing lessons, so I improved my voice to a certain extent.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And their names? The cantor's name and the singer's name?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The cantor's name was Davidson and the -- the opera singer's name was Relane Goodman. He was pretty well known.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And so you -- you were with all other Jewish students at the time, because this was a Jewish college.</p></p></dialogue>

A Jewish teacher's college. Half of it consisted of regular teacher's cl-classes and teaching. The other half was Jewish education because we had to teach religion, too.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I imagine you saw many swastikas and many flags hanging, not only in Fiirth, but of course in Berlin. How did that make you feel, to see them?</p></p></dialogue>

After awhile it didn't bother you too much any more.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Any experiences on the street when you were in Berlin, if you were walking down the street? Did you look very Jewish?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, I -- I looked Jewish, of course. But in -- in the big city of four million, you di-disappeared in the crowd. And you could do in -- in certain ways it was even better in Berlin than in Fiirth, because you could go to the places here still. In Fiirth you couldn't even go to a swimming pool, or in -- all the -- in -- in the rest of Germany you couldn't go to a swimming pool, to theaters or movies or any place like this. In fir -- in Berlin you could do that, because you just disappeared in the crowd. You could even go to the opera and to concerts. So in that respect, life in Berlin was easier than in Fiirth.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And how much communication did you have with your mother and your sister?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That -- it seems they managed all right without me, but business got worse at that point. Th-The longer Hitler was at pow -- in power, the worse economic conditions for Jews became.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you have to pay tuition to go to this college?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [had no special experiences in t -- I mean, they were -- I was pr -- became pretty close to the family, which made it easy for me to be alone in Berlin.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You had previously mentioned the Nuremberg rallies. Did you ever go to any of them, or hear them from a distance?</p></p></dialogue>

It never entered our minds to a -- to attend these things. You stayed away from -- from the -- these Nazi hordes as -- as much as you possibly could.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Any close Jewish friends that you could talk things over with?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did your family have any contacts in the -- in the United States at that time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My mother had a cousin in -- in America, in -- in York, Pennsylvania. He was a fairly wealthy man and he had vouched for quite a few people already to come to America, but when we asked him he couldn't do it any more. He must have vouched for maybe 20 people, and when you reach a certain point, you couldn't do it any more. So he had to say no to us in the beginning, but later on, for some reason he could do it again, and he asked -- he asked our family if they -- who -- who should -- he could vouch for one more person, who should come. And because I was the only man in the family and more in danger of being persecuted by the Nazis, so my family agreed to send -- to let me go.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: We-We'll get to that in a moment. You heard about the anschluss into -- into Austria, and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- what did that mean to you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It didn't mean much to me except I didn't -- we didn't like the idea that something like this could happen. We -- we thought ma -- there mi -- m-more  <span class="page-break" number="20"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Fred Goldman 4 November 19, 2001 countries might -- might be occupied by Germany, which actually happened later on. We saw this the beginning of something very bad.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Is that when you realized that what was happening may not be temporary?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was the time when -- when most Jews realized that things would not get any -- an-any better any more. Before we always thought Hitler's regime might stop any moment it ca -- when it came to a certain point, and it would not get worse. At that time we realized we couldn't stay. That's when people -- many people really started looking to get out seriously. Many, of course, had left already in 1933, but these were the Jews who lived in very small towns, in villages, mostly in south Germany and they were worse off than the Jews who lived in b -- in the big cities, because everybody knew everybody and people were beaten up and sent to concentration camps in these small place, much more than b -- in big cities, at that time. But after this happened at the anschluss and later on Kristallnacht, we came to the conclusion that there was no way of staying here.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was your experience during Kristallnacht?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In the middle of the night we heard a lot of noise, at maybe two, three o'clock in the morning, and the bra -- the breaking of glass. And then we looked out of the window, we saw that storm troopers marched all over the place and knocked in store windows and went inside and then they came -- they went upstairs out -- in these houses an-a-and arrested all the Jewish people. An -- and that -- that happened with  <span class="page-break" number="21"></span> Interview with Fred Goldman 8 November 19, 2001</p><p> each and every Jew in the whole place, and happened all over Germany. And then they -- they burned all synagogues. And I knew it -- I could see that our synagogue in Fiirth was burning at the time, too.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you in Berlin or Fiirth during Kristallnacht?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I -- I was still in Firth at that time. No, that was after I came back.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: This is November 1938.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was back in Fiirth already, th -- after my three years in Berlin when the kr -- Kristallnacht was November 9", 1938, and th-th-they t -- they took us all to a large square in the middle of the city and we had to stand there for five hours, men, women, children, everybody. Then they let women and children go home. The men were taken to a big hall, which had been donated by a Jew, by the way. And we spent all day in there. And they took men, took them up to the stage an-and beat them. And we had to watch it, we were sitting underneath, i-inside the hall and we had to watch everything. And that went on all day like this. And in the evening, about six, seven o'clock, we all had to pass a certain table, and we were -- there th- th-they decided what to do with us. So the majority of the men were sent to concentration camps, and to prisons. My -- my future father-in-law, for instance, was sent to pri -- was taken to prison and many other men were taken to concentration camps. And when I -- when I passed the table, they heard that I -- that I was almost ready to emigrate, my papers were almost ready. And they -- on</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="22"></span> Interview with Fred Goldman deg November 19, 2001</p><p> account of that they let me go. I was very lucky, cause I was able to go home. But the majority of the people did not. It's --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm. Le -- le-let's back up a little bit. You went to the teacher's college in Berlin for three years?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right, yes, for three years.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And that -- and then you completed the course, and then what happened?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Then I wa -- I was trying to find a job as a cantor teacher and I -- I had two auditions, I was in two cities in Germany. And in one place they didn't take me because I was t -- they found me too young, they wanted some -- somebody who -- who was a little older. And in the -- in the second case I don't know, they d-didn't accept me. So I went home, then I realized that it -- it was better for me not to accept a job, and try -- rather, try to -- to speed up my emigration. And that was a good thing, because I know some of the others who accepted jobs as teachers never got out of Germany. In that respect I was lucky.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And who did you work through to get the papers? You said you had that relative who had already completed the 20 affidavits -- i-in the United States, you said you had a relative who had sponsored 20 people, it -- did you work through him also?</p></p></dialogue>

An-And then I tri -- I tried to get -- the-they wanted a certain document, which sort of -- many -- in Germany when you moved, and thi -- it went for anybody, if you moved from one city or town to another one, you had to get permission by police. And that wa -- didn't go only for Jewish people, for everybody as th -- might still be the same nowadays, I don't know. So, and they told me I needed a certain paper, a declaration that I didn't owe any money to anybody or the taxes [indecipherable]. And I wrote to Berlin because I had been there before, a-and they -- I didn't get an answer. So my da -- emigration depended on -- on this document. And I wrote three times and never got an answer, so I decided I had to go there in person. So I made a trip to Berlin and I had to go to the Gestapo building, which everybody dreaded at the time. Nobody wanted to go there. So I went in, I -- I -- I met a -- an official there, and he yelled at me right away, he said, what's the matter with you, are you crazy?</p><p>You're writing three letters to me? Do you think we have nothing better to do than that? I feel like sending you to a concentration camp. And -- and then he said a few more words I forgot, and then he let me go.

And first of all I tried to find a job as a cantor. I never expected to get a job as teacher because of my heavy German accent, so I never expected to find that. But as a cantor I had some hope. But it just happened that at that time all the European cantors arrived in New York City in those years, and then there was a lot of competition. And I -- I auditioned in a couple of places, in a couple of synagogues, but I guess the competition was too strong. So then I looked for any kind of a job, and I -- I found job in a department store as a -- as a busboy. That's Klein Union Square, that was a pretty well known place in New York. There were many other refugees working there too, and I had to do the basic things, I had to pick up dre-dresses which fell down to the floor by the hundreds, and brought -- did stock work and all that.</p><p>End of Tape One, Side B  <span class="page-break" number="35"></span>  Interview with Fred Goldman *deg November 19, 2001 Beginning Tape Two, Side A</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Fred Goldman.

They found out that I speak -- they finally noticed that I speak German and I ba -- I became a member of military intelligence. I -- I went to fort -- to a camp in -- in Maryland, near Hagerstown, Camp Ritchie, which was a t -- a training camp for military intelligence, not only for German speaking, but for other languages too. And I -- I -- I went to school there for a couple of months. I was promoted from private to staff sergeant after I -- when I graduate from the -- from there.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was difficult, but I -- I was al -- always hoping to -- to be able to go home every couple of weeks you know, and -- and to furlough a -- a day off. And I was sent to -- first I was -- but that was before I was in military intelligence, I was in th -- in the -- in a camp right outside New York City. I'm just trying to remember the name of that. It was ha -- Halloran Hospital on Staten Island. And they needed me there because they had a lot of German prisoners, and I had to work as an interrogat -- as a interpreter and I had to go around with nurses and doctors, had to make the rounds when they saw the patients.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Who were the patients? Who were these patients?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They were German prisoners from Africa. They were members of the Africa corps.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not at this point but later on when I was in military intelligence, I was advised to change my name because my family was still supposed to be alive, or at least I did not know any different.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So where were you in -- in Germany? Where were you stationed?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was all over Germany, we -- I -- I came from France, from Alsace. We crossed the Rhine and then we went to south Germany, but that was in the -- near the end of the war. As a matter of fact we came to the point when interrogations of prisoners were -- was not even necessary any more. They cou -- they could not -- they didn't need any more interrogations. It was -- it was nearing the end and everything moved so fast that it wasn't necessary to get information from them. So they used me for different purposes. I was -- became a member of a task force, we had to interrogate pri -- civilians about certain -- about Nazis, big Nazis. Where they were located and -- and factories where -- where they manufactured war materials, where they were trying to -- to build an A bomb and things like that. They were all secret targets which we had to visit. So we -- we tr -- we traveled around in teams of six each and o-of course I had to interpret for y -- for the officers who -- who -- who questioned these people. Oh, I did some of -- some of my own interrogating, too.</p><p>And we found it -- some important places.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And then you would relay this message to your superiors?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, I did, yes. I wrote reports of what we saw and what we found.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember where these places were, where they worked on these?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I don't know -- remember any spe -- any particular places. Then a -- then I -- I wound up in a -- in a camp near Frankfurt where a lot of -- that was at the -- a- after the end of the war already, when -- where they kept a lot of high German officials and officers, generals and admirals and so on, near ha -- near Hamburg.</p><p>And then they put me on -- then I had to work on documents di -- di -- that was already in preparation for the war crime trials in Nuremberg later on. So I wrote for a couple of weeks on documents as I had to find out which documents they might be able to use, which might be important to them. So I -- I had to -- to ma -- make decisions what might be necessary for the war crime trials and whatnot. That was very interesting work and I liked that. I had a couple of people working under me who did the same work and a -- I was in charge of that.</p></p></dialogue>

They actually belonged to the big concentration camps, they were branches. And they were small camps, strictly for -- for forced labor, and some of them were all Jewish.</p><p>So | -- in -- in two cases I was the first Jewish American soldier who -- who entered them. And they were very happy to see me. I tol -- I told them of course that I was Jewish.

It was the main reason why I did this.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Why is that important?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think it's very important that they know what happened to me. In a way I felt it was my duty to let them know about my past.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you feel that you would be a different person if you hadn't gone through the experiences that you did? Did those experiences shape you? Your experience under Nazism, having to leave your family, start a new life? If you hadn't had to go through that, do you think you would have been a different person today?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, I think so. I'm almost sure that I -- my -- my life was shaped by -- by what happened to me, and my experiences and what I saw in my life. It must have had a bi -- a big influence on my -- on my life.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In what way?</p></p></dialogue>

Would not have happened.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did it make you more fearful?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In the beginning, yes. It did make me more fearful. When we ca -- when I came here, and my wife told me the same -- that happened to many German refugees who came at that time, we didn't even speak loud. We were -- were not used to speaking th -- in the normal way. We whispered. And th -- and this went on for quite awhile and it took me a long time and I'm sure it must have happened to others, too.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Because you didn't want other people to hear you speaking German, is that it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, because we were always afraid in Germany to speak loud, that Nazis didn't hear what we were talking -- saying to each other. So we got used to s -- to speaking very softly. Now one thing I would like to tell you in that respect. My daughter complained to us when she was an adult already that she -- she was influenced very much by our behavior. She -- she -- she must have felt how sad we were and she feels that this influenced her life very much so. And later on we asked our son i-if he had the same experience and he said no, because this was already six years later and he was not so mu -- we were not as much influenced by our past any more six years later, than she was.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And how did that affect her?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And how did you explain to your children that they had no extended relatives?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They know -- they know why. They never -- they never knew what it means to have a -- a grandparent, for instance.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How old were they when you explained what really happened to them?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Certainly not -- not too early. They must have been in their teens by that time, or maybe a little earlier when we told them all that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And how did they take that knowledge?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They took it as a matter of fact. I mean, they -- they took it as a fact. They met some other people, the -- older people who took the place of their grandparents.</p><p>They became grandparent figures for them, and they almost considered them as grandparents.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were these other German refugees?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, they were, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So when you and your wife were starting out in life together, were your friends other German refugees, or Americans? Who did you s-spend your time with?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: They were mostly -- they were mostly German refugees too, in our earlier years.</p><p>Later on of course, this was different.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm. Are there any sights today or sounds today that you hear or you see that trigger memories of Nazi Germany?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, there are. You -- you -- you see movies, for instance, of that area. Confer -- con -- like, you know, wh-where concentration camps were pictured, and ...there are all kinds of things which remind you. Sometimes books you read, magazines you see. My wife seems to be more sensitive to this than I am. My wife would never go back to Germany, for instance. Many other refugees have been invited to go back to their hometowns by -- by the -- by the city governments of these places, and many did go back, and my wife would never go back. I am not too tempted to go back either, but I'm not as strict about this as my wife is. I feel this -- it's three generations later and I don't think you can blame the present generation for the sins of their grandparents. And working -- working in the Holocaust Museum, I see a lot of magazine -- magazines of present Germany and I -- and I see that they -- they have changed.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: D-D-Do you -- would you go back to Fiirth if they invited you back?</p></p></dialogue>

I-I know what -- n-not from your wife's point of view, but your point of view.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [indecipherable] There's still -- still too many bad memories from that time, and especially if I see the older generations, my own generation, I would hate to see them when I go back to Germany. I have nothing against the young ones, but the older ones I don't want to meet again.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you have any close non-Jewish friends when you were growing up, and how would you feel if you met them now?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [had a ver -- very good friend, a Christian friend who went to school with me, graduated with me and everything. He became an -- a -- a doctor and he became a member of the armed -- German armed forces and he was in Russia all the time as a doctor, a German army doctor. And I -- I met him when I -- when I went back to visit my brother-in-law and I kept up my -- th -- my friendship with him. And he -- I really believe he was never a Nazi. As a matter of fact, near the end of my -- when -- of the time when I was in Germany, he made -- he made it a point to walk with me and -- through the streets in Fiirth, to be seen with me. So I kept on corresponding with him until he died of -- a couple of years ago. There were exceptions, of course, not all ba -- not all Germans were bad. I'm the last one to believe that.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, it doesn't, it does not make me angry, but it -- it frustrates me sometimes that American Jews don't seem to understand what we went through and went through the experiences, and many of them are not even interested in it. | wouldn't say the majority does that, but there are -- I've -- I've -- I've run into a number of them who don't abs -- absolutely understand what Nazism meant at that time, what it did to the Jews. Of course they -- they -- they couldn't know. You have to experience it yourself, otherwise you -- they just don't know.

Having known what went on, and what the circumstances were, this is sheer nonsense, was completely impossible. If I had done that, if I had shot a -- a -- a German that time, they -- they wo -- they -- fi -- 10 minutes later they would have killed a thousand others -- sa -- a thousand Jews. So I couldn't understand that a well educated and informed man like him could even think of that. That was not understandable to me.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [heard about it right away when I came to -- no, when I came here there was no Holocaust Museum yet. I was looking for some volunteer work I could do, and I couldn't think of nothing -- I could think of nothing better than the Holocaust Museum.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you -- you -- you started working with them after the building was built?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, right. I must have started f-four years ago. Four to five years ago. And do you know what I'm doing? I'm do -- making translations.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. I'm translating German documents. Not only documents, collections of letters, all kinds of p-political, military docum -- whatever. Whatever they give me to translate. I'm surprised that now, after 60 years almost after the end of the war, that they are still -- there's still more available. I expected three years ago that they wouldn't have any more work for me, but it seems they do. They get a lot of collections now. Letter collections. Letters which people wrote to their relatives.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="68"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Fred Goldman " November 19, 2001 People who were left behind in Germany and their children were in a -- in foreign countries already.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And how do you keep yourself going when you read -- when you translate these things, it's -- is it painful?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I-In many cases it's pai -- it is painful. There are many nights when I cannot fall asleep. It's not always easy to -- to work on this, especially when I've run into cases which are similar to my own family's fate. Concentration camps and so on.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Now, I have a -- I-I understand many -- many things better, how people -- how people felt about certain situations, especially in these collections of letters. Ma -- for instance, parents whose children left Germany and they -- and the parents were still caught up in germ -- caught in Germany. And I could understand very well how these -- how the parents felt, first about not being able to get out any more.</p><p>Number two about feeling left behind.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you are translating these German letters from both the children and the parents?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right. About their attempts to -- to get out of Germany, and so -- in many cases when they were -- they knew already they would not be able to get out.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you bring work home with you or only work at the museum?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I wanted to take things home, but I'm -- we are not allowed to do that. We are not al-allowed to take any documents home.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, Id -- I do. I tried a couple of times t-to persuade people to work in the Holocaust Museum. But I don't think so far I've been successful.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What do you -- what reasons do you give them?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: It's ver-very interesting work, and -- and that they'd learn a lot about -- about th - - about the Judaism by doing this kind of work.</p><p>End of Tape Two, Side B  <span class="page-break" number="71"></span>  Interview with Fred Goldman deg November 19, 2001 Beginning Tape Three, Side A</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Fred Goldman. This is tape number three, side A. And we were talking about your work as a volunteer at the museum and -- and why you do it and the lessons that have been learned. Is there anything else you want to add to that?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Lessons which I've learned by working in the Holocaust Museum?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was very happy to see that so many people, looking at the nu -- large numbers of volunteers there, very happy to see that people are interested in it. People who -- who do not come from Europe, who are -- maybe less motive -- must be less motivated than I am, but that still a lot of people have interest in this kind of work.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What -- what is your relationship with the other volunteers who are survivors or witnesses to the Holocaust? Do you have a special relationship with them?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I don't think I have a special relationship with them. I meet a lot of them, I am a member of the survivor's group, and that's when I -- when I meet them sometimes wa -- once a month. And I'm very happy to see there are so many in this group. I never considered myself a survivor, not having been in the concentration camp. Originally I thought survivors are only people who went through a concentration camp and are survivors of concentration camps. But I am not, and the  <span class="page-break" number="72"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Fred Goldman deg November 19, 2001 -- I see there are many others on the same position. But it seems we are -- we are considered survivors in -- like in my case having lived in -- in Nazi Germany for six years.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right, yes, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Wha-What is your relationship to the volunteers at the museum who are not from Europe, who are not survivors and refugees?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The same thing. The same relationship as with these sur-sur-survivors. Very friendly with quite a number of them. And I'd like to meet them, I'm looking forward to -- to every session there, every week when I go there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What do you feel like when you walk into the building? Do you feel like this is a part of you? What -- what -- what are your thoughts when you put your foot over the threshold?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, it's a very important part of my life by now. I -- I feel that I'm do -- doing important work and I -- for that reason I'm looking forward to going there every week.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: As opposed to walking into another government building, let's say, why is that building different than another Federal building?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Because it has a lot more meaning to me than other government buildings.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="73"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Fred Goldman " November 19, 2001</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: What -- what kind of meaning? What kind of meaning does it have to you, does that building represent to you?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I feel it -- it -- it's very important to me. More important to a -- to other government buildings, because of my fate and of what's happened to me. And because I'm becoming more and more convinced that it's very important to ha -- to - - to have the Holocaust Museum. I'm surprised to see there's a -- so many non-Jews are going there. To me it looks bi -- looking around, I have the feeling that 80 to 85 percent of the people who come there are non-Jews, and I'm very happy to see that they seem to be interested. Of course, they don't come all -- they don't all come on their own account, they come besa -- because they're being sent by I don't know whom.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Is it appropriate that there is this building in the United States, in Washington?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Definitely. It's very important. They should have more Holocaust museums in the rest of the country. There should be more -- more of them. Like in new yor -- in New York City, they -- they have some kind of a Holocaust museum, but it -- it's not what this one is. Th -- like th-the new one they have in New York is only -- only part of it is Holocaust museum, the rest is jew -- Jewish museum. I understand only one floor there is u -- being used for that purpose, right?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Have you been to Yad Vashem in is -- in Israel?</p></p></dialogue>

And I was very impressed by there, too. But of course, the Washington mem -- memorial hol -- Holocaust Museum is better for the purpose it is supposed to be. It's a -- it's more technically advanced, whatever they show, than what I saw that time in Yad Vashem. So people must be more impressed with what they see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Have you had any very powerful experiences or memorable experiences when you're working there? You did mention how when you read letters from people who were left behind that that was very touching. Any other memorable experiences you can talk about?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I don't think so. I know many people -- many other people did, but I can not remember of any case that I was especially impressed by something.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Are -- is there -- are there any particular parts of the museum, or the exhibits with which you identify, when you've gone through the exhibit? Do you see anything that really touches you personally?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You're talking about the tiles, the room with the tiles?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The tiles, right, yes. They impress me very much and I go there very often to look at these tiles. Some of them are excellent of these tiles. They tell you a lot. It also shows how children, espe -- especially children react to these events.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: In the permanent exhibit, wa -- in the beginning when it shows life in Germany and then the increasing restrictions that were imposed on the Jews -- do you know what I mean, in the -- on the top floor, on the fourth floor, when you read this, does it bring it all back to you, what you lived through in the 30's?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah, it certainly brings everything back to me. I had the same experiences. But of course, in my case it's a long time. That was 60 years ago or more, so maybe these impressions were not too strong i-in me any more. But now, of course, this -- this all reminds me very much of what's happened.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you feel as you've gotten older and for -- farther removed in time, it does make a difference?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. It certainly brings it back much -- much better. When I see these things I -- I notice that I had forgotten many things which happened that time to me and to th -- to the other Jewish people and which slowly diminished in my -- in my memory.</p><p>This brings it back again, very much.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah, I did have to sha -- like everybody else. I still have it in my old passport when I -- when I left Germany.

I considered it more as a nuisance, I think, at the time when it happened. Seeing -- with all the other things hap -- happening to us, that was only a small part. Comparively -- a small nuisance compared to many other things which happened which were much worse at that time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did your sister take to adding Sarah to her name?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you receive reparations from Germany?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, I do. I got restitution for a number of things. For the loss -- for the loss of our house, our business and i-interruption of our education. But it was -- it -- it didn't amount to much money. And for many things I didn't get anything at all. For instance, the value of our -- our stock in th -- in our business, you know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did it take a long time to receive it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes, it was very difficult, very hard. It had something to do with the fact that our -- my lawyer was not very efficient, I think. He was -- I guess he was too old at the time. For every letter I -- I wrote, I had to wait -- wait a long [indecipherable] sometimes I had to write three or four times to get a answer -- an answer from him.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="77"></span> ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion Interview with Fred Goldman ia November 19, 2001</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Thi-This was the lawyer in Germany?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, it was a Jewish lawyer.
