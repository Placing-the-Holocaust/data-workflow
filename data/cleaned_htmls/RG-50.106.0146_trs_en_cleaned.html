I loved to play soccer. Later, when Hitler came to power, all Jewish kids joined -- th-th-they founded Jewish sports clubs because we were not allowed to be members of others. So that was also a social outlet for all Jewish kids. So I was very active there. F-F-Field and track, and soccer I played and I was -- I wa -- I was one of the socc -- soccer players on my team and we traveled every Sunday to -- to towns nearby and played games there. I was very active as far as sports are concerned. And I was the -- one of the best athletes in si -- in high school, too.

Did you have any ideas about a future career?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, I was not -- because the situation changed all the time. When the rights were taken away from all Jews, I -- you had less possibilities and chances t-to go to certain schools and universities. As a matter of fact, shortly after Hitler came to power, Jews could not go to colleges any more, and universities. So I had to change my professional plans all the time.</p><p>This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. What is -- okay, so it i -- you were 18 years old -- or 17 and a half when he came into power.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What is your first recollection of Hitler?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My first recollection of Hitler is shortly after he came to power, there was a boycott of all Jewish stores, all over Germany. That me -- it meant that storm troopers stood in front of -- a couple of storm troopers stood in front of all Jewish stores and stopped people from going in. The -- well, that lasted only a couple of days and then they discontinued that, but it made a deep impression on me that time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, when he came into power, you were still in the gymnasium?</p></p></dialogue>

So that was one reason why we all thought it might end very suddenly again. We thought it couldn't last, that Hitler would be thrown out again, and we thought it only for a short while. We couldn't believe that this would stay forever.</p><p>But later on of course, it got more serious.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In the beginning, did you talk things over with your parents about the changes when Hitler came into power? Were they open with you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yes. These were the only people you could talk with about things like them.</p><p>We were always very careful to make remarks about Hitler in the Nazi time, so I spoke only to my -- mainly to my family about this. Actually, my father was not alive any more when Hitler came to power. My father died in 1927.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Wh-What did he die from?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: In the beginning there was hardly any change in 1933, but 30 -- "34, and shortly after that, it slowly changed. In the beginning I was still very friendly with all of -- we were a Class of 25, who stayed together by the way, until the nine years were over, SO we -- we were always together. So I was still very friendly with most -- almost all of them. And then --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: This is boys and girls?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, boys and girls, right. And they kept on talking to me, we had friendly relations, but slowly they all joined the Hitler youth, the Nazi organization. And they didn't stop talking to me, but they were -- they were still more distant. And slowly this changed too, for the worse.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What about your teachers?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: My teachers behaved all right. They didn't show any anti-Semitism, even actually up to the end when -- when I left. When I -- when I -- when high school was over. But I was banned from certain activities in school. When they were in nationalistic celebrations or national holidays, in -- in which I always had taken part of before, we were banned from these thing -- I was banned from there, which I actually didn't mind.

So I, be-being very much interested in music, I was looking for some activity for something to do in connection with music. An-And I thought of becoming a cantor in the synagogue. There was a Jewish teacher's college in Berlin, and I asked a couple of my -- we had some acquaintances which were -- knew a lot about music and s -- and voice and singing and so on. So I consulted some of our friends, sang for them, and asked them if -- if they thought my voice was good enough to be a cantor. So I finally heard of s -- of the Jewish teacher's college in Berlin. And -- so, in other words, I would have to be trained as a cantor and as a teacher, mainly as a teacher, of course. This was a teacher's college, which specialized, of course, in Jewish education and public school and everything like this. So I applied for that and I was accepted and started in -- in spring 1936, and I was there for three years in Berlin.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, actually not. At that time I was too young for that, at 12 years. I didn't feel I had any responsibility in that respect.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was very hard for me in the beginning because I felt very lonesome. I didn't know a soul in Berlin, and -- but that's -- got slowly used to it and I did pretty well in school there. I had some voice teachers, too. One was one of the best known cantors in Berlin. The other one was an opera singer at the Berlin opera. And they gi -- first one, then the other one gave me singing lessons, so I improved my voice to a certain extent.</p></p></dialogue>

A Jewish teacher's college. Half of it consisted of regular teacher's cl-classes and teaching. The other half was Jewish education because we had to teach religion, too.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Any experiences on the street when you were in Berlin, if you were walking down the street? Did you look very Jewish?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, I -- I looked Jewish, of course. But in -- in the big city of four million, you di-disappeared in the crowd. And you could do in -- in certain ways it was even better in Berlin than in Fiirth, because you could go to the places here still. In Fiirth you couldn't even go to a swimming pool, or in -- all the -- in -- in the rest of Germany you couldn't go to a swimming pool, to theaters or movies or any place like this. In fir -- in Berlin you could do that, because you just disappeared in the crowd. You could even go to the opera and to concerts. So in that respect, life in Berlin was easier than in Fiirth.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My mother had a cousin in -- in America, in -- in York, Pennsylvania. He was a fairly wealthy man and he had vouched for quite a few people already to come to America, but when we asked him he couldn't do it any more. He must have vouched for maybe 20 people, and when you reach a certain point, you couldn't do it any more. So he had to say no to us in the beginning, but later on, for some reason he could do it again, and he asked -- he asked our family if they -- who -- who should -- he could vouch for one more person, who should come. And because I was the only man in the family and more in danger of being persecuted by the Nazis, so my family agreed to send -- to let me go.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Is that when you realized that what was happening may not be temporary?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was the time when -- when most Jews realized that things would not get any -- an-any better any more. Before we always thought Hitler's regime might stop any moment it ca -- when it came to a certain point, and it would not get worse. At that time we realized we couldn't stay. That's when people -- many people really started looking to get out seriously. Many, of course, had left already in 1933, but these were the Jews who lived in very small towns, in villages, mostly in south Germany and they were worse off than the Jews who lived in b -- in the big cities, because everybody knew everybody and people were beaten up and sent to concentration camps in these small place, much more than b -- in big cities, at that time. But after this happened at the anschluss and later on Kristallnacht, we came to the conclusion that there was no way of staying here.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was back in Fiirth already, th -- after my three years in Berlin when the kr -- Kristallnacht was November 9", 1938, and th-th-they t -- they took us all to a large square in the middle of the city and we had to stand there for five hours, men, women, children, everybody. Then they let women and children go home. The men were taken to a big hall, which had been donated by a Jew, by the way. And we spent all day in there. And they took men, took them up to the stage an-and beat them. And we had to watch it, we were sitting underneath, i-inside the hall and we had to watch everything. And that went on all day like this. And in the evening, about six, seven o'clock, we all had to pass a certain table, and we were -- there th- th-they decided what to do with us. So the majority of the men were sent to concentration camps, and to prisons.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And that -- and then you completed the course, and then what happened?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Then I wa -- I was trying to find a job as a cantor teacher and I -- I had two auditions, I was in two cities in Germany. And in one place they didn't take me because I was t -- they found me too young, they wanted some -- somebody who -- who was a little older. And in the -- in the second case I don't know, they d-didn't accept me. So I went home, then I realized that it -- it was better for me not to accept a job, and try -- rather, try to -- to speed up my emigration. And that was a good thing, because I know some of the others who accepted jobs as teachers never got out of Germany. In that respect I was lucky.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Why is that important?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think it's very important that they know what happened to me. In a way I felt it was my duty to let them know about my past.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you feel that you would be a different person if you hadn't gone through the experiences that you did?

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, I think so. I'm almost sure that I -- my -- my life was shaped by -- by what happened to me, and my experiences and what I saw in my life. It must have had a bi -- a big influence on my -- on my life.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did it make you more fearful?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In the beginning, yes. It did make me more fearful. When we ca -- when I came here, and my wife told me the same -- that happened to many German refugees who came at that time, we didn't even speak loud. We were -- were not used to speaking th -- in the normal way. We whispered. And th -- and this went on for quite awhile and it took me a long time and I'm sure it must have happened to others, too.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Because you didn't want other people to hear you speaking German, is that it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, because we were always afraid in Germany to speak loud, that Nazis didn't hear what we were talking -- saying to each other. So we got used to s -- to speaking very softly. Now one thing I would like to tell you in that respect. My daughter complained to us when she was an adult already that she -- she was influenced very much by our behavior. She -- she -- she must have felt how sad we were and she feels that this influenced her life very much so. And later on we asked our son i-if he had the same experience and he said no, because this was already six years later and he was not so mu -- we were not as much influenced by our past any more six years later, than she was.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And how did you explain to your children that they had no extended relatives?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They know -- they know why. They never -- they never knew what it means to have a -- a grandparent, for instance.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How old were they when you explained what really happened to them?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Certainly not -- not too early. They must have been in their teens by that time, or maybe a little earlier when we told them all that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And how did they take that knowledge?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They took it as a matter of fact. I mean, they -- they took it as a fact. They met some other people, the -- older people who took the place of their grandparents.</p><p>They became grandparent figures for them, and they almost considered them as grandparents.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were these other German refugees?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So when you and your wife were starting out in life together, were your friends other German refugees, or Americans? Who did you s-spend your time with?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm. Are there any sights today or sounds today that you hear or you see that trigger memories of Nazi Germany?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, there are. You -- you -- you see movies, for instance, of that area. Confer -- con -- like, you know, wh-where concentration camps were pictured, and ...there are all kinds of things which remind you. Sometimes books you read, magazines you see. My wife seems to be more sensitive to this than I am. My wife would never go back to Germany, for instance. Many other refugees have been invited to go back to their hometowns by -- by the -- by the city governments of these places, and many did go back, and my wife would never go back. I am not too tempted to go back either, but I'm not as strict about this as my wife is. I feel this -- it's three generations later and I don't think you can blame the present generation for the sins of their grandparents. And working -- working in the Holocaust Museum, I see a lot of magazine -- magazines of present Germany and I -- and I see that they -- they have changed.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you have any close non-Jewish friends when you were growing up, and how would you feel if you met them now?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [had a ver -- very good friend, a Christian friend who went to school with me, graduated with me and everything. He became an -- a -- a doctor and he became a member of the armed -- German armed forces and he was in Russia all the time as a doctor, a German army doctor. And I -- I met him when I -- when I went back to visit my brother-in-law and I kept up my -- th -- my friendship with him. And he -- I really believe he was never a Nazi. As a matter of fact, near the end of my -- when -- of the time when I was in Germany, he made -- he made it a point to walk with me and -- through the streets in Fiirth, to be seen with me. So I kept on corresponding with him until he died of -- a couple of years ago. There were exceptions, of course, not all ba -- not all Germans were bad. I'm the last one to believe that.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, it doesn't, it does not make me angry, but it -- it frustrates me sometimes that American Jews don't seem to understand what we went through and went through the experiences, and many of them are not even interested in it. | wouldn't say the majority does that, but there are -- I've -- I've -- I've run into a number of them who don't abs -- absolutely understand what Nazism meant at that time, what it did to the Jews.

To me it looks bi -- looking around, I have the feeling that 80 to 85 percent of the people who come there are non-Jews, and I'm very happy to see that they seem to be interested.
