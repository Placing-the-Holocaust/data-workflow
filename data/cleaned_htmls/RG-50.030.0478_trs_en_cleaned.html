<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Good morning, Mr. Krasa.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Good morning to you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: May I call you Edgar?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, sure.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes? What -- what name were you born with?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Edgar. And I always wondered where my German speaking mother came up with Edgar.</p><p>And she said it was between Raoul and Edgar, so I said, "I'm glad you picked Edgar."</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And your last name?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Krasa, K-r-a-s-a.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. And where and when were you born?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was born in the German part of Czechoslovakia, in Karlsbad, call it Sudeten, too. And my upbringing while we were there was in German language. Grade school started in German, and there was never any animosity among -- that I felt -- between the Czech and the German population, and these were German Nationalists, but Czech citizens, Czechoslovakian citizens. And there was no friction between the Germans and the Jews until I think in 1930, when Hitler came to power, he started to demand of the leaders of that German Nationals -- of those German Nationals, to start to agitate, and complain about oppression by the Czechoslovakian government, and it -- and demand to be annexed by the Nazis. And by 1933, it -- three years later, it came to the point where my father as a Jew couldn't make a living among those Germans. And he moved to Prague.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can I -- can I go back, so we can go just a little bit more slowly?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was the date of your birth?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: February ninth, 1924.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: 1924.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. And do you remember growing up -- you -- you moved to Prague in 1933 --</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Is that right? So do you remember growing up between 1924 and 1933 in --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I do remember.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- in Karlsbad?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My father was born 1877, one of nine children, the oldest of nine children, six boys, three girls. And I am so sorry that I never -- I didn't know his parents. But I never initiated questions about them, and he -- neither did he. So I don't know what -- we found out in the archives that his father was a -- had a small store in a -- in a very small town in central Bohemia. And -- so at age 16, he went to Vienna, to be able to earn some money, and he worked himself up to a tremendous position in a textile factory, to the point where he supported his brothers to go to school, and accumulate a dowry for his three sisters. So in World War I, he must have been acknowledged by the military as a good administrator, so he became administrator of a hospital in Karlsbad. And there he then later settled. My mother, you didn't ask about her, but I'll tell you anyway.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I was going to.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: She was born in -- in the German part of Czechoslovakia, and sh -- that family was religious. Not fanatically, but Saturday was no work, I couldn't go to the barber, have my hair cut on Saturday. I don't remember, I -- they must have been kosher, but the father's side, the Czech Jews, they were very assimilated. They were aware of being Jewish, and if they weren't aware th -- of, this would have made them aware. But the Czech -- Czechs were not antisimic -- not aggressively anti-Semitic. I think they handled the Jews in a way that they didn't know what they are, and how different they are from them, and kept them a little at arm's length. And some would be very nice to you, and then when you turned your back they would say, there goes the dirty Jew. This kind of hidden anti- Semitism. But I never -- I never suffered by it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Your mother was considerably younger than your father, am I right?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: 18 years younger, and how they met was that she was a born matchmaker, and she wanted him -- I don't know where she met him, she wanted him for a friend of hers. And we met that friend later, and we discovered why he didn't marry her, she was very dull.</p><p>And somehow -- he may have been attracted by a younger woman. I am too, but it's too late for me. And so they got married, and settled in Karlsbad. But what happened with this excellent job that my father had in Vienna, he saved a lot of money, which he lost when Austria lost the war. The money became devalued, and somehow he could not recover from that. He --</p></p></dialogue>

He continued to live in the way he lived while he had the money, to I think show in front of other people that he is -- is still up there. But he was very, very lower middle class I think I would say, to the point where Mother had to sublet rooms to earn some extra income. And then in 1933 we moved to Prague. He went first to look for a [indecipherable] for a jo -- for an apartment, for a job, and then in October, we moved to Prague.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Wh-What was your relationship like with your parents? Were you close with them?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Relationship was very good. I -- I started my memoirs by writing, I want this -- I'm writing this for my kids, not for -- for publishing, and thinking back of the relationship my parents, from what I heard, had with their parents, and what my parents had with me, and the relationship, and how I was bringing up my kids, and how they bringing up their kids, should they laugh, or should I cry? It was -- it was a respectful relationship. Mother was the boss. She was running the family and everybody else. And -- and she come and I wasn't there that minute, I had one coming like this.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: She hit you, really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And the second time I was there when she called. I know my sons call their kids 10 times, come, come, come. Then they give up and the kids don't come. If my wife is listening, she's going to kill me for this statement. So -- and I discussed this with one of our daughters-in-law, and she says, ""You cannot touch the kids, because they become abusive parents themselves." I didn't become abusive, and I didn't become abusive to anybody else, and I still loved my mother, and respected her. And I think it made me a -- a straight guy.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was she warm as we -- I mean, she could be strict, clearly, but was she also warm to you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: She was warm and witty, and -- and had many friends, and was liked by others.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you liked her, also?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And was your father, being so much older, was -- was --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We had very little -- very little activities together. He went to work, and in the afternoon he -- some of the people sat somewhere playing cards, he never did this. Me, what I did with my kids, skiing, swimming, running, sports, o-or other activities. He was 45 when he got married, and 47 when I was born, and at that time, 47, you were a settled person.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you eat dinners together?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you eat dinner together --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- did you eat all your meals together?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you were an only child?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Only child. That's why I'm so spoiled.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And did you have conversations at dinner, do you remember? As a little kid? Did they ask you questions, and -- about school, and your friends?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In -- opposite what's happening in England, we were not allowed to talk with a full mouth. So while you were eating, and you had the full mouth all the time, there was no conversation at the table.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Interesting. So it was very quiet.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. But I -- I did not have many toys. I had one -- what do you call this horse? Rocking horse --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Rocking hor --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- which also could -- you could take off this rocking part and then it was on wheels. And we lived on a street that had a slope, we -- I took the horse up, and -- and rolled down.</p><p>And I remember at one point one of the children wanted to have it, I don't know for what reason I wouldn't give it to him, my mother locked me up in the bathroom the whole afternoon as punishment because I was not generous enough. And when she had to go to the bathroom, she went to the neighbor's bathroom. Very strict, but still lovable.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And loving.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you -- did you understand when you were young, before you left for Prague, that your f -- your father -- you really didn't have a lot of money, but he was trying to behave as if he had money? I mean, did you understand that there was a f -- confusion?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. I found it out later from Mother.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: N-yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So did you have a maid?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We had a maid in the beginning, I remember, and that also had to -- that belonged to the status. We had to have one, and I remember one summer, she went home, her father picked her up with a horse drawn carriage and I went with them to spend some time there, but I don't know how long. It was a short -- and vacations, while we lived in Karlsbad, I spend with Mother's family in -- nearby, it was 60 kilometers from Karlsbad.</p><p>Her father had a liquor production, which her older brother took over, but her older brother was only a half brother from his -- from her father's first wife, who died. And then he remarried, and through the second wife he had four daughters.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And one was a divorced lady, so she can co -- she maintained the household for the older brother, whose wife died on diabetes. I remember her, she was a wonderful wife, but when I remember now what diet she kept, I don't wonder that she died early. I had only one grandmother, of Mother's -- from Mother's side, the father died already and she died when I was three years. And the only thing I remember, she always wore an apron. And the only sentence I remember that she said -- that I remember, was to my mother, "Don't beat the boy, he's such a wonderful child." So that means she started to punish me already before I was three years old. She d -- do it to make a good guy out of -- or a decent person out of me, I don't know, that was the method, maybe.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remem -- do you remember being hit a lot?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not a lot, no, not a lot, but I had to obey on the second.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And mainly she would slap you in the face?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And the only time Father was hitting me was when I was writing, he insisted on beautiful handwriting. He had two fingers on the right hand injured -- cut off, and in spite of it, his handwriting was like printing. And he didn't know that there will be typewriters, and dictating machines, and computers, so not only should I have a legible handwriting, but he said this is a show of character. So that was the thinking at that time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So how -- so how's your handwriting now, is it good?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Ah, ah, I can't -- I can't consider right now -- I -- I print well, I write legibly.</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Even my wife will dispute it, but I write legibly, but I don't -- I don't need it much.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right, right. Was it a surprise to you that you were going to move to Prague?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no, I understood that among the Germans the -- the political situation is not good, and that -- whether I knew it, it's because of financial, or economic reasons, or whether it is for political, I couldn't say now exactly what I knew, that we're moving because the Germans were not very good to the Jews.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And it was assumed that in Prague it would be better?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>

And seemed like an awful long morning, you know?</p><p>And interesting that during Yizkor, the prayers for the deceased, the kids were sent out, cause they didn't have anybody deceased there, I think. So we were playing outside, there was a -- a little wooded lawn area in front of the synagogue, and we were sent out, it was a break. But I never became very religious. I -- there is a feeling of God that she instilled in me, and when we get later to these various stages of the Holocaust, it varied in several degrees.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But you said your mother dragged you and your father to the synagogue.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In 1938, it came so far into th -- the pure remember or [indecipherable] with the help of Britain and France, the -- they supported the Germans, that the Czech government gives up that border area where the majority of German Nationals were. There was a -- a non- aggression agreement, France and England on this side of Germany, Czechoslovakia on this side, should any -- should one be attacked, the others would assist. And at that time, Chamberlain and Daladier decided -- I don't know whether decided, they thought if they give in this little bit to Hitler, they avoid World War IL. So not only was, in September deg38, this border area occupied by the Nazis, they also came beyond the Czech fortifications which they had on the border, against the Germans, so now they were standing there naked, without any fa -- without any safety, security or fortifications. So it was anticipated that Hitler's appetite will grow to the point where he will occupy also the Czech lands. And the parents of Jewish teenagers encouraged their kids to learn a trade, should immigration become necessary, they can support themselves with work of their hands in a country whose language they don't know. And then aunt of mine told my mother, "Why don't you have the boy become a cook, so he never has to go hungry?" There was no discussion of -- Mother agreed, so that that was it.</p></p></dialogue>

So I got exposed to bringing coal from the bay -- from the cellar, not only to the kitchen, but also to the third floor where his wife lived, where wi -- they lived, and taking down the ashes, and the -- whether they didn't have yet -- they must have had, but they didn't use them, vacuum cleaners, so I took the carpet down, and in the yard was a -- a beam, put the carpet over, and by hand you bang it, there was a -- I don't know whether you ever seen one, it's a big antique [indecipherable] now.

Anyway, so you had two carriages, and there were little poles -- but they were not poles like this, but they were like -- like a cup, a large cup, and I went to all these three offices, deliver the soups, just in time to come back at noon to wash the dishes, there were three tables in that -- opposite the counter where some workers, or people came and consumed their meal there. So just came back to wash the dishes, and then clean up the -- the kitchen and the floor, and the -- so that was my exposure.</p></p></dialogue>

Eat, eat, eat. So he gets -- he gets fed up with it, and then he eats very little, so he won't be too expensive by consuming a lot of food later. And this guy tried me on plum dumplings.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. I don't know how others decided.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- with a -- was a -- not a gun, but was something he had in the hand, he pushed the button and shot the cattle in the head. And it was not kosher, so I learned everything and I don't know -- now when I pick up a 30 - 35 pound luggage going to the airport, it seems very heavy. I was carrying whole quarters of beef to -- in the -- in town was a marketplace where in the basement, the whole basement was refrigerated. And because meat and beef was not as tender as we have here -- now here, beef is fed with corn, and in six months it's big enough to be slaughtered. So it means you have tender -- young, tender meat. There, it took much longer with grass and hay to feed the cattle, and -- so it had to age. It was hanging three weeks in that uniform temperature. And when you were able to scrape off the moss from the meat, it was the right age. And I was on a spiral staircase, I was carrying down whole quarters of beef, I don't know how I did that.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And -- okay, and then the next station was soup, with a soup chef, and then with a vegetable chef. And I remember for the soup, he was a young guy, but he was -- he was a nasty guy. But not because I was Jew, he was nasty to everybody. I had to cut for soup, so there were kettles where they were boiling all the bones, and all the meat that you cut off the ends, and what you didn't want on the portion to be served, and vegetable, and all the -- the peels of the onion, which gives good color to the soup. And as a filler for some soups, was a small dice of vegetable, carrots, celery, theirs was the root celery, and parsley and had to cut those in uniform dice by hand, and when I had about this much in a pot, he came and looked through it and if wasn't uniform, he threw it in the kettle, and I</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. So how long would you be at each station learning? When you learned soup --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: This I don't remember. Then the grill, and the roast, and then the -- well, braising, you know, because the meat was not as tender as this meat, and in spite of aging, for steaks, only the tenderloin and the sirloin was used. The other pieces were not suitable. So these were -- there's a goulash and butt roast, you know, braised with -- with gravy. So that was the station where I worked. And of course, not just the beef, there were pork and lamb and fish. Yeah, after the slaughterhouse, I was in the basement working with two butchers. They were from those quarters preparing a portion size, whether it was a roast, or whether it was steaks to be cut. I worked there before I got to the soups. And then the salad department, and then the pastry. And the pastry was a pastry chef, and a female helper, and she loved me. I was lucky with women. No, she was very nice, she covered up for my mistakes, and you know, we were making like a -- a sponge cake, but a little different, from 80 eggs. So if you spoil 80 eggs, it was -- labor was cheap that time, and food was expensive. Here it's different. So she was nice to me, and -- and on the salad I worked in, they were th -- the salad was not just salad, it was decorative items like fish in -- in aspic, and gelled, and -- a first class place. And -- yeah?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Huh. And as a -- at a certain point do you get a particular specialty that you work on more than others, or you keep working at each of these stations?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: First to learn, you move around, and then if the apprenticeship from the soup post was sick, so they took one [indecipherable] and you moved around, and you were able to substitute in every department. And there was no anti-Semitism. All the time -- in "41, the owner -- there were two owners, one was more looking at the kitchen, the other one was looking at the other areas. And he was very nice, and he came and said he's under great pressure to let me go, and he didn't expl -- didn't have to explain to me why, I knew. And at that time I couldn't get a job any more in another restaurant. Now, we were at ni -- it's deg41, you pushed me too far ahead.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When does occupation happen?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: March 15", 1935 -- deg39. And immediately thereafter they started to apply the -- what they call the Jewish laws, which were actually anti-Jewish laws. I think you have knowledge about them -- about those --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell me -- tell me what you remember.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The first thing was to identify the Jews, although they ar -- physically identify, and physically and visibly identify, because they had at the police records they had all the Jews, because at the time you had to give your religion -- I don't know for whatever purpose, but to -- at the police station your registration was your religion known. So the first thing came this yellow star to wear. And you had to wear it on every piece of outwear, so if you took your jacket off, you had to have one on your shirt. And then, turning in all the valuables, including wedding rings, which I guess the Germans used to finance their war efforts. Then a radio, so you can't listen to BBC. Everything was dual intent, for the Germans to enrich themselves with those items, and the second purpose was to deprive the Jews of whatever gave them pleasure or resistance. So the radios, so you couldn't listen to BBC, and then musical instruments had to be turned in. And then came restrictions to travel, you couldn't go out, get out of your town. [indecipherable] You could not enter public areas like movies, theaters or parks, playgrounds. And Jews could travel in the streetcar only in the last car, on the last platform standing. And there were many more -- oh, ration tickets were issued. There were three kinds of -- for the Germans, they were -- we were already somewhat restricted because was a war economy.</p><p>The Czechs got less, and the Jews got almost a blank paper. And if you were caught with something that you could not have -- that was not on those tickets, it was -- this was punishable. So my parents had my food ration ticket, because I ate at the restaurant. And they get -- had 50 percent more of almost nothing, that's -- how much that is, I don't know. Mathematician has to figure that out. But they were better off than some other people.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Food ration tick -- yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- food ra -- yes, which was 50 percent of nothing, right? But let me -- let me -- let me go back before we go forward a little bit. Do you remember the day that the Germans marched in to Prague?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, I was standing in the sidewalk in my cook's uniform, horrified to see them. They -- that restaurant was on the main --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- through road in Prague, and that -- approaching through there. Everybody was -- people were crying, and --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So the Czech -- the Czechs were not like the Austrians?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, definitely not, but there were some who very soon adapted themselves to raising the arm, and -- yeah, you know, I think the Czechs had the -- I don't want to sound im -- missing the right word, but it doesn't matter. They were not deeply involved in anything spiritual, I mean, they were 400 years under the Austrians, under the Hapsburgs before World War I, then for 20 years -- and they tolerated it and cooperated, and they had to live -- make a living. Then for 20 years they were free, from eight -- 1918 till ?38, and there were great Czech patriots. And when the Germans occupied, many became sympathizers, and collaborants -- collaborators. Then there were again great Czechs after deg45. There were fighters for Czech freedom 10 minutes before the war ended, and -- not 10 minutes, two days. And then the Communists took over, they became the great Communists. And in 1989, the biggest Communists, who were Etta Truff, and -- made all the money and stole all the money, they were the ones, the first ones who privatized state enterprises. And with their Communist connections, they got it for almost nothing, and today they're millionaires. So they can adjust in the [indecipherable] so, any condition.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I didn't know the full future impact of -- you know, the Germans now occupied the Czech lands, that -- that I knew is -- isn't good. But the full range of impact on the Jews, I did not know, I didn't -- I knew that Jews in Germany are persecuted and all that, but it somehow didn't sink in immediately, I am in danger.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, yeah.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In Karlsbad he was a salesman for textile because that's what he knew from Vienna, from before. And I guess he couldn't find anything in that line in Prague. So once a salesman, always a salesman, he started to sell coal. And I don't know whether to individual home owners because the truck came and every house had a -- a cellar, with through the window they put the coal down. I do not know if there were several tenants in the house, whether each one had his own storage for the coal. Wa -- he was -- he was selling coal, and it's cold only half a year, so it's only about half the income, the yearly income. So --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So things were not easy.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think -- I think he also delivered to fact -- sold to factories and so, which were running on coal. Oil was not at that time in use for production. I don't know what electricity was made from, but I'm sure it was from coal, because it was cheap and abundant in Czechoslovakia.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, I did get -- I did get 60 crowns a month, which is two crowns a day, which allowed me to go twice to the opera.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I didn't have time to spend it. So after he told me that he can't keep me, I know I took off my star and I found a job in a resort hotel on the Czech-Bohemian Highlands. I don't remember how I got it, I don't remember how I got there, I don't remember the name or location. I do remember having work there, and what impressed me in my memory is that one day a man came from -- came in and asked me, "Are you a Jew?" I said, "Why would you want to know?" And he said, "I just was at the police station and I heard them say that at this hotel works a Jew, and they come to pick him up." So I dropped everything, changed my clothes, went to the railroad station and went home. I didn't even pick up the money for -- for -- for that period that I didn't get paid. So that was my -- but I -- I don't remember many details. And I have many such empty windows in my memory. Some -- some unbelievable ones.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Keela, uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- is -- is maintained for immigrants from Poland, because they couldn't get the working permit, or not to endanger the Czech's jobs. So the community at large, plus the keela, had to take care of them. Clothes is -- was collected, bedding and then other things, and they got a substantial meal at noon at this dining hall. I didn't mention, when this aunt told my mother I should become a cook, that many times it will be very beneficial to me, and maybe some those -- some of those related to me. So the first time was that my parents had my ration ticket and I got a good -- good meal. Not 79 dumplings, but I ate a good meal. So I worked there, and thi -- another advantage of it was that I was one of only two Jewish cooks in that whole occupied area.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, he was a [indecipherable] person I didn't judge what he -- he already had kids and I know he had a daughter who was older than I was. Anyway, he immediately contradicted himself. He said to ghetto to hold all the Jews. And then he said if I volunteer and come with him, he would protect my parents from being deported further to the east from that ghetto. As a member of the Council of Elders, he would protect my parents from -- that means before this ghetto, Terezin, Theresienstadt was created, the officials at the -- at the Jewish community knew that it's not going to be a permanent ghetto, it's going to be a transition station for further deportations.</p></p></dialogue>

I'm ahead of the game, and my parents have a chance to stay there -- there was no thought about the concentration camps, and annihilation and then gassing and the -- that was not known until the very end. Nobody outside the concentration camp knew what's expecting the deportees upon their arrival in Auschwitz, or wha -- that was not known of Auschwitz -- and people would not have even believed it and have not believed it later on. There was [indecipherable] always optimistic. Now -- and there were some people who were arrested for political -- by the Germans, opponents. And they later got -- the family received a card that he died, that family member arrested six months ago, died in Auschwitz for -- on a heart attack. So those who came afterwards, and came to Auschwitz, wrote back. They couldn't say, I'm in Auschwitz, but they wrote, in these 30 allowed words, I am at Uncle Joe's, or with Uncle Joe, to let them know he's in Auschwitz.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Less against it, because I said that, what he promised, and she thought there may be a chance. And nobody expected it to be, you will -- okay, you will be displaced, and replaced somewhere else. Nobody had an idea, a military barracks that the families won't be -- there were ghettos before in Poland, but these were voluntary ghettos where Jews have, on their own will, congregated to be away from the anti-Semites, and felt better and safer, and on their own. So these were voluntary ghettos, and there the Germans just drew a barbed wire around the district, and they had the ghetto.

So the electricity and the -- and the water and the sewer, all these -- these people were specialists picked for that job, and some of it was outside --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Outside.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- the barracks, and outside the ghetto. So they went with -- accompanied by a gendarme.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Czech gendarme. And some of them were very good, they felt, you know, that one Czech to another, and the re-relation didn't make a difference. Some were bad, and some were afraid to be good.</p></p></dialogue>

Anyway, I started to say that until 1938, those barracks were used -- occupied and used by the military and since the German occupation, there was no military in those barracks, they were closed. And of course, they started to deteriorate, a lack of maintenance, and weather, and rusty and dusty, and -- and repairs, the floor, the pipes. So -- but I couldn't get anybody to help me to prepare the kitchens, because they had their assigned job. Until later they got the idea that it's good to have some relations with the kitchen under the conditions we were living at, and they came and helped, that they did some manual work, and the engineers did some repair. And they finally got the one kitchen going. There were two kitchens in the Sudeten.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Two kitchens in the Sudeten. So what ha -- how did people eat when you first came?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We were told to take a three day something -- for the first day some sandwiches, and then some non-perishable food like a canned food or so, there was no frozen, or whatever --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right, right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- prepared meals. So for three days we took --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Your own food.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- our own food, and we were able on the third day already to prepare a soup, and -- and bread was delivered for the 342.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, did you make the soup because you didn't have any help? Who made the soup?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That wasn't difficult to make, the soup, that if you did nothing else. That -- that -- the other cook was there, we worked together. He was not very enthusiastic about it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And what did you have, huge -- huge pots?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Kettle, like you saw in that picture.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Huge, yeah, 400 liter, hundred gallon kettles. Some were steam heated from a central steam line, which then had to be augmented, the capacity I mean, of which. And some burn coal. So there -- you found -- I'm jumping ahead again. Okay, we're in that kitchen and preparing it and we got ready, and six days later, a transport of thousand people came from Brno, that's the capital of Moravia.</p></p></dialogue>

But what they did, they kept families together. In my case it was negative, because they wanted me to be together with my parents, so they came three weeks after me, while they otherwise might have, by chance, stayed longer in their accommodations at home.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And this principle prevailed also when transports were put together from Terezin to the east.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: They would bra -- keep families together.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Families together, unless one of the family members were -- was in a job -- it could work both ways -- a job that was necessary either for war industry or -- or for maintenance of the town -- functioning of the town, they either kept the one and send the rest, or they kept the whole family back. And I don't know who and why and how these decisions were made, but these were three ways of people staying in Terezin till the end, or being shipped out.</p></p></dialogue>

But at least somebody who knows how to handle food -- food. Now, there was flour in -- in the warehouses. There was some sugar, there was some margarine, and interestingly, there was plenty of spices. Pepper, paprika, caraway. I guess that was not a -- an item the Germans were short of. But there was no vegetable, there was no fruit. There was occasionally some marmalade, and not to jump too fast, we started up one kitchen, and then, or after that first transport, every second day, third day, another thousand people came. And I don't remember how many thousands that Sudeten held, but when it was full, the Germans decided to separate women from the men.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So at first when they came to the Sudeten, they were together?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Often families together, yeah. And I never went up to look how they a-accommodated with a -- a family occupies one of the three sections of the bunk, or above each other, or -</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah. So when they se -- decided to separate the women from the men, they designated the Dresner for the women.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Although the -- no meat was handled. Oh yes, when the horse died somewhere in the neighborhood, we got it in -- we got it -- we got --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You got in the meat.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We got the meat. And if there was a butcher store originally, for the germ -- yeah -- I'm handling it too fast.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We were isolated and walking from barracks to barracks or to the workplace, accompanied by gendarmes. By June 1942, the last of these town inhabitants was evacuated by the Germans. I don't know how they were accommodated, whether they found them, but that wasn't my problem.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Whe -- when -- when in 1942 did this happen? Early?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: June.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: June of 1942?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: June deg42.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And from then on, the gates of the barracks were open, and when you finished your job, your work, your assigned work, you could go with that family and move around without being accompanied or guarded. So I went from barrack to barracks, and part of just preparing the kitchen, was also training people to -- to -- I did get information of what is in the -- in the warehouse. And I got information how many people are already living there. So based on that, I made use of supplies for individual barracks, and later on even a sophisticated menu, how many grams of what to --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really? So how did you figure this out? I mean, these are much larger populations than you were ever trained to feed.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. I told you, there's one -- there were some women who were able to administer the kitchen, not just the butchers, and that [indecipherable] it's -- it's funny that there was no meat, but the butchers seemed to be the best administrators of a kitchen.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did -- w-were you the person who was in control of the amount of -- of whatever ingredients could be sent, whether it was flour, it was sugar, it would be sent to this barrack, or that barrack, or this kitchen?</p></p></dialogue>

Later there were people who were in business, food business, so I had stores at -- and groceries and -- and other related business. They became -- they became the warehouse -- o-operating the warehouse, and this -- they didn't got the information, and without my interference or -- or participation, based on the initial set-up, delivered directly to --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And were there equal rations given to each barrack, or were there different -- differences in the barracks?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> A Not in the barracks, the difference was -- and that was -- you know, the Council of Elders had very -- they were, so to say, the town administration. They were actually a cabinet, there was a man designated for transportation and for labor and for health and for supply, and -- and other departments. But they had very little room for initiative. That was all based on strict rules set by the Germans. However they, where possible, they applied their own decision making. Like for instance for the children, and that was a little bit later, the -- a children's kitchen was -- was created, that had more of the food a growing child needs, because children were our future. And they decided those who had hard labor assignments to get more food. Of course, that was taken away from the general population, but the general population was so large, that the few privileged groups -- and it wasn't privileged, was rewarded appropriately, larger por -- rations. But it did not impact tremendously.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You don't think it impacted the general population very much?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not much was taken away from all the thousands of the regular population to feed the few -- to improve the ration of the children and the -- those who have hard -- performed hard labor. So at -- this way I was hopping from one barrack to another, trying to get the most capable person to stay behind and run it, all while I was 18 - 18 and a half.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you feel --</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did -- did you have contact with the Council of the el -- Elders, with Schliesser, after you got there? Was there meet -- for instance, a meeting?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It -- it -- not -- really not, really not. He had his jobs to do, and I did mine, and there was no -- he did -- except those, as I said, the instructions as to portion size for the kids, and then the decision to create a kit -- a children's kitchen and a diet kitchen.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What does that mean?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: What does that mean? That was maybe in the small -- I think it was a p-previous restaurant in -- for the civilians of the -- the kitchen was then, for people who had diabetes or gall bladder or stuff, to give more of one item that they can have, and less of something that would be harmful to them. You know, a -- a diet within the framework of availability.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So give me an idea of the kind of food people will have for breakfast, and then for lunch or dinner. And I'm assuming now, given your explanation, that most people in the general population, 90 percent or 95 percent of the population, is eating out of these big kitchens. Very few people have apartments and cook for themselves, am I correct?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was only very later, and -- and these were only some of the privileged people --</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- who had connections to get a room in one of those -- where the -- where the town population was living, they got one room per family, and they had a little kerosene cooker, or so, and --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So would you say it was 10 percent of the population --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, much less.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- or less -- much less than that?</p></p></dialogue>

This is something that has developed -- you know, a barter system has developed. There was no money, so everyone -- it may not sound nice, but that's what happened, everyone who had access to something, like the carpenter had access to wood, the cook had access to food, there were workshops where they worked for the Germans, so s -- that was a mitzvah to steal from the Germans. The other was a little less colorful. The cooks were expected to give their family little more, but it was not ethical to steal more and get from a carpenter a shelf, where you put up your shaving stuff, you know?

So if somebody stole their something [indecipherable] so where, everywhere somebody had something that somebody else wanted, he bartered for or something he wanted or needed, or didn't need, but got it anyway.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Edgar, before we get on to your roommates, and -- and your relationship with Schacter, I wanted to ask you about what kind of food was -- was served. I mean, it's a little overwhelming for anybody to think of thousands of people being cooked for, under these conditions especially.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's why I tried to introduce Schacter, because we have something in common.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [coughs] Sorry. He -- I consider him a psychologist without a certificate, or without a diploma. He recognized the -- and I'11 come to your question --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- he recognized immediately upon his arrival, the -- that the prison mentality can sink into the people's mind. That when he came, when the gates were still closed, and he got everybody together and encouraged them to sing. And most of the songs were Czech popular songs, which most of people knew. And it had a tremendous impact on everybody, not just during the time you were singing, and gathers others who were not singing, were sitting there and listening, to the point that not just that hour, hour and a half, you forgot every -- that the reality of your actual circumstances, but you took with you a little bit of -- like a care package, a -- a spiritual care package to help you carry on i-in -- for the -- until the next time when we sing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So this was -- he did this in the Sudeten barrack when you first came --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The Sudeten in the basement, and not only that, I mentioned to you that the gates were closed, and the women were in another barracks. I don't know how he managed, he appeared in the women's barracks, and did the same with the women, with the same beneficial impact. So I -- why I represented him before answering your question, I knew that the Czechs lived through their stomach. Even now, this family, when they come to visit, the sister-in-law and the nephews and nieces, food is so meaningful, they come into the house, and they go right, pick up the covers of the pots and -- and then pinch here, and pinch there. I tried with those ingredients we had, to make food that's mainly a Czech -- Czech food. Dumplings -- we had flour. I don't know how, on my request, yeast came into the camp, and we made dumplings, and from this so-called coffee, that was a dark grain, nothing to do with coffee, but it was dark and looked like it, and we cooked it, and let it cool, and at the right temperature, if you put in some margarine and whipped it, it didn't dissolve completely, and it -- you know it didn't melt. It stayed like little dots of mar -- people thought that's the best sauce on a dumpling they ever ate. And some people asked after the war, said, could you make it for me?</p></p></dialogue>

And I say Czech because these people were first Czechs, and then they were Jews, then they were -- if not they, then somebody else made them aware that they are Jews.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So in this way I mention Schacter first, because in his way he did work on the Czech mind, and I worked on the Czech stomachs.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But I -- I'm still not completely clear on once the kitchens were going in all the different barracks, and I assume that all the barracks had their own kitchen, am I correct?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, yeah. And then there was -- and from the nearby neighborhood of those houses where the origin population lived, nearest to each barrack, those people were designated to this particular barrack.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right, uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And then the further -- located further away, for those -- sorry, for those a kitchen was built in -- on the main road, and that was only to be delivered to another location, central location where those able of walking could come to. And from that kitchen also, the ones who couldn't come were supplied like meals on wheels, Terezin style. So --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You mean, the elderly who couldn't go --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- or the people who were disabled, who couldn't go. So d-do you think people starved in Terezin?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Those who had no connection to, or anything to barter with, or had something but were in the attic and couldn't get down and mingle, those really -- it was -- it's not starving on the street falling down, but they, of malnutrition, lack of vitamins and -- and s -- lack of appropriate amounts of food, even if it wasn't the right food, caused them to -- made them susceptible to diseases and we had the best doctors, all the doctors were there.</p><p>There was a operating room that was brought in from a Jewish hospital in Prague. And if you only need a doctor's attention, you had the best attention, but if you needed medication, you were [indecipherable]. I had my hernia operated there.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And ne -- didn't need anything else except a surgeon's intervention. And I healed, and that was okay.

That -- they were dying in the -- in that -- in the infirmary, or -- or where they lived, but it was maybe not direct starving, but starvation induced susceptibility to diseases which put them in pneumonia.

So, I -- I totally lose presence of mind, and just instinct. There were two very young SS men, they would de -- everybody called them kindergarten. And they were driving the tractors that were pulling the -- the heavy loads, so they were -- because the Jews, they didn't want to entrust a Jew, that distracts the Jews. And one day they come in front of the Hamburger. There's an old man going, and one of them -- I -- he didn't see them, he didn't take his hat off, or whatever, and they went in and started to unload on him, with hitting. I went with a friend, I tore loose, and I knocked them both down to the ground. A normal person wouldn't do that, but that's the condition I get in when it snaps. And they started to shoot, but they were drunk, and it didn't help. So they get the police, grab me in, pull me into their guard room, and the other guy went to the head of the Council of Elders to tell him about it. And he cleaned it up, because those two were drunk and shouldn't have been there. So somehow I got away. I don't know how, because nobody attacks SS men unpunished.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It is another way, but I -- but I think it's a more s -- s -- it's more serious than that.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Could have been there, not many, but under those conditions, and not knowing transports have -- were lea -- were leaving, and you don't know where they go, or -- or what's happening. So the level of morality sank a little, and people wanted to enjoy as much as they could, and as long as they could. And you did not have to be in love just to perform and enjoy. So I don't know whether, or how many, if so, would have used this as a currency.</p></p></dialogue>

So there's a chance that they -- they can go together and she wouldn't -- her supervisor wouldn't let her go, because she worked in the agriculture, which was bringing in harvest for the Germans. The agriculture was not for the ghetto, that was for the Germans.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't know how many were doing these individual opera performances, but I know for the Requiem there were 150. He started another Czech opera, and then when German Jews came, and these were -- the German Jews they were not -- there were very few young people, very few. Very few young middle class, these were older, upper middle class, and then the -- the prominent ones, the old ones who fought in World War I, with whom the German played a cruel game. They promised them -- or told them, leave everything here, your furniture, your money, your belongings, the -- the glass in the showcase. We are bringing you to a spa where you will have no worry. You will have maid service, and room service, and food service, and laundry service. And these guys, after observing three or four or five years, how the Germans treat -- how the Nazis treated the German Jews in Germany, still believed the officer's word. The -- the reason that they came, at a time when the barracks, and the houses of the town population were already filled, and the only place for them was in the attics of the barracks. They will put straw mattresses on the floor, and you can imagine the old people going down to the floor to lay down to sleep, and even worse to get up to sleep. And if you have heard about it, older people have to go to the bathroom more often. So first to get up, and then climb over -- I guess these mattresses were one next to the other, to accommodate as many as possible, climb over the people with a dim light, because the light was dim so the rest can sleep.</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And if they couldn't hold it, I don't have to describe you the hygienic and sanitary conditions that have developed, which contributed to the acce -- accelerated death rate.</p><p>And also, many of them lost will to live. They were de -- they were deceived, heartbroken by the German officers and -- to whom they had so much trust. And so many suicides among them, among the old people. And then, as I said, quick deterioration through lack of sanitation and -- and cleanliness, and that was a very poor sight. But Schacter immediately took his Czech Jews, and started to study "Marriage of Figaro," for the same purpose, to pep up that -- those German prisoners. And "Magic Flute," and the Czech singers were s -- most of the Czechs spoke German, because not only at the -- at the border area, but most Czechs had frequent use for the German language. So German was pretty used among the Czech Jews.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And these were concert versions of the operas?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Concert versions, yeah -- no, no costumes, no.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Just the piano.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, I'm going to go off this topic for just a second, because you mentioned that the old German Jews often committed su -- many committed suicide. How did they commit suicide? Did they jump out of windows?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: A window, yeah. And some may have had the -- the -- taken a excessive dose of sleeping pills, or whatever they still brought with them. They deteriorated a very rapid fa -- rate.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Di -- wi -- I want to continue o-on your relationship and the work with Schacter, but I also wanted to ask you, there were -- there were orchestras in Terezin, there are composers, there are other conductors, yes?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So that there is a lot going on. Am I correct?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: How did it come about? Now there is a -- a saying going around, and you must have heard it, that the Germans picked Theresienstadt as a town to show off with. It wasn't that way. I mentioned it among other things in their hometown, they had to turn in their musical instruments, and some didn't. And some even had the chutzpah, people who will read this may know what that means, had the guts to bring those ins -- smuggle those</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. <span class="page-break" number="63"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 5 instruments with i -- within those 110 pounds, instead of food and clothing, into Terezin, because they were so -- such ardent musicians, amateurs and professionals, who loved to play, and because everybody thought it's going to be over in six months. I spoke about the optimism. When the six months were over, they gave themselves another six months.</p><p>So they played in attics, and in cellars, to stay in shape for when they come out, they should be in the same performance level as they came in. And although there are no -- were no Germans in the ghetto, nothing escaped them, they found out. And now a terrific fright and concern gripped everyone in the ghetto, because the Germans -- a few Germans kept all these thousands of Jews in check by imposing corrective punishment.</p><p>So what that means, were two kinds, either right away into the transport, with -- and these people were marked, when they were in the transport, in Auschwitz they know who they are, and they select them -- direct them to the appropriate side, punishing side, or the small fortress. So nobody wanted to involve their wife, parents, children, siblings in such a punishment, so there was a big concern. The head of the Council of Elders, Edelstein told the camp commander why -- I mean, not in this exact wording, I'm paraphrasing, why would you punish these few people? Look at the amount of talent you have accumulated here, why don't you think of a program where you can utilize them to show the world how well you treat the Jews? That's when this idea came into being. It was not a preconceived idea with the Germans before the ghetto was created. So not only were these Jews not punished, and could retain their instruments, more instruments were brought in from Prague, and before they determined how they are going to do -- show the world how well they treat the Jews, they already divide -- devised a beautification program in anticipation of that, and a free time activities department was created. And in the frame of this orchestras -- jazz has just come to -- to Europe from United States, so we had a five member -- what is it called? Ghetto swingers. Ghetto swingers jazz team.</p><p>Then there were the two musicians who played in the cafe. One of them was my cousin, the accordionist, he was a piano and accor -- but there he played the accordion, and one was a violinist. And -- and other of the quartets, and unbelievable, not the Germans, and not the Council of Elders could have imagined what's getting news there. And not only music, there were theaters -- there were all the actors from -- from all these towns. The theater, cabaret, those are very popular because they were throwing these verbal darts at the Germans, in Czech language. Maybe some even in German, I don't know about those.</p><p>And this was very uplifting, and very helping in -- in really reducing the anxieties of the life that was destined for us. There were lectures. There were 1240 lectures on different subjects. This is based on the notes from that -- that they found from that free activity -- free time activity list, by professors, chemists, biologists, rabbis. Nobody went to the temple, but they went there to listen to the rabbi. And people who had no interest in chemistry and so, went to j -- just to get diversification, and -- and getting away from -- from this dread life of ghetto. By the way, they called -- you know, Terezin in German is Theresienstadt, and the Nazis told these prominent people they go to Theresienbath, which is a Theresien spa. I didn't say it when we were on the subject. So it is an unbe -- there was more -- more of these cultural activities per capita than in New York or -- or anywhere else, in a day. And people after work went, and they -- they shortened their sleeping time, because they were not really strong with the -- with the food they were getting, and I don't take blame for it. I just did what was -- we had. But it was -- it was unbelievable, it -- it was -- it grew like mushrooms after the rain.</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't know, actually my stuff my mother brought, and I don't know whether she hung it somewhere, or whether she -- she was a very fussy lady. At home I remember when I went for vacation to her siblings, they were -- one day they were s-soaking, the next day they were boiling the stuff, the third day they were washing. And then it was washed, they took it down to the beach -- to the river, spread it out on the lawn and let it bleach in the sun. And when it was dry they made it wet again so it can bleach some more.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You know, people tried, with connections -- if you knew someone in that office, if you knew someone very well, you could go there and say, do something with that card. So they do something, but another family has to go.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So then you would feel -- should feel bad, although they may be going in the next transport, but at that time you did something that -- it wasn't right. When I speak in schools, I had a sixth grader ask me, "Do you feel guilty that you survived?" And that's a heavy question for a sixth grader. And I didn't. I don't feel guilty, because I would fe -- I -- I fe -- I would feel guilty if 1 would have caused somebody else to die, but I don't feel guilty that I survived, I only feel sad for those who didn't. And this -- that -- you get some of these tough questions from those kids.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you ever feel -- forget guilty, because clearly you didn't do something against anybody, right? But there is a kind of -- I don't know whether I want to call it moral compromise one makes. You can't be morally pure in a situation like that. So the fact that you're protected always means that someone else is unprotected.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Let's talk about the Requiem.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, that comes afterwards. First we have to talk about the inspection of the international Red Cross. And the Germans just decided what they will do, and who will be there, report card writer. We found out it's the international Red Cross, everybody was happy.</p><p>Now, the international Red Cross, they will force them to make it real, a proper, a good and beneficial stay here. Give all of us to have a beneficial stay. So it was designated which way they will led -- be led, on that -- that was the main street between the square and the -- and the church. The barracks and tents, where the war industrial production was taking place was all taken down. The girls from the agriculture planted lawn and -- and flower beds on that square. And the houses on that street all got a face lift, a -- a new coat of paint. And stores were opened, money was printed. Have you seen the money?</p><p>You must have.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: [inaudible].</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Terezin money in all denominations, and it looks like money of any other country, except for George Washington, there was Moses with the two tablets on it. And there was not much to do with it, becau -- so they opened the bank, and you could make a -- a savings account, but there was no interest on your money, just to deposit it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So when did all of that start? The pre -- the -- the preparation for the "44 -- do you know?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: End of "42, beginning of deg43.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So it's a long period of time?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And there was a shoe store and the clothes store, and I think I told you about it. They put the -- the clothing that was in that warehouse was suddenly put out, put on coat -- a co -- coat hangars, and exposed and exhibited in that store, and the shoes, too. And that was that -- the only benefit of that money. You could buy for the -- get the money, because after three years, your shoes wear, and your clothes wear, you have not much to change.</p><p>So that was a benefit. There was a grocery store, and they were selling there mustard and relish. I don't know, the Germans must have had a -- a surplus of those two items. But it was a good -- good to -- to vary a taste of your slice of bread that you got.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Some the Germans would steal, and some th -- take out, consider contraband. And you know, if they send a loaf of bread it was cut open to see where there's anything inside that shouldn't be there. Like in prisons. And so -- and some was stolen by the people who worked in that Terezin Post Office, other Jews. That's the dark side of the prisoners. And so these were the few things I can remember the money was good for.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So if this starts in "43, all the preparations, is that when Schacter comes up with the idea of the Verdi Requiem?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: For some reason, in January deg43, the last transport was sent away, and here we are in July, and no transports since January. I have no idea why. Everybody was up and happy, that this is the end of deportations. So he also had got the courage to start to implement what he was thinking the Requiem, knowing, or at least anticipating that this choir will stay together. There was a huge uproar when he came up with that idea. All the scholars and professors, and the -- and the bor -- the borders -- the -- the elder -- the -- the Council of Elders, they all protested for different reasons. The -- the scholars and the rabbis, why would you as Jews in a Jewish ghetto perform a Catholic mass for the dead, when there are comparable works on Jewish themes? [indecipherable] and so, which cannot be performed in -- anywhere in occupied Europe, and this is the only place you could. He did not give in to this. He didn't say it openly because it was dangerous to say, but I know that he -- his mind was on being -- wanting to be able to sing to the Germans in Latin what he couldn't tell them in German to their face. Like the -- the [indecipherable] the day of wrath, the [indecipherable] that it -- i-in this book, the names of all the sinners are inscribed, and none will escape the punishment.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Edgar, you were talking about the council being possibly upset if the German -- I mean --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Really upset.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- upset if the Germans would find out. Now, let me ask you something. You said you know from Schacter what -- what he was really feeling.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was the driving thought behind --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes. Yeah, is -- is that because you were rooming with him at this time, and you talked with him?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. This friend of mine, the lawyer, meanwhile was deported, and we found in a attic of a house in the a backyard of one of those private houses, that must have been a mother-in-law arrangement, and the stairs up to the attic, and with a carpenter connection again, we got a -- a little separation, and we had a room with privacy for the two of us.</p><p>And so I was pretty much informed about him, his lifestyle, his thoughts, and his determination. And --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But let me ask you -- I -- I just want to know -- understand something. You -- did you meet him separately from joining the choir, or only when you joined the choir?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Through the choir --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Through [indecipherable]</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- we met, and for -- for some reasons, including that I provided some more food for him, we Ca -- we came close.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You got together, I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I still mention, I don't have any complexes that he would have found in me a -- a level companion, cause I was a young guy, and his circle were the musi -- social circle were the musicians, the composers, and he had other interests. But we were very close, and very good, and --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And what was the difference in age between the two of you, do you think?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's a big difference, yes. But you -- you spent a lot of time together, I gather?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Busy.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- during the day we were both working, and then -- he then became part of that free time department. And I think his assignment, his job was working within this department so he didn't have to go somewhere to a -- I don't know stone quarry, or whatever he worked in in that. So that was his day job. And then in the evening, after everybody finished, they came for rehearsal.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So did he tell you ver -- talk to you about wanting to do the Verdi Requiem?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And he told you what --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And he said why, that we can't tell them in German, and I -- it's -- it's -- it has to come out, and this is one way I can get it out. And when he was told about all the dangers, he told everyone in the choir, "It is assumed to be dangerous to you, to us, to the rest of the inmates here. So if you don't want to be part of it, I don't feel bad if you leave." Nobody left.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And what did the council th-think about the danger, that -- that somehow the Nazis would discover his intention?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That if they find out that he -- that the purpose of this was to tell them, you bastards, you going to get it at one point, that they will not appreciate it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But let me ask you something, when you read the words of the Verdi Requiem, it's als -- there's also words of forgive these people, whoever they are, who -- who, and the Requiem is speaking about both the wrath of God and begging for forgiveness, so --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, so this -- this part we ignored.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But you sang it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And -- yeah, ignored as a -- as a thought --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- that propelled us to do it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Isee.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And in saying the -- the Libera me, was interpreted as set me free from here.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When -- when you were rehearsing, did you feel this kind of emotion, that you -- wh- when -- just when you're rehearsing yourself --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I just felt I'm part of a group that despises the Germans and the Nazis, and that this is the best we can do to get even with them within our capabilities.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was the -- were the rehearsals more intense than when you did "The Bartered Bride," and "The Magic Flute," and "The Marriage of Figaro"?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was, because it was a different language, and it was much more difficult music.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh, right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And much more concentration was required. And some people who didn't work in the kitchen, were not so well-fed to really dedicate themselves to such a -- that was a hard --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- work on a half empty stomach.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes, it's difficult singing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. So with the fact that there were no transports, he was encouraged that he"! have an easy job, as easy as this can be. Th -- am sure Toscanini would have never undertaken it with -- with well-fed people, to teach them without a score. So it took six weeks -- we were six weeks into the rehearsal when the rumors sprung up the transports will resume.</p><p>So every time a transport is put together, people from different sectors are involved. And so the choir members anticipated that some of them will definitely be included in the transport. So they pushed him to make one performance for them, for their hard work, so they can enjoy performing it. And he would not, because it wasn't up to his standards yet.</p><p>But then it became known that by September six, 5,000 people will be deported. He couldn't resist, because he knew a lot of them will be in it, and he made a performance for them and their families and friends, not the 0 -- open, public sh -- performance.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So this is September deg43?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And the irony with this, the sad irony, that these 5,000 people -- about -- he lost about half the choir, and these people went to Auschwitz and they came there, and they were treated differently than anybody else who came before them and after them. They could</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

They lived together, not in privacy, but families were together. And they were there for six months, and they were not working, they did not -- and this Freddie Hirsch, he took care of the kids, entertained them and taught them.</p><p>Als -- also made sport with them, and art, and he really took care of the kids. And this group was held there while the Germans were negotiating with the allies in exchange of the German prisoners of war for these Jews, and also some war material. They wanted some trucks, and -- and of course the allies wouldn't give the Germans another few thousand soldiers that will then turn against them, and trucks that they will use in the war against them. So when the negotiations fell through, in one night, all of those who were still alive from the 5,000 went into the gas. Was exactly three months -- six months later, on March eight. And this is also -- on March seventh is the -- was Masaryks" birthday, President Masaryk, the first -- the creator of Czechoslovakia. So could be that had something to do with it, because they were -- they were planning the -- timing some things to coincide with some -- something that gives you a bigger -- a ce -- bor -- bigger pain.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was Schacter worried that he was going to be deported at that point?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No, because --</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was he protected in some way, do you think?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not that I knew, but those people who put together the transport list had some kind of directives whom to leave out, as long as it was possible.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And as far as you know, who was it who put together these transport lists?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: There was a department, it was called evidence. Evidence is where all the files about every single one who came into Terezin was kept. A card with a name, with a transport, date of birth, a transport when they came in, and -- and also the transporting date when they left Terezin. I did after the war search, y -- my parents survived, in spite of Schliesser being sent to Auschwitz, and myself, my parents survived. I thought the easiest thing would have been if he had written on top of the card -- of their card, do not deport it, initial it, that would have been the easiest. I got copies of those cards, there's nothing there, and I was researching how he did it, because he must have done it, because it's inconceivable that two, old, useless people would stay there, especially before the Red Cross came, they deported a lot of old people, they wanted only -- they wanted the Red Cross only to see young, good looking people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Maybe there was a special section for cards, a different place.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And was that then approved by the council, or did they just do it themselves?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The head of the Council of Elders had to sign the transport list.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: List.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And then later we get to why he was -- and the whole Council of Elders was sent away.</p><p>He must have found out where they go, and what's happening, and their destination, and he refused to sign it. He told the camp commander, you sign it. So he, the camp commander, must have guessed that he knows what's happening, and didn't want the word to be spread among the inmates because a panic would be created. So the whole council left. But even though in September six, and the -- half the choir left, and they have -- they have -- he has recruited new people and started the whole thing from the beginning with them. And he lost one more time, less people, and recruited new and started a third time with new people. And then in January 44 was the first performance.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And when you did the September performance, September "43, before that first deportation, was that with a piano accompaniment?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Everything was only piano --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Only piano.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And when I listen now to a Requiem with a concert, and a -- the -- the trumpets and the drums, I said how -- it seemed to us like -- like absolutely perfect performance, just the piano.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And a crappy piano on top of it. How did they bring out all these -- these impressions, these results [indecipherable] of -- that the orchestra can provide.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And did he play the piano, or did he do the conducting and someone else played?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, bu -- there -- during the rehearsal he played the piano, and do -- and during -- in the performance, Gideon Klein played.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So it's a -- it's somewhat odd, however, to play only at a performance, and never at a rehearsal.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Gideon Klein had other work to do --</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- and he was playing per -- giving performances. Schacter, that's why I said he didn't tolerate any inattention, because everybody had to look at his eyes, and see when he gets the signal.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember anything ever going wrong in the concerts?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Wrong?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In the concert?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I'm sure it did, but everybody was so grateful for it that -- that either they didn't notice, didn't want to notice, didn't make an impact on them, they were happy to -- to be part of it whether active or passive.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, once you started giving performances, or Schacter is conducting the performances of the Requiem, starting in January deg44 -- January deg44, right? You give about 14 or 15 --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: 15, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: 15 performances.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And each time with less singers.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you ne -- he never restarts again, he just accommodates?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Only three times. Only three times he started to -- with new people. And then after the 15", he was left with 60 singers.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Out of 150.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And not the same amount in each voice.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So he didn't want it. But then came the order from camp commander, that he wants a performance of the Requiem for high SS officials who came from Vienna and Prague, from Berlin, to shake the hands of the Red Cross people who were also invited -- no Jews.</p></p></dialogue>

And you know they had to pay homage to the Red Cross [indecipherable] and so now, I didn't know -- he didn't want to do it with the -- with the regular choir, but it was an opportunity he was dreaming of. Not only can he sing it to them for distance, but he has them right in front of him, they are sitting there, and he can really tell them.</p><p>And the paradox again is, that we all thought -- we told him, and the Germans were the only ones who knew that we were actually singing our own Requiem. You know, they knew where we will end up. They didn't think that there would be some survivors. So that was a mutual giving it to each other.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And the Germans knew what was being sung, because they knew the Catholic liturgy.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think -- I'm sure, yeah. But I think they -- they thought it's a -- it's a musical performance, and -- but they also understood the meaning of it, and what's going to happen with us, that this is --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Your own Requiem.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Our own eulogy. The -- when this Red Cross came, I couldn't understand that they accept the German conditions that they will not interview people at random on the street, only special auditioned people that the Germans prepared to meet them. And they knew that they're saying lies, but it was again against the threat of the whole family being endangered if they refuse. So they did it. But I don't -- still don't understand, if you were psychologist, rather than philosophy doctor, I would ask you, how is it possible to audition, and indoctrinate little kids to the same performance? When they came to the playground, and there were some kids who never been on a playground because they were not allowed at home to go, the little ones. When they came for the chocolate bar that was on the table in front of the playground, the only one uniform was Rahm, and they had to address him uncle, and they, "Uncle Rahm, again chocolate?" As if they were already fed up with chocolate, and there were some kids who never knew what chocolate was because it wasn't on their ration tickets at home. This I don't understand, how they got the kids to do that. Maybe they told them you're going to play a theater or whatever.</p><p>But this were tough for me to understand.</p></p></dialogue>

This doesn't belong to my li -- yeah, I hear the party. After the war, in -- in Newton was a Harvard philosophy psychology professor who researched to write a book about the Red Cross, International Red Cross at that time, what they should have done and didn't do, and they shouldn't have done and did do. And he was researching it, and I knew about it because I was translating his papers that he brought from Germany, from Austria, even the French. And at one point he told me he had an appointment with the then president of the International Red Cross, Dr. Rossler. In his office, in his factory -- he had aluminum, a huge aluminum factory in Switzerland, and he came there, and the secretary says, "Oh, Dr. Rossler called, he apologizes, he'll be an hour, hour and a half late from another appointment. Make yourself comfortable in the library." Brought in cup of coffee, said [indecipherable] whatever. And he perused -- and he found documents that he had branch factories in Austria and in Germany where he used prisoners from concentration camp. So how much was his enthusiasm to confront Germans, the Nazis? Speaks for itself. So --</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And I'm sorry they didn't, but some single guy who didn't have a family could have spilled the beans, but it wouldn't have helped, because this was called the International Red Cross, but the seven directors all were Swiss.</p></p></dialogue>

Does Schacter keep you folks singing? There's a few months there after -- after the Red Cross visit, or is he deported?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, but Schacter taught me. He started to teach me to play the piano, then I started to read music. And unfortunately, it didn't go for very long, and after the war I had no chance to resume. I had to work to maintain my parents and myself because we had nothing except what they had left from the 110 pounds. I had nothing, coming from Auschwitz.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was that also surprising to you that that happened?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We found out that -- why it happened, I don't know that -- how -- how it became known, but we found out in the -- on the street that the Germans were [indecipherable] for this.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. Now, you said that Schacter was a very sweet guy when he wasn't being a conductor, but once he was going to be serious about his music, he was a tyrant. Was he also charismatic?

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He just was -- he demanded full attention, there was -- there was nothing else but rehearsing, and if you wanted to be with him, you had to pay full attention.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I think what I mean is, obviously people wanted to be with him.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It wasn't just the music, because you could have somebody in front of you who is conducting, who you didn't want to be with, right?

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So he was primarily a conductor, yes. Did he ever conduct some of the work of the composers who were working in Terezin, Olan, or --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Very few of those works were presented to the public. They -- they played it, they performed it for the critique of the other musicians only. So those compositions were not heard in public in Terezin.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: "Brundibar" is another story. That was composed in Prague, still, and when Krasa was deported to Terezin, he left the manuscript with the director of the orphanage, who was a musician himself.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So when we came to Prague -- to -- to Terezin, he continued to work with "Brundibar" with an enlarged ensemble, it -- other kids, not just those from the orphanage. And he -- and Krasa was -- was very happy with it. He did not interfere or participate in anything else, or any of those performances. There was a time when Schacter auditioned -- not auditioned, rehearsed with the kids, but he never conducted "Brundibar." It was always this Freundenfeld.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Huh. So often the person who rehearsed the kids would not necessarily be the one that would --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> A No, it was not very often. This Freundenfeld, he was dedicated to that. There were 55 performances of "Brundibar".</p></p></dialogue>

That was -- and the Germans didn't know, because they were singing with -- in Czech. So that was a similar kind of a resistance, or at least a sole improvement and spiritual enlightenment as the --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But what -- from what you explained, it's clear that the Germans are oppressors, but it was not clear to you or your colleagues that they were murderers.</p></p></dialogue>

He brought in the SS uniform and took him out on a motorcycle from Auschwitz. And he came to Prague -- to Terezin, and he spoke with Edelstein, and told him about what's happening, and nobody would believe him. This is impossible, it is -- it's unthinkable. But then there were some other -- for instance, those people who were helping load or unload the -- the dep-deportees noticed on the wagons that the -- always the same ones were coming back, you know, they are numbered, coded, numbered.

Also, not saying why, so I'm sure the guy didn't listen, if he needed a cane to support themself. And we were put on five abreast lined up, the whole contingent. And we were moving forward, and you can -- forward I saw two SS uniformed men with white gloves. And when my -- when I was in the first row, they went to the -- through the five, and he just looked at me and waved me to one side. And the boys were next to me, he asked them, "How old are you?" Now it lit up in their head, and they said 18, and it was their luck because he send them to the good side. So then we were -- when there were enough people together, we were marched along a -- those barbed wire fences. And there was a guard, a SS with a rifle over his shoulder walking at [indecipherable], and I naively asked him, "What are those chimneys?" They're not only smoke coming out, also sparks, and flames.

And from there, not coming back to the peg, but another door, they chased us out, naked and wet from a hot shower in the cold, wintry night, to another barrack, and then we're marching along a counter, behind which some prisoners were sitting and throwing at us a pair of pants, a jacket, and a pair of boots. And the hat to take off -- not a hat, a cap to take off when you meet an SS man, it was for no other reason there. And those -- that clothing was without regard to our size.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, not in Auschwitz.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Not in Auschwitz?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. Although I read later on that they supposedly played upon arrival for the -- for the arriving prisoners to -- still to give them a -- an impression that they're coming somewhere to a spa where the orchestra plays for them. But I -- I have not heard or seen the orchestra in Auschwitz.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see. So when people were going to work, you didn't hear anything?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. And we went to -- by tractor, or we walked, I don't remember cause I forgot. We went to the train, by whatever method. It was the same cattle wagon, and we were going to Gleiwitz, which is nearby, and it also took longer than it should have taken because the military transports had priority on the track. That's why it took three days to go to Auschwitz, a trip that shouldn't have taken longer than five, six hours.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So they take you --</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, yeah, the blow up, yes. So you're by train to Gleiwitz. And what happens when you come to Gleiwitz?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: From Gleiwitz we marched through the streets, into the camp, there's a huge camp. And the whole camp was -- all inmates in that camp were working in a -- a railroad repair shop that was fixing wagons that were damaged by the Royal Air Force on the way to the front. So with my experience, I did get a -- a cutting torch, at the gate, cutting off all the damaged parts of the wagon, and then the wagon went further on to be -- to -- to parts to be measured, and re-install the good parts. And the job had a good side and a bad one.</p><p>Everything in life, I guess, has a good and a bad side. The good one was when a wagon with garbage came in, I had the first pick. The bad part was that was in the open gate, and we had nothing, we had no underwear, no socks, just those cotton pants and the -- and the jacket. And -- very cold. My meister was a -- a Pole -- a German Pole, or a Polish German. A Pole of German nationality. He wasn't especially good, but he was one of those who was afraid to be good. He wasn't -- he wasn't very bad, but y -- we worked 12 hour shifts, six days a week, one week day, one week night. And when we went to work there was music in Gleiwitz, and when we came back was music.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: They were standing near the [indecipherable]</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- the musicians were standing next to the gate as we came in, and if we didn't march in proper step, we were helped by a kick to improve the step. Big guys like me deteriorated in Auschwitz much faster than the little skinny ones. I guess our body required more than they were offering, and a lot of pussyboils presented themselves on my back. And the pus rubbed off on the jacket, and when it dried, it rubbed back into the wounds. I also had some that were not opened, were -- the skin didn't break and the pus was pushing, and it was terrible pressure, and they were very painful. And I didn't want to go to the infirmary because the Germans didn't like sick Jews, they liked them less than the healthy Jews. So -- but it became unbearable, so I went. And there was a French doctor, I don't know whether he was a doctor, or just filled the position of a doctor -- a -- a prisoner, and he --</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

So you bite your teeth together, and -- and I went immediately back. There was no -- no bandage, no stitches, no nothing, just cut open, relief, and I went back to the barracks, and next shift I went to work.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you're welding?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You're welding?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Welding, no, cutting with a torch. I'm not -- welding is putting things together, I was --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Together, you were cutting things -- and the two boys were also with you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Each one, yeah. In -- one in the carpentry shop, he -- because one worked in -- in Terezin in the carpentry shop, cause 15 and older had to work, and one of them was carrying the plumber's toolbox. So -- and they found similar jobs. Whether they said what they did before, what their experience was -- I couldn't say what my experience was. And that second cook was in that same transport, and he came also to Auschwitz into Gleiwitz from the same camp.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. And so one day on the way home -- there was nothing -- I went -- we went full to e-elaborate on that job, other than only once in those 12 hours you were allowed to go to the bathroom. They took your number down, and if you came again, they kicked you out.</p><p>The guy who was there was called scheiss meister. [indecipherable] to spell it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: She may know how to spell that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I -- I don't know what people did who had diarrhea, but there must have been people with diarrhea. I have no idea. Th -- one day was really, really sick, tired and -- and I -- I really couldn't perform. So I found a place, and with these radiators with the ribs, you know?</p><p>There was one that allowed a little space between the wall and itself. I leaned down behind it, and there was nice, warm, and I fell asleep. It wasn't difficult for me to fall asleep until I've been awakened with a -- a rifle butt by an SS man. I think the -- the -- my meister must have told the guard that his helper is missing. So he found me. I'm glad I'm not bald because I have a very ugly protrusion still, on my head. And so he kicked me in the behind and sent me back to work. I was lucky he didn't deport me. So I did my work again, you know, you get this kind of encouragement with a boot, you continue to work. One day after the shift, we go back to camp, there was a snow on the floor -- on the ground. And I had wooden shoes, those Dutch wooden clogs, that was the only shoes that fitted me, that I got exchange. They were good -- a good and the bad side. The good was</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Walking back to the camp, I see ahead of me a huge -- only maybe it just seemed that -- that huge to me, onion on the edge -- on the side of the road. So I look back where the guard is, and told the guy behind me, step a little bit out of formation, cover me. And I bent down, and picked it up and put it in the jacket to take it to camp, because whatever either one of the three of us found, stole, or otherwise, we shared. So I took it in to share it with them. And we were brought in and lined up on the roll call area for frisking. We were frisked on -- infreque -- not infrequently like little, but unannounced because we were working with tools, and we could have made some weapon, a knife, or -- or something which the Germans did not like very much. So what do I do with the onion? If I throw it away and don't say it was me, everybody gets punished, the old theme of collective punishment. If I say it was me, they beat me to a pulp because they won't believe I found it, they will think I stole -- they will insist I stole it. Only one way out, to eat the onion, quickly. This is with the peel and with those little roots on it. The eyes were -- tears were coming down my cheeks, and the nose was running, and sweat in that cold, wintry day, sweat was coming up on my forehead. And when he ca -- I finished it before he came to me, and I didn't dare to breathe while he was frisking me. And why I am saying it is a day or -- or t -- the next day or the day after, these wounds started to get smaller and less pus-y.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The one onion did a marvelous job. But it was only one, and we continued days and weeks without another onion, so it opened up again, and the -- the pus-y routine has reappeared. But it gave me enough respect for onions that I am consuming an awful lot of them, cooked or raw. And recommending it to everybody. I don't remember much of happenings inside the camp. This other cook, second cook from Prague, he had the chutzpah on a -- in -- on the -- on the road in the camp, to stop the camp commander, who was a s.o.b. you can say, no? That's in public. He was the -- previously the commander of the crematorium and the gas chambers in Auschwitz. And here was the lager kommandant, always walking with a dog.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And his name, do you know?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, Moll. And he stopped him, he said, "(Herr Kommandant, I would like to work in my profession." And he said, "What's your profession?" He said, "I'm a cook." He said, "Did you tell it when you came into this camp?" He said, "Yes." So next Sunday on the roll call, they pull him out and put him into the SS kitchen. I wouldn't have dared to say I'm a cook when I said I'm a welder. I thought, you know -- anyway, he -- I never -- already the oldtimers in the kitchen, the veterans, they wouldn't let him anywhere near, and he has to wash dishes, the floor, the tables, just the dirty work. And one afternoon there was some mashed potatoes left from the SS menu, and he made like a decorating bag out of paper, and made some decorations like for a cake. And the SS in charge of the SS kitchen was a baker, or a -- a -- call it baker patisserie, or the fine -- fine baker, you know, the -- how do you call it?</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Pastry chef?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Pastry chef. What would I do without you? Couldn't complete the interview. He saw this, "Who made this?" And he said, "I did." "You did?" He immediately made him the proviant meister, which was in the storeroom, giving out to the cooks the -- the food, the - - the -- the items to cook. So he had everything, he was in there alone, no other veteran -- prior veteran. He took care of everyone from Terezin he knew. He saved my life.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> A At 4:30 in the morning, behind the barracks, we crawled to that SS kitchen -- and several people, and he threw at us a -- a boiled potato unpeeled, or a piece of bread, or whatever was left over. And when I was at night shift and couldn't come to the kitchen, he left me some food on the beam in the latrine. Not a very aesthetic place, but who cares? And all these things, whatever he sa -- left there we -- the three of us shared. And I don't think I would have made it without him. And so now again, nothing extraordinary. I was lucky, I was never present at -- when there was some hangings, or when somebody got 25 or 40 lashes. I never -- when I -- when we stood in the roll call place, I bent my knees not to stick out, because I was tall. Cause they -- the tall ones and those who were in some way different than the rest, they pulled out for the nice jobs like cleaning latrines, and so -- so you learn how to survive.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And are you now hearing rumors about the war, that the Russians are getting closer?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It was January already by this time, okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And we did hear faint explosions like bombs and so. And one day at n -- noon -- before noon -- before noon at the factory, over the loudspeaker came an announcement, all prisoners assemble where we usually assemble after the shift to go back. And there was not much talking. They counted us and marched us back to the camp. No music was playing. Lined up on the roll call area. After awhile we were sent to the block -- to have - - to enjoy our own luxury, each one had a blanket. We brought our blanket and it was a godsend because we could wrap it around and be a little less cold. And soon thereafter we were marched out. That was already afternoon, again without music, and that was the beginning of what they call a death march today. With the kids on my side, we are together. And there were no more kids, they were already adults, you know, this kind of a circumstance matures a person quickly. And --</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And so we marched until late at night, and we came to an already abandoned camp, evacuated -- another evacuated labor camp. So we were herded in, and right went into the bunk and fell asleep. There was no food, no drink. We were able to pick up some of the dirty snow from the road. And early morning I was -- it was not -- before dawn, they woke us up, and the Germans insisted that we go as quickly as possible. Now, we noticed whoever fell, couldn't make it, was shot on the road. On the first day with one of the kids, we were supporting one who couldn't road -- couldn't walk any more, you know, the shoulder, and under the arm. And we could do it as -- as long as he could move his feet -- his legs forward. But then he became totally heavy, we had a dead weight, and we ourselves were already weak. So we just couldn't continue to drag him, and then when we heard the shot it was like -- it felt like I was shot, you know, the -- the guy -- I felt guilty that time, I felt guilty that I didn't try more. But it wouldn't have helped, I could have only weakened myself, and wouldn't have helped him.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you both let him go, right?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And then you heard a shot?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. And then the next day after this camp, we were marched again, there was no food, no drink. Continued with the dirty snow, and at late at night again, we came to a barn. We were herded in, the -- they -- they closed the barn. And that was nice because there was something, we didn't recognize it in the dark, hay or straw. We crawled in and had a warm, soft sleep. On that day my -- on top of the shoe where the laces are -- there are no laces on the wooden, but on where on other shoes are the laces, a little triangular piece broke out, and two sharp corners were digging into my foot. And that was very unpleasant. I don't know where and how I found a piece of wax cloth, I think in that barn or around it, and I wrapped my feet into that, and that's like McDonald uses this checkered tablecloth?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That kind of material. It did not insulate me any more from the cold, but it didn't hurt like the -- that shoe. But early in the morning on the third day I felt -- I -- I will be one of those shot on the road. I am weak, tired, tough trying to drag my feet. And the kids were in -- in fairly good shape, because I mentioned the smaller ones and skinny one tolerated it better. So I said, if I stay here, I get shot. I try to escape. Whatever chance I have, I will take it. If it's 10 percent, I'll take 10 percent of success to escape. And so I told them, stay together and help each other if you need to, and I can't any more, and I have no use to you anyway. So we come to a forest, tall forest on both sides of the road, no moon, real</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

So that was the moment. I slipped to -- into the ditch on the side of the road. I don't know why I didn't encourage the kids to do it too, but I felt 1 don't want to be responsible in case -- you know, to suggest something where they may suffer. And I laid down in the snow, face down. And there was -- must have been a zealous guard who shot me. And whether it was the dark, or whether it was frozen fingers, I don't know. He shot me under the arm, and the bullet got stuck in the rib. And the snow -- the -- the blood was color -- starting to color the snow, and that was good, because nobody else attempted a second shot, that the guy must have had it, you know, but -- so when the column past, I suddenly had strength to pick myself up, and went into the forest, and found like minded people, other prisoners who escaped, having been lucky, not getting shot. So we huddled together and used the blanket in ma -- outside in -- in January in the forest with this -- just a cotton uniform, and I think we all slept, sitting, holding each other. And in the morning we went to the edge of the forest, that the road we came from, looking whether we find a sign where we are, what's happening. And we see the top of the hill another camp. The gate is open, no guard in the watch tower, and prisoners walking in and out. So inside the forest we ran -- suddenly we could not only walk, we could run, near to that camp, and we asked one of the prisoners, "Well what -- well what is this?" He said, "I don't know, but before dawn, all the Germans jumped into car -- into the trucks and took off." Didn't even take the time to liquidate the camp, with machine guns, and -- and hand grenades.</p><p>So what really happened, in that area, a Russian tank force cut a wedge into the German front. And of course they didn't want to be caught by the Russians, so they jumped in the trucks and left in a hurry. We -- I went into the camp, and saw guys from our camp. I said, "Where were you located?" Sort of the last block, because that was the last group that arrived there. And I found the two kids there, and we started to look for food, but we didn't find any, because those who were there already, they plundered the -- the -- the potato storage, and all -- all other storages. But somebody told us there's, on the side the road, is a abandoned village where the German population ran the same way as the SS, and there's food in their pantries. So we went there, not far, and there's food. Everything except bread. They must have taken the loaf and bread and ran. The speed at which they ran wa -- showed itself. That was unfinished food, even unfinished food on the table, and the rest was burned in the oven, or on top of the range. So we had food, and there was no -- at that time there was no refrigeration in Europe [indecipherable] I don't know, a few people may have had a refrigerator, and -- we want to break --</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I -- after I picked myself up from the ground, I was pr-pressing my arm against the wound, and lo and behold, among those in the forest was the French doctor.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. And anybody who has some function in a concentration camp has different degrees of privileges according to the degree of the function. And it must have been his privilege to have a pocket knife, which we were not allowed to have. And people see that around this time without other guys, just with snow as a somewhat numbing agent, and he had to make another hole because the bullet was away from where it entered. And he pulled it out, wriggling and wiggling. And I continued to do the same thing, holding my arm against the body until the blood dried, and -- and later on I started to take advantage of my profession, and -- by feeding myself, I gained enough healing power that it healed without bandages, without stitches.</p></p></dialogue>

People were -- had all kinds of preservation methods of food without refrigerator. So the first thing I found was a -- like a gallon jug glass jar, with roasted pork, covered with rendered lard, which prevents the -- the oxygen reaching the meat, and the meat therefore, does not spoil. And after months of Auschwitz diet, and three days absolutely nothing, I dug into that lard, and ate it like that. No bread, no nothing.

But it had a effec -- had it's effects. This was a huge place, the -- that camp was called Blechhammer, and it was part of a huge industrial complex. All the camp inmates were working in it -- of forced laborers from occupied countries were there, and POW's were also there, and were working. We found the camp of the British prisoners of war, and for some reason -- they were bombing London, but for some reason they were treating the British POW's very well. We found in that barrack warm uniforms, boots, socks, scarves, caps, coats, and a lot of toilet paper, which saved us from result of the way we were eating. There were 10 of us in -- in one of those barracks, there were two toilets, one on each end, and that wasn't enough. So they brought from the village, I don't know, somewhere, a huge half barrel, like a big whiskey barrel. I put two boards across so four could sit at the same time. That bad it was. I started to improvise cooking, and one guy was helping me, and eight did -- the rest of the 10, the eight went to town to bring supplies. The one kid I mentioned was working the carpentry shop in Terezin, he made a sled so more stuff could be brought. And there's one point he brought the whole - - took out from one of those houses a kitchen stove, including the pipes. He installed it, and then we were really cooking. The Russian soldiers came to eat, to us, because they didn't get food like that. It was another compliment for the aunt. And we're cooking till 10 in the evening, and by 10:15, there wasn't a bite to be had. That's how we ate. No -- no control. And the Russian soldiers told us how wonderful Communism is, everybody is even, and it's the best system, until a Jewish officer came, a Russian Jewish officer, said, "Don't believe a word." We were thinking of Communism, because that's a -- was presented to us as a real equal society, a society of equal people. But he set us straight.</p><p>We were six weeks in that British barracks, because between where we were, and our home, they were still fighting. You know, from the east front, we were here, and Prague was here, and the Russians were only getting there. So for six weeks we suffered terrible diarrhea. And in spite of it, I gained 79 pounds within six weeks, with my own cooking. I said -- what's her name, I fi -- know this -- this diet advertiser, Jenny Craig would have gone crazy if she heard that somebody gained 79 pounds in six weeks. And everybody -- after six weeks we moved out of there, and went to Katowice -- here come friend of the spelling. And they put us up in the schoolhouse where or -- other -- other form of prisoners were. And the Polish Red Cross gave us identification papers based on what we told them, because we didn't have anything to show. But we needed something because we were in the Russian occupied zone, and I don't know how long we were there. One of the tenant was a chemist, and he found a job in a smoke factory there, to earn some money. And next day he comes and says, "Come with me, they need a cook in the employees cafeteria, in the manager's restaurant." I have absolutely no recollection that I worked there, until I read one of the two kids memoirs, where he names the factory. So the name immediately sprang up, and I knew I know it. But even with that knowledge, I could not remember that I worked there. But I must have, because they all told me, and I brought food to the school for them. So -- and I don" know how long we were there.</p><p>Somehow time is not very noticeable, if you don't have a calendar, you don't have a routine, and that responsibility. Okay, and then we picked ourselves up and went home by means of freight trains, military trucks, horse-drawn carriages, walking. We were already strengthened -- strong by that time. The day we moved out from that British barrack, the diarrhea stopped like immediately. And our digestive systems started to work normally, cause we didn't eat like pigs any more. Oh, there was a -- and one story, and</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

So I found some -- a little hammer and a piece of rope, and we said we go down and get ourselves a pig with the sled. And I go there, and there were lots of pigs running around, and they were in the building. So I found one, tied a rope to his hind leg, and tied the rope to the -- to that column, the supporting column, and hit him on the head, that's how you kill pigs.</p><p>But the hammer was small, and I was not strong enough yet, and when you hit them here, it swells up and you can never break his skull any more. So it was screaming there, and suddenly we hear machine gun fire. I -- oh my God, the Germans are back. So we look out, and on top of that farm, a Russian column, military column pass by, and one was shooting the pigs with a machine gun, and they were throwing them at cars and trucks as they ro -- drove by. And the guy sees me with a knife, and commandeered me to about 12 or 13 pigs to eviscerate them. They want -- he want only the meat, not the innard. So I did that, and I said, "Now I worked for you, now you come and shoot my pig." And one of those wanted only the two hind legs, it was a [indecipherable] soldier. So we had one and a half pig, and a innards from a liver, and the organs from 12 more pigs. I don't even know how we brought it all on that sled. We were rendering the lard till 10 at night. And there was no worry about refrigeration, it was cold enough. So that -- we consumed all that -- I'm sorry -- okay, we started on our way home from Katowice, and we had to go -- I told you all the means we went, but I have to turn around to tell you -- to give you the direction. We were here, in Katowice. We went to the Ukraine, to Romania, to Hungary, Austria and Prague.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: There was meanwhile a quarantine in Terezin because some of the death marchers wor -- were brought near there, from Poland to Mauthausen, either through the Czech territory, or right outside, where Terezin was the nearest place, so they brought all these sick people in, including the dead. There was a crematorium in Terezin. They started first, when few people died, individual graves. My grandmother is in an individual grave. Then mass graves, without -- without coffins because the Germans wouldn't supply wood for that. And when that wasn't enough space for mass -- more mass graves, they built a crematorium, and the bodies were cremated. So I [indecipherable] was a quarantine, and people brought in typhoid, and scarlet fever, and all kind. And I must say, my wife, I don't know how she did it, they were friends from before, that's when they started to believe what happened. Her friends she has from before, one in one place with typhoid, one with the scarlet fever. This one couldn't eat, so she took his food to the other one, and she never got anything, and was lucky. I went home, and started to look for an apartment, and there was a -- you know, you couldn't like here go to someone, to a landlord and rent an apartment. That was all operated by a -- a housing cop -- not a cooperation, a state housing office. And they didn't come Tuesday, come Wednesday, come the afternoon, come day after. I said, "What the hell happened? The Jews didn't come back. The Germans you have expelled, what happened to the apartments?" I was too di -- naive and dumb to know that he wanted some -- something for the apartment. So it took almost two weeks before I lost my patience, and I took a chair and banged it on his desk, the desk collapsed, and I said, "And you are next." The -- "Wait, wait, wait, maybe we can find something." In the afternoon I had a apartment and I was mad at myself that I waited with this -- with this extended patience, that I waited that long, I could have had an apartment two weeks before. So then my parents came and -- thought you said you wanted this after -- at another time, or just so long -- as long as the tape runs?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, let's see, how -- how much more time do we have on the tape? Oh, well let's continue a little bit.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you bring -- do you bring your parents from Terezin?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I brought the parents from Terezin and now we -- I don't know where we got some furniture. Maybe the house -- th-the apartment was furnished, I don't remember the details. But I took two jobs because I needed to earn enough money for the three of us, and provide the things that we did not have after coming back from Terezin. So one job was where I took my apprenticeship, a day job, and then I worked in the evening in a restaurant where they also had the bar. And that -- there I worked at -- at night, and a lot of people who returned came to that evening restaurant and to the bar. And in October deg46 -- until October "46, when I was in inducted into the Czech army as a reserve, in the reserves, cause I was older than inducting age, for five months. And somehow, a United Nations request to the other states was to reduce the military, the numbers in -- of the people in the military.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, one of the friends whom I also met in Terezin after I came back, with a New Year's Eve party in her sister's apartment, and invited me. I don't know, I came only back from the military, how I found out there is a party, how she got to me, I don't remember that. But I know that I went, and Hana came with somebody, who was another fr -- childhood friend, who was much younger than she. A he friend, but not a boyfriend.</p><p>And also somebody who came back alone. So they went together, and I don't -- didn't know how tough it will be to live with her, but somehow I started a relationship with her.</p><p>And I -- I don't like dancing, but I thought it's what girl's like, so I invited her to dance.</p><p>And she called the other girl, in whose house we had the party. "Edgar wants us to come - - wants you to come to dance." And she said, "Well why didn't he call me directly?" She said, "I don't know what." So I was dancing with both of them, and I hate to dance, always did. But I thought it's -- you know, instead of the other introductory sentences.</p><p>And then the second time I said, "Would you like to come without a chaperone?" And somehow we did, and we had a relationship until, I think a few weeks, I don't know. I don't know about time, she -- she remembers better. She remembers even -- she said she could never -- you won't have a problem [indecipherable]. She even remembers what I supposedly promised 53 years ago. She still [indecipherable]. I have [indecipherable] cook, I want to be a good cook, and there was not much to cook with in Czechoslovakia after the war. So I wrote to the Swiss Chamber of Commerce that I would like to work there in the coming season, and I started in -- to work in Switzerland. But before we -- I went to Switzerland, there's another thing I don't like, I don't like movies, because I can sleep cheaper at home. And she insisted she wanted to go to a movie. I said, "I am not going," Yes, and she want -- I said, "If you want to go, you stand in line for the tickets." And she did, and she came with the ticket, and I said, "You know, maybe we should not go, and should go to your apartment, have some other kind of fun." And that was the end, she walked away, and I didn't see her until I came back from Switzerland.</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.
