<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: There was one surviving member of my mother's family, my cousin George,</p><p> who at that time was Ludzic(ph) Saltman(ph), who was interviewed by the</p><p> museum, and wrote a book, and you know, it -- it's easy to research him. He went</p><p> through camps from the time he was 12 to the time he was 17.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh my.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And when my mother heard that he had survived, of course, you know, she</p><p> brought him over. On my father's side, his brother survived, because he went into</p><p> Russia with the Red Army.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But his wife and 18 month old baby did not. The baby was lost, because</p><p> apparently they had arranged with Christian neighbors to take the baby, and could</p><p> never find the neighbors, never found the baby. So, big question mark.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And he would have been too young to know his name or background, if he had</p><p> survived.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But those were the only survivors of what were rather large families.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: There was a young woman, I think quite young, from Chicago, an American,</p><p> traveling from Germany with her birds. She went by ship because she ha -- she was</p><p> bringing birds home. She was an American, but she had lived in Germany for a</p><p> while. One day on deck I was swamped by a wave, and my leggings, or whatever I</p><p> wore, were soaked, and I was just standing there by myself helplessly, and I didn't</p><p> know what to do. And this young woman saw me, and took me to her stateroom,</p><p> and got me out of my wet leggings and gave me something dry to wear. And I</p><p> remember a stateroom full of colorful birds. Now, this is a four year old's memory.</p><p> It's perfectly possible that there were three birds. I just remember all these birds, ma</p><p> --Ihave no idea. And I believe she spoke German, so -- because she had lived in</p><p> Germany, so we communicated easily. And now here's the mystery. I slept in her</p><p> stateroom, and I don't know how that came to be, whether she talked to the people The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

She put me to sleep, and</p><p> she says, sweet dreams, and I said, I'm going to dream about my mother. And she</p><p> wrote that to my mother. So that clarifies that I really did sleep in her stateroom.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't know how much time I spent there. I know I was very, very fond of her,</p><p> and fascinated by these wonderful, colorful birds. And that's a major shipboard --</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The camp. The -- in -- there was a summer camp outside of Philadelphia where</p><p> we were kept. And from there we were supposed to go to foster care.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I'm not, I -- this is what I remember, but as a grownup, I think, wouldn't that be</p><p> strange, to have children on one side of a wire fence, and the people --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- looking them over on the other side? I don't -- but I remember this wire fence,</p><p> but it could be that I imagined it, I don't know.

And they couldn't publicize us</p><p> that much, because the idea of 50 Jewish children being brought to the States</p><p> wasn't that popular. So they had to do things a little quietly. So on one hand they</p><p> needed foster care for us, but it was difficult for them. And when people kept</p><p> wanting my brother, they thought it might be harder to place two children, and they</p><p> were going to separate us. And that is when my brother came into his full nine year</p><p> old powers, and absolutely refused, and you know, then when someone wanted to</p><p> take him, like if I don't go with my sister, I'm going to make your life miserable.</p><p> You won't want me in your house.

At one point there was -- I don't</p><p> remember the name of the town -- there was an article in the "New York Times,"</p><p> about a massacre of Jews in my father's town, which was close to PrzemysSl, but it</p><p> was another town. And my mother saw it and cut it out of the paper, she didn't want</p><p> him to see it from reading the paper.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think they -- there were news reports, they had a pretty good idea all along that</p><p> there would not be a surviving family. When my cousin survived, it was a great</p><p> surprise, you know, great joy. And she found it amazing that he could even</p><p> remember the name Tamar in New York City. But when he and his brother were</p><p> separated from their parents, the last thing his mother said to him, remember, Dr.</p><p> Tamar, New York City, you know. His mother and my mother were two years</p><p> apart, but almost looked like twins, they looked so much alike.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No kidding?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And when he saw my mother for the first time, it was very shocking to him,</p><p> because she looked so much like his own mother. He lived with us when he came,</p><p> and I became very, very close to him, He was 17, I was 13. And at that stage, I</p><p> knew more than I maybe should have about all details of the Holocaust, because he</p><p> talked very freely to me, and I listened. And -- but before I was 13, I knew what was</p><p> ha -- I knew why we had left Vienna, I mean --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: --I knew about the Holocaust. And I also, as my parents knew, that it was very</p><p> likely that no one would have survived.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I will say that when he wrote the book -- I mean, he wrote it out because his</p><p> children had asked, and he wrote with great pain and his wife told me that as he was</p><p> writing, tears were streaming down.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Sure.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And he's a sort of a tough guy, you know, but he wrote with tears streaming</p><p> down. But he, I think as an adult was more mellow. So the book -- some things in</p><p> the book are slightly more mellow than what he felt as a teenager.</p></p></dialogue>
