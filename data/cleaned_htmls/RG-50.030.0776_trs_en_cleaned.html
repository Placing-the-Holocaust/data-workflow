And because of my written tests that I took, plus the -- the training I got, I was --I--I---Icou--I could have become a -- an officer. At that time I have ant-anti-Semitism in the service, specifically in -- in the area that I was training as a tanker. And I had some anti- Semitinism(ph) involved, and because of that, I had an opportunity to go to headquarters of 42" tank battalion, and so that's what I did. And I became assistant to the adjutant there. And then, of course, we went overseas, and I went on -- and as I was -- I was -- I was transferred to the -- the headquarters as a clerk typist, and so that was my title, although I didn't - when we went overseas, I didn't do any typing or anything. I w -- I was the assistant to the adjutant and of course the battalion commander gave instructions -- wanted instructions to the -- the adjutant.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, what happened was, a -- a incident, for example, during the growing of th -- of the -- of the division, of the company, the battalions. People were transferring in and out, and there was a -- a Jewish soldier, Weinberg(ph), that transferred out, and the -- several of -- of the soldiers said good, we got rid of another Jew. At that point I said, "m Jewish. They couldn't understand. I didn't look Jewish, my name wasn't Jewish. And I says, well, you didn't -- you don't see the horns coming out? At any rate, I--I had a different feeling with -- with these soldiers, who were part of my tank -- tank company. And so I didn't feel comfortable going to officer training, coming back, and dealing with -- with anti-Semites in my outfit, fighting the Germans. So, that was -- that was why I transferred to the company. And course we didn't have any -- I didn't have to deal with any anti-Semitism while in the battalion headquarters. So that was -- that was the experience I had.</p></p></dialogue>
