<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Thank you. And your name was?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My name was the same, except I changed my first name; it was Fritz, and when I came to the United States, it was changed to Fred.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Otherwise we -- all names are the same, I-o-r-b-e-r.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Thank you. And can you tell me where and when your parents were born, along with their names?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. My father was born in 1898 in Nadworna, which is a small town in western Poland, and he left there just at the beginning, or before the start of World War I, and emigrated to Vienna. My mother was born of five children. Excuse me, my dad was of -- was one of two children -- two or three, and I don't quite recall. My mother was one of five, and she and her parents left Belz, b-e-l-z, Poland.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How old were your parents around one -- World War I?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My parents were in their late 30s. Excuse me, when -- you mean when they left?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Wh-When they got to Vienna.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They were very young. I think -- well, 1914 when the war broke out, so they were either 16 or 17 years old.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And how did they meet?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That is a puzzle. I don't know. I think that the Jewish population of Vienna was pretty large. I think the city itself was -- had a population of about two and a half million, and about 200,000 were Jewish. And so apparently the people that came from the same areas in the -- eastern Europe, because the Hapsburg Empire at that time was really large, before the first World War, and encompassed much of western Poland, and Czechoslovakia and went as far as down to northern -- what later became northern Italy. And so there was a lot of social activity going on, and I  <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion Interview with Fred Lorber deg December 2, 2011 really don't quite know how they really met. All I knew that I was a child that really be -- that came in 1923, so the war was over in 1918, so this was a very difficult economic time, and I -- not very much was talked about on how they met, and I really never found out.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did they speak --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I should have been much more inquisitive.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What -- what language did they speak with each other?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They spoke German and Yiddish. And my -- I think they both knew some Polish, but I don't think -- think -- because their schooling both was done in ger -- in German, because I think that the Austrian empire at that time went as far east as where they lived. And most of the Jewish populations in these small cities, either had a chayder, which was a religious school, where things were taught in Hebrew and in Yiddish. And then I think there was another school that I attended, which was in German.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: What kind of -- 0-obviously they were Jewish, what kind of religious backgrounds did they have? Did they have different tradition --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Ah, it was Orthodox.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Both of them?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Semi-Orthodox. Modern Orthodox.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Fred Lorber deg December 2, 2011</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Mod-Modern Orthodox?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, I guess.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did -- did they keep a different religious life as adults than they had -- had as children?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, we joined a synagogue in -- when I grew up. And I think that was rather late. At that time there were small, and I think it then continued also in the United States, there were little, itty-bitty storefronts, which functioned at high holidays, and a rabbi somehow, he was -- had another job, and then he conducted services at Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur; the two, you know, very important Jewish holidays.</p><p>And they were sometimes held at a storefront. But we belonged to a conservative synagogue in Vienna when I was growing up. I don't know what the sh -- really religious affiliations were before I was born. I just never really -- was so, I guess involved with the present time, and changes that took place culturally, and language- wise, and new locations, and all the things that took place that I think that the inquisitiveness was not there to find out how all these things really came to be.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What part of Vienna did you live in?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In the 20" district, which was a -- Vienna had 21 districts, the first district was the inner city, where all the [indecipherable] buildings, museums, and the opera  <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Fred Lorber deg December 2, 2011 and all the public buildings were and the -- was in central Vienna, and it -- even though it was the 20" district, it -- it joined the second district, which was very -- it had a very substantial Jewish population. The 20" district also had a good size -- well, not so [indecipherable] but had a sprinkling of Jewish population. And it was next to the second district and the first district. So, it was pretty close within the inner city, even though the numbers really were the disparity.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: What kind of socio-economic groups lived there? Was this a middle class, a merchant --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Middle class. I would say middle class.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And what -- what was your -- did -- did both of your parents work, or only your father?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, my mother never worked. My father worked for a fairly large manufacturing company of textiles, who had plants in Czechoslovakia. They made tablecloths and towels and other linens, and their headquarters was in the first district in Vienna, and he was one of the sales -- started out as one of the salesmen, later became the sales manager for the company for Vienna.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you recall the company's name?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. Heinrich Klinger, k-I-i-n-g-e-r.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was on Rudolfplatz(ph) and at least the significant, it stands out in my mind, because the Gestapo later on was kind of cattycorner from -- there's a square, they were on a kind of a small square, if I remember, with trees, and some -- a few benches, and diag -- di-- dial -- diagonally -- diagonally? Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: There was a hotel, kind of a meet -- it wasn't a luxury hotel, but it was a -- it was a good sized hotel called the Metropole Hotel, which later became the SS headquarters and the Gestapo headquarters for -- for Austria. And I'II refer to it later on, because it did play a part in our lives.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- estimate on that. I think he started working there at the end of -- or the beginning of peace, 1919 or 1918, and then became the sales manager, as I mentioned before, I think, for the -- for the company, for the city of Vienna.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Fred Lorber " December 2, 2011</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay. Were you born an Austrian citizen?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. So your parents would have had Austrian citizenship by the time you were born?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, yes, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Can you describe a little bit about your childhood memories of school, school friends?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was it an integrated group, did you go to a Jewish school?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. I went to -- the first part I went to called a Volksschule, which is first four grades, and did very -- from what I understand, I did very well. Not because I was so smart, but I think the competition wasn't very great -- it was in a neighborhood school, in a very traditional school building. It was, as a matter of fact, when I visited Vienna later on, it was still there, and I -- really, I think I was a little bit of teacher's pet, because my parents always got very good reports. I don't quite remember the names of the teacher, but there was a close relationship. In other words, a respect between my parents and the teachers of that school, and I did come out pretty well academically.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And this was a public school?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: From there I went to gymnasium, which is a kind of semi-private, or it was really the track up to the university. And --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Do you recall which one it was? The name of the school?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, Ul-Ultaberg(ph) gymnasium. It was named after the street it was on, it was next to a very large well-known park called the Augarten, and it wasn't very far away from where we lived; I would walk to school. I took a-- used to take me about probably 25 or 30 to 30 fo -- maybe 40 minutes, every day.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And the school did not have a religious denomination?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They had a religious -- they had a -- Catholics had a priest come in and the class was separated at that time, twice a week, I think, maybe an hour each time. The same thing, we had a Jewish rabbi that came in, the students would be pulled out, the Jewish students, and took religious in-instruction. I think that still is the German way of doing things, I think they still do that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you recall -- sorry -- do you recall how many Jewish students went to your grade?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, my class had a number of Jewish students, because the neighborhood, you know, where we lived did not have many Jewish people, but there were maybe three  <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Fred Lorber 0 December 2, 2011 to four families on one large city block, or a couple of city blocks. And further [indecipherable] one fur-further toward the center of the city, the Jewish population became much larger. So, we did have an -- quite a good part, I would say 30 percent of the students must have been Jewish.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Now what years --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: The boys were separated from the girls, and I mentioned before that a rabbi would come in twice -- I think once or twice a week, and the Jewish students would be separated again, and would take Jewish instruction.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And now what years were you at the gymnasium?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: What year was | at the gymnasium?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Ah, let's figure that out. Had to be from 1930 f--- let's see, I was born in "23, so six -- four -- in 10 years, when I was 10 or 11 years old, I went on to gymnasium from Volksschule. So I would assume I must have been 11.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay, so isn't that 1934?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. And you were at the gymnasium until when?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: First four. So 1934 through 1938.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That is -- so 1938, and when the Nazis took over in March of 1938, by May they told us the Jewish students could no longer go to any public or semi-private school in--in Vienna.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay, now I --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And I got kicked -- in other words, all the students got kicked out.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay. Now da --I--I just want to go back a little bit --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Sure.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- to the 30s. Do you have -- do you have memories of 1933? Do you have any memories of your parents discussing the Nazi party's rise to power in Germany?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And what are those?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The -- it's -- what stands out in my memory, and it sometimes fades out, but I still remember, in 1938 -- January of 1938, at that time the German and Austrian schools  <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Fred Lorber " December 2, 2011 had a winter vacation. In Austria, their national sport is skiing, and soccer. And I was just -- I was put on skis at only six years old. So, I was with my school on a winter vacation at -- at some of the mountains, the [indecipherable] kind of not the Alps, but kind of the foothills of the Alps for one week with my school, skiing -- for a skiing vacation. And it was -- had to be January of 1938. I still remember it because I wa -- I participated in a ski race, and I won kind of a little trophy, and I was very proud of it, and I -- but by the second run or whatever it is, I ken -- I had a bad fall, or whatever it was, and I kind of dislocated my thumb, and I remember that.</p><p>So, when my parents picked me up at the railroad station, coming back from that school vacation, they seemed at edge, and explained to me that things were not doing very well. They had received information and in contact with some friends or relatives in Germany -- and as you know, Hitler took over 1933, and at that time, the Nuremberg laws, which this qualified and you know, makes the Jews of Germany not only second class, but third and fourth class citizens and they lost their jobs, particularly if they were government jobs, or sensitive jobs like movies, or livit -- or publishing and things like that, the discrimination really was beginning to really hurt in Germany, and my parents were very much aware of it.

And it was, if you go back into history, there was a chancellor of Austria, his name was Schuschnigg, and he represented the -- kind of a little bit of a also -- I would say little bit a of a dictatorship, but not as strongly as what the Nazis had. He represented the Christian Austrian Christian party, which was the -- the Conservative party. Vienna's representation was more social democratic, and my father was involved in the social democratic party. And at that time there were all kinds of demonstrations in Vienna. The Nazis had become determined again that they were, since 1934 the Nazi party was outlawed in Germany -- in Austria, because they had tri-tried to have a putsch, and overthrow the government. They killed Dollfuss, who was a chancellor, in tr -- in trying to do it, but that was aborted, and the Austrian government was able to arrest and -- and kill some of the people who tried to overthrow the government, and this -- and that time outlawed the Nazi party. So, in 1938, the beginning, the negotiations were going on between the pr -- the president of Austria and Hitler. He would summon him -- Hitler would summon him to Berchtesgaden and really threaten him with all kinds of bad things, and scream at him, and was looking to annex Austria to Germany. And the guy stood firm, Schuschnigg did, for a while. So all this demonstration of voting for annexation to Austria, or Austria re-remaining independent, took place in the beginning of 1938.

And one was same age as I, and one was a year and a half younger. And they were very di -- they, at very young, were very involved in Hashomer Hatzair, which was a left wing of the Zionist movement in Austria. And I used to also belong to that youth group. I'd go occasionally. I wasn't this vehement about it that -- as my two cousins, to whom I was very close. And we would sometimes walk together.

My parents kept me at home. We didn't know what to really expect. Things on the radio, you know, warned you -- there wasn't any private radio, or the radio was controlled by the government, there was one station. No TV, of course, and we were told to stay at home. There were all kinds of warnings given out. The -- I think it must have been on a Saturday, and the German army marched in.</p></p></dialogue>

The [indecipherable] friends I had lived next district, in the second district, what a -- 18" district, or -- or were school friends that did not live where I lived. So there was one or two Jewish, I think one that I was close to. I still remember his name, Leo Schickler(ph), and we were kept at home tha-that day. So, things changed very rapidly. I was told that our school would stop; Jewish kids would no longer go to school after summer vacation. I mean, July, we -- we were all kicked out. At -- what happened at that particular time, the -- the immensity of the political change really did move very fast, but it was not at that to -- time, life threatening. It wasn't a point that I would get beat up on the street, or would get arrested. So, what really happened to begin with, that small Jewish businesses, of which there were many in -- in Vienna, you know, haberdashery stores, or grocery stores, or what the case may be, all the graffiti was to be painted on their windows, don't buy here, Juden, it would say, or they would have the star Jew -- you know, Star of David painted on the windows, or they would -- they would put an SA guy as a Brownshirt, you know, semi-military person in front of the store and discourage people from walking in.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I would tra -- yes, they would -- I would be threatened, or I would be beat up, or would had some confrontation, and I tried to avoid that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was that because they knew who you were, or was there a way of recognizing you?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They would, you know, call me names, dirty Jew, or this and that. And at this time I was very sensitive to that. I had --I did have a number of non-Jewish friends who were very -- who really stuck with me, very early in the game.

But my mother was not very happy that I would go to places I shouldn't be.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What kind of places?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I wasn't allowed to go to a movie, and I did sneak in a few times. I-I think there are certain places that -- where Jews were not allowed, a park. I did not sick on a park -- I did not sit on a park bench until that episode I mentioned. And I was very sensitive and really very careful on how -- what my behavior was, and that almost any time I walked or went someplace, I was very, very -- I knew I was very vulnerable, and I was very careful about doing things.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: This heightened sense of vulnerability, did this only, well, grow after Kristallnacht, or where you already quite sensitive before?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, how do I - okay, there was a famous Jewish -- that's not -- I'm sorry, famous German author called Karl May. Ever hear of him?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: He wrote 64 books, each one four, five, 600 pages, I've -- I think I read every one of them. And he wrote about America and about the Indians and the trappers and the west -- the American west, the -- he had heroes like Winnetou and Old Shatterhand --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yes, I am -- I am familiar with those books.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="45"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 49 Interview with Fred Lorber December 2, 2011</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Okay. I read every one of the books. And it -- he really -- and the guy never left Germany. He -- all out of his head. As a matter of fact, two of my friends and I, we decided to revisit some of our last -- was it two years ago, we went to Paris and Berlin and -- and Vienna, and doing kind of some spots from the second World War, and they're both veterans. And we stopped in Berlin for a week, and they had an ex -- they had a special exhibition at one of the museums, the city museum of Berlin, of Karl May. He was a faker, you know, but he wrote the books that to this very day are very popular, a hundred years later, still very popular in Germany. It's all about America, the American west, Indians and trappers and the whole thing. So I was big fan of that. As a matter of fact, once one of my teachers asked my mom to come to school because te -- she felt I was reading too many of those books. So I had that little adventure seed planted into me. So it became a game to me a little bit, of avoiding being -- you know, meeting someone that -- with whom I would have a confrontation. And having -- and living in an area which there were mostly non- Jews. I was used to that, and the people were somewhat protective of us wher-where we lived. I don't ever remember being threatened or -- except that one thing of our cleaning lady coming and then demanding money from my mom.</p></p></dialogue>

She was a gutsy lady, she was very smart. And not because she was my mom, and I'1I -- it'1l come as I tell you my story, but she -- she had her -- her feet on the ground almost all the time. She never panicked. And there was plenty of opportunities to panic.</p></p></dialogue>

Go and see that film that -- that is -- you have in your library, about Vienna. It's a 10 minute film -- if I have it handy here -- no, it's -- it's someplace here in my office.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>And, I could look at it. And you have it. And it shows you the enthusiasm, and the -- this is in March of 19 -- or April second of 1938 when Hitler first comes back into Vienna and -- and the whole town goes berserk. So you have this -- the ab -- the unbelievable propaganda machine working with such efficiency and dedication to turn the whole culture around. This was the ability that they were able to do. I mean, if you go -- you were in an environment where you see all the shoes and all the luggage and all the boxcars and -- in your mu -- in the museum.

So you see that tremendous change that takes place within people that just -- to this very day I don't quite understand it, how a normal, civilized people go and kill people, or put them into a gas chamber.</p></p></dialogue>

Now, to be a big shot in the Nazi party, you had to be an -- a member of the Nazi party for a long time, during the time that it was illegal. So this guy must have been -- for many years been a Nazi, which doesn't sit very pleasant with us -- pleasantly. So we came back, I think a week or two later, and he found out that if we could go to that -- he found out who has responsibility of the Dachau inmates that were arrested in Vienna, and it's an SS officer that has a desk at the Metropole Hotel in first district on Rudolfsplatz(ph) and he was going to make an appointment with -- for my mother to meet this officer, and find out what has to be done, if we could get my father out of camp. He said to us that we, I think, have to show proof that we would leave within a very short time. So where would we go? You know, Europe at that time, almost every border was closed. My mother had an ex -- old  <span class="page-break" number="56"></span> Interview with Fred Lorber degdeg December 2, 2011</p><p> boyfriend who was English Jewish person, that she was, I think seeing romantically, or just a good friend, before she married.

And there was a question about getting a visa that was -- visas sold illegally by a embass -- a Chinese embassy official who -- who wasn't supposed to do it, but sold permits to go to Shanghai from Vienna, and also, it was done out of Germany. So that's, you know, a number of people, Jewish people landed up in Shanghai, and later found out they were -- they -- they sold those to make money, and it was not a policy of the Chinese government. But the -- they did s-save a number of Jewish families.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was this through any organization, any charitable organization?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: It was kind of a unofficial done, you know, that things happened when -- when panic strikes, that people find ways of doing things. It was not official. I don't think it was an organization like HIAS or anything like that. Be -- was that somebody had re -- a relative in -- in New York, and -- who had money, or was willing to help this person living in Vienna who had no money. So they would say if -- if the official exchange of marks -- used to be shillings and then it became German marks, was five marks to the d-- 10 marks to the dollar -- I've forgotten what the exchange rate was, the black market would pay 20 marks to a person in -- in Vienna, instead of 10.</p><p>So it paid for the relative to deal to that black market, or whatever it was called, to that conduit. And so if you had money and you lived in Vienna, and you -- there were Jewish people who had no money, and they need to buy groceries. And they had relatives that would give -- who would contribute some money.

I see this guy looks familiar walking across the common and I recognize, oh my God, that's Irving Geringer. I si-- hollered at him, Irving, Irving, is that you? Sure enough he turns around, it's him. He -- he was a brilliant guy; I think his I.Q. must have been 160 or so, and they put him as the historical section for the Fifth Army. So we landed -- we move -- when we are shipped overseas into North Africa and then into Italy, he also got shipped over, and he ran the historic section for the Fifth Army, so he wrote a book about the campaign.

And it was until -- we stayed there -- the war started September first, and we're still in Vienna, and things got to be worse. I think they began to issue us permits to buy food.

Things were really heating up, they ge- getting worse. The Nazi takeover of Jewish businesses was going on and -- much, much more ra-rapidly. Less and less Jewish business existed, you know, with graffiti on their windows, they were all taken over. People lost their fortunes. Rich people were able to get out very early, the Rothschilds, and whoever they all -- the other people were, the Blochs(ph) and so on. And they took over their palaces and their facilities and confiscated most of their wealth and paintings, and I -- really got tough.</p><p>And in the meantime my dad would go out to the police, get an extension. And we would go pretty often to -- not I, but mom and dad -- to the American embassy to find out where we were on that list. It looked more and more that we had a chance to really go to America. And finally, our visa came -- not visa, but our number came up, and we were able to get the visa in November to departure in that wa -- I think it came up in October, for us to leave in November.

And si-- never did I ever have the desire to start -- we put together -- some people did, I just didn't, and my parents did -- didn't. We want to get rid of this whole history, and we should have really kept so many things that would have been very valuable today, to create my story.

And Italy at that time was not in the war. It declared -- they went on the side of Germany, | think, three or four months later, or whatever it was, I don't remember. And we went on this very beautiful ship, I -- it was very luxurious, except that they put -- I stayed with my dad in a cabin, and my mom was with other women. And there were -- there are other, one or two other women, and they overburdened the ship. In other words, to try to put the -- put as many people on it as they could, many of whom were refugees like us. And we landed in New York in November, I don't remember the date. And my -- our  <span class="page-break" number="73"></span> ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion Interview with Fred Lorber u December 2, 2011 relatives were at the dock. I never forgotten, never, that in-- I was always thankful that the ship did not dock. It stayed outside the harbor in New York City. And Europe at that time was in [indecipherable] blacked out. Couldn't think of it. There were no lights at night. Cars had no headlights, they had slits on their headlights, and it was -- there were no public, no streetlights, no nothing. The war was on, they were always afraid of bombings, so every light at night at -- wherever it was, whether it was Berlin or Vienna or anyplace else, were totally, totally blacked out. And a ship docked, came there in the evening of whatever that date was in November, and it docked on the other side that later became the Verrazano bridge. And you saw the tip of Manhattan, the skyscrapers or the tip, the Woolworth buildings and -- all lit up. It was totally disbelief. I stood out there on the dock and it was cold, and seeing New York City all lit up; it was unbelievable. And next morning we passed the Statue of Liberty, I shall never forget that. It was the most glorifying day of my life, and I became an American overnight, emotionally, at that particular time. I -- so we landed in New York, and we moved in with our friends who were -- lived in the same building in Vienna, who got and had many relatives, cousins and brothers and sisters lived in New York.

I never really even thought about that, because we came, you know, we were immigrants. We were -- we had to reestablish ourselves. So it was either we did it and everybody worked, or you just -- you became a dependent -- or even that not being citizen, I don't know whether or not there was money available, like unemployment or things like that, and I don't think so. So if you were going to have your self-respect, and made a livi-- you know, knew that you had to make an honest living, you had to go to work. And to get a job, I think my dad or my mom would not been able to do that, because they're very limited on their English language at that time. And they picked it up, you know, as they start working in the store. And many of their customers were -- were Jewish, and they spoke Yiddish. And, it was a very Jewish neighborhood.</p></p></dialogue>

I went to -- then I also bought -- I left the company after I was president and bought an interest in another company, and I s-started another company with a couple of immigrants, Russian immigrants, which they still work -- still running here in -- in I-- in Des Moines, now owned by a large syndicate, and has about 300 employees.

One wife was a physician and the other wife a concert pianist.</p><p>And I was taken with them immediately, because I somehow superimposed myself into their situation, I guess: new immigrants, well-educated, talented.

One wife was a physician, the other wife a pianist, a -- played at the Kir-Kirov-Kirov -- Kirov Opera Company in Leningrad, at that time, now St. Petersburg. And -- and I got to be very close to them, because these were the first immigrants we -- that the Jewish community took on upon themselves to settle them. We got them an apartment, we -- I got them English teachers, and found jobs for them. A friend of mine that was president of a steel company here and also was Jewish, I called him up and I says, you got -- you know, got to help me. I have these two Russians, they very -- look like very smart engineers, they don't speak much English, I need jobs for them. So he gave them the jobs. And I got fairly close to them, and my associates at the business that I just was buying in, there's a father and son who owned that company, it's a company that was making quilted nylon fabrics in Des Moines and had another plant in Arkansas, Magnolia, Arkansas.

So I met with them, and they showed me patents, but I couldn't read them as done in Cyrillic Russian, and -- but I could make out their names.

So we became very good friends and we got them their patents and then my three -- two partners and I put in each 25,000 dollars to get them rolling.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So Irving was --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And we kept our friendship right through the war, and we were very close while we lived in New York. His father became the concertmaster at the -- which is the first chair in the orchestra -- at the Metropolitan Opera Company. And so we went to the opera very often, for free. And became kind of a steady guy at the Metropolitan Opera -- that's when they were still down on 1407, which is 1407 Broadway, and then they moved uptown to Lincoln Center, and we did -- I still remember going, how amazed we were [indecipherable] opera company, Irving and I did. We were -- became very good fre -- I gotta tell you a quick anec -- ac -- anecdote. Not anecdote, thing that happened to him and me. When the war ended, I moved up from Italy into -- of - U-USF -- US -- US force -- USFA. US Forces in Austria.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>They apparently went through my -- through, you know, my -- every G.I. had that IBM card. I didn't have it, but they had it. We traveled with trucks in the wors -- in worse environments, that had the first machines, IBM cards, they were -- had holes in them. And they had these machines in the trucks, they're big, big -- they were  <span class="page-break" number="105"></span> Interview with Fred Lorber mn December 8, 2011</p><p> very big semis. And -- and you -- all your -- your record and who you are, your names, your schooling, your I.Q., whatever you did, was on that one card, it had holes in it. So if they want to pull the -- that the army wanted to pull you up, because looking for certain specialties that people may have, they would somehow run these cards through these machines, and it'll come up. So, when the war ended, my outfit was moved -- was going to be moved back to the States, but then they redirected it to Japan -- not to Japan, but to the Pacific. So, I got pulled out, and I always wondered how -- why didn't I go with my outfit? So apparently my Viennese birth and my German knowledge, I landed up in US Forces in Austria, on the mar -- on the [indecipherable]. Then, he was the commanding general of the campaign in -- in Italy, that went from the bottom of the boot all the way up to the Po River, where I served all my military overseas. So then my friend Irving wrote the book about the campaign, the Italian campaign. So, I-I find myself pulled out and sent to a staging area and then I get orders that I am now part of USFA ma -- US Forces in Austria. So I am the only really Viennese person in a contingent of about 200 - 300 G.L.s that will make the invasion back in -- not invasion, but because the Russians got there before us, but reoccupation of Vienna. I -- did I tell you that yet?</p></p></dialogue>

That was like where you waited, and then, for example, the third division, or the 45" or 36", that was -- is a fighting position in Italy. When they had casualties they would put in a request for replacements. So that's what I was trained to be, a replacement. So, on the way, to figure out that we're going overseas, from Hampton Roads, Virginia, they find out I'm not a citizen, the army. So they take me in Pennsylvania -- we were a staging area, Camp Shenango, I still remember that. And they find a federal judge -- I'm only in this country four years and to be a citizen you have to be here five years, to be naturalized.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were there any friendships between the G.I.s and the locals, or were you moving too fast for anything?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. There were friendships -- not friendships, no. And that's what bothered me somewhat, and I think maybe I had an extraordinary sensitivity to that. The Germans -- the -- the -- the Italians were -- the G.L.s called them guineas or wops.</p><p>They called the Germans krauts, they called the French, the frogs, and I -- bothered me a great deal. It was insulting. And I always wondered -- that was the one minus that I always felt that we did not do a good job to -- in other words, the American G.I. had a great sense of superiority, emotionally, and looked down on almost anybody that wasn't American. And I was sensitive to that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you were not partaking in that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. I--I felt I could not call an Italian with any kind of a name but Italian. Same thing I didn't call any German a kraut. It was -- I'll give you an example. My son- in-law, married to our youngest daughter, who is dean of this law school in -- they're Californian, and his father, my son-in-law's dad, was a major or colonel in the tank corps. And he divorced -- they divorced -- in other words, my -- had five children and he divorced his wife, in California, and married a German woman.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="122"></span>  127 Interview with Fred Lorber December 8, 2011 And we used to see them occasionally, you know, when we went to California we'd see the mother, and then we'd see the father, you know. I don't know if I make myself clear.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, sure.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And he used to call his wife the kraut. She was born in Germany, and she was a war bride. It always bothered me and I once -- I'd never really -- I was going to talk to him about this, but I never really felt I wanted to get into that kind of involvement. So, I felt the same way, that I didn't want to diminish people's -- what -- cultural background, even though they were the enemies, I didn't -- they were Germans.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Sure.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And kraut does -- somehow did not really fit their ch -- in my opinion, they were -- they were -- they were Germans. They were -- I -- the concentration camps were -- guards were Germans, the Nazis were Germans. And if would call them krauts, I would somehow diminish their -- even their evil --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I understand.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- of what they did.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I understand.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't know if I make myself clear.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="123"></span> Interview with Fred Lorber a December 8, 2011</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Absolutely. Absolutely.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So I looked at them as who they were. I interrogated some, when they needed someone to speak to a prisoner or two. And everybody told me they weren't Nazis.</p><p> I never found a Nazi. But they all lied. They were always very [indecipherable] but I did the -- later on, toward -- when I was in Austria | did interrogate some SS people. So that's [indecipherable]</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And I do want -- I do want to talk about that more, but let's just -- let's just finish the Italian chapter then.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In Italy, you're there until May or June of 44, and -- okay, so what happens in May or June?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, at wh-wha -- when -- when do you leave Italy, and for what reason?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh. I was in northern Italy, I moved up from Naples, from -- into some other town, two little towns, I don't even remember their names. And when the war ended, I was much in northern Italy, not far from the Po River, and I forget the little town that we were in. I wish I'd remember, and I didn't keep records of these</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="124"></span> </p><p> 129 Interview with Fred Lorber December 8, 2011 things. And I remember [indecipherable] for some reason I -- we -- I landed up before that at -- at the Adriatic, and I have to look at the map to see what the name of the town was that I was in, because most of the time I was over of the Mediterranean part of Italy. So I get pulled out of my outfit, and get into a -- and I don't quite remember all that, how -- where I landed up, it's someplace that I disliked the master sergeant that seemed to have no combat experience or any else, had just come from the u -- from the States. He was a regular army guy, never really participated in any of the combat situations [indecipherable] it all back, and he just had come to northern Italy. And he tried to tell all these guys that had been there for two years or more how they should behave, you know, like back in the States, very GL.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Now was it -- was it a behavior -- was it a discipline, or was it fraternizing --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Discipline, you know --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Discipline?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- get up in the morning and stand at attention and count off numbers and things he didn't do any more, things that were done in basic training. And this guy, this master sergeant insisted on it. So it was a lot of -- a lot of complaints about it, and they finally stopped it and they kind of got rid of this guy. And I waited there for --  <span class="page-break" number="125"></span>  130 Interview with Fred Lorber December 8, 2011 and I wasn't quite sure what my assignment was going to be, when I heard I was now part of US forces in Austria.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Now, prior --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: But before that my --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- prior to that, you had never been asked to used your German for the arm --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Beg your pardon?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Prior to that --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: They never used -- they never, ever -- this is the first time that my IBM card came up --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- with that information apparently, because otherwise I would have gone with my outfit and left Italy when the war ended. So I land up, and they tell me I am now part of General Mark Clark, who was the commanding general, of whom I knew his aides because I traveled with them most of the time in Italy, the headquarters of the Fifth Army. That's where I was ass -- really originally assigned to. So it was kind of surprising to me. And once I get an order and tell that I'm -- we're going into -- travel into Salzburg, which is a beautiful place.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Had you ever been there as a child?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: So he tells me, oh, you're going to Salzburg.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Other parts were British, and little parts were French and most -- and Vienna was all under the Russians.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did the Austrians --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Beg your pardon?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did the Austri -- did the Austrians fear the Americans? Was this -- was there any kind of sense that they were worried about what was coming?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No? You mean, the Americans, or the -- the Germans?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: The -- the -- the Austrians, the locals around Salzburg. Was there any feeling --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, there was [indecipherable] yes, they were very -- I think they were very vulnerable. The ec -- the economics were pretty bad. Food was not easily available.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>The -- the natives kind of did not really have a high profile, they kind of stuck to their homes. And you know, they saw the Nazis behavior. And I think there was a certain amount of submerged -- whatever they tell you that they didn't know what was going on with the concentration camps and the gassing and all this, they knew it. So, I think in their own psyche, they felt this basic sense of insecurity, because the German army, and the Austrian army, though it really was really part of the  <span class="page-break" number="134"></span>  139 Interview with Fred Lorber December 8, 2011 German army -- and you know, if you go back in the history, more Austrians were associated with the concentration camps than Germans. They were probably the worst anti-Semites. So you felt very, very -- I think they were -- they themselves knew what they did, and kept a low, low profile. And so, I really -- my opportunity to talk to local people was really not that big.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm. Were there any American G.I.s who were somehow using their status or their power for nefarious goals?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, I don't know. The -- there -- there was no questioning about the occupation.</p><p>The United States moved in there very -- with lock, stock and barrel. I mean, we had everything. We had food, we had -- you know, had PXs, we had -- we took over the best hotels. We were -- we were the conquerors. And we had strong feelings of superiority, subconsciously and consciously.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And di--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: So we made these people feel pretty small, you know, that's -- and they if -- and the worse they behaved during the war, I think the more afraid they were.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was there any fraternization with Austrian women?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, some. Wer -- I never had any. I'm trying to think why I never had any. I hand a girlfriend at home, and I was corresponding with her almost on a daily basis.</p><p>You know [indecipherable] V -- V-letters. She's -- my wife is a very wonderful  <span class="page-break" number="135"></span> </p><p> 140 Interview with Fred Lorber December 8, 2011 writer. She has a fantastic ability. She really should have been an author. She never really pursued it, but she wrote the most beautiful letters. So I really was very much in love with her. And so really I had no -- ever had any kind of relationship with any woman. I'm trying to think -- not even, you know, I spoke the language.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And I never -- I never -- never occurred to me. And the other thing, I think -- okay, I will tell you a story that -- well, I don't know if I should really -- okay. The -- the -- somehow, I had a sense of -- was it discipline or morals or ethics, or whatever you may want to call it, instilled to me by my parents. There was no deviation. I never messed around with any woman. And -- except one time. And that later came, before going home, that I had to get up on ship -- I mean, I had no -- no relationships, but I got involved into a situation in Marseilles, France, which was very strange. Now, if we have time Ill tell you about it --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Oh, we have plenty of time.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- and promise not to put it into my biography.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, no.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because it was so unusual, yeah, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Sure.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="136"></span> </p><p> 141 Interview with Fred Lorber December 8, 2011</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And -- and my wife, you know, everybody, all of my friends know that story, my wife knows the story. But anyways, up to that time, there wasn't anything that -- that really I felt was -- somehow it never appeared, I -- I can't remember. I can remember why I never had any attraction to any of the German or Austrian women, or Italian women. I did make the acquaintances of one Jewish woman in Naples, and she was a violinist, and the only thing that we had was my love for music and her talent.</p><p>And I went to her -- with her a few -- she was Jewish and she was a violinist and she gave recitals, and I went with her while I stayed in Naples, up to a few of her recitals. And that was a f-- one woman that I met and I helped her out a little bit with food, what they were very short on at that particular time, with her mother.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: In Salzburg, were there G.I-s helping out the local Austrians with food, or was that --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yeah, I think so. The -- the women in Austria, particularly in Vienna.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>Vienna was starved for men, because they either were in prisons, they were in stalags, or they were in -- killed. And it was a shortage of male people when I got into Vienna. The G.I.s were just having a ball.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So let's talk about getting into Vienna. How did that happen?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So, the Russians finally said okay, you come in. So that time was springtime, and my -- one of my -- and I can't -- a-all I remember, this guy and I were assigned  <span class="page-break" number="137"></span> </p><p> 142 Interview with Fred Lorber December 8, 2011 to this Jeep, or this Jeep was assigned to us. And we were in Linz at that time, which was the border between -- we were waiting for the opportunity to get into -- across the Russian zone. And they finally -- th-- we negotiated that -- I didn't, but you know, the army did, and got the signal to drive into Vienna and to take over certain da --I got places, and a list of places that we should take over, at which hotel we should stay, and some apartments that were at one time held by some Nazi functionaries, to take over for our incoming troops. And only about 200 Americans to be -- that were going into the first occupation. I think that's what the number was, but don't pin me down on it, but I don't quite remember. So we got into our Jeep and got our stuff in the back. And I remember picking up a -- a Russian officer, and we offered him some cognac, and he -- I think he drank that whole bottle, we just couldn't believe it. And we got into Vienna at about -- oh, must have been after lunch, something like one o'clock or so, and the place was very few people. What happened as we drove through the -- from the suburbs in, that every time there was some people walking and they saw us, they would duck into the closest building, where the doors were open maybe, you know, the gates.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Apparently, they thought we -- we didn't have much -- I don't think we had any American flag painted on our Jeep, or our uniforms didn't -- weren't very  <span class="page-break" number="138"></span> </p><p> 143 Interview with Fred Lorber December 8, 2011 recognizable. I wore fatigues, so did my buddy. And I had my helmet packed in a bag, in my barracks bag, and -- and on our way in I say to this fellow in the camp, he was from -- near Cincinnati -- Covington -- coving -- Covington, Kentucky. I says, I want to take you to my old neighborhood where I grew up. Want to do that?</p><p>He says, absolutely. So we -- we -- we kind of turned the Jeep into that direction.</p><p>It's like the suburb -- not suburb, but next to the first district was where our district was, not far walking distance to where the opera is, and the Ringstrasse -- you ever been in Vienna?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Have you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. Yes, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You did? So, not far. Even though it's the 20" district, it was very close to the first district. We drive up on our street where our buil -- where we sh -- we s -- lived in an apartment house, and didn't see a soul. And there's certain -- several buildings had been shelled. There were holes in them, big ones, and probably nobody living in them. But my -- our building was not damaged, and -- and the buildings across the street were not damaged. And we pulled our Jeep up, and it -- when places have been shelled, that -- kind of a funny silence, there's no birds singing, or things like that, and it was spring -- it was late spring, the beginning of summer, I think. And  <span class="page-break" number="139"></span> 144</p><p> Interview with Fred Lorber</p><p> December 8, 2011</p><p> we pulled up, and I showed this guy, my buddy what -- second floor up here, he look up and that's where our apartment was. I wonder if we can go in there, in the building, then -- maybe the front -- the gate was open, and see who lives there, who took over our apartment, and -- and what it looks like. And just about when we're discussing this, and no people, this place is empty, a woman comes out of the building that we lived in, and she's carrying a pail. And there's, across the street from the building, an -- a lot of cobblestones in Vienna, and -- it's an old city. And she keeps her head down, because she sees these two soldiers sitting in this open Jeep, and there have been a lot of rapes before we got there, by the Russians [indecipherable]. But she's an elderly woman. And keeps her head down, but she looks -- turns it and looks at us, and I had my -- I don't have my hat on. I recognize her, who she was. She was a neighbor of ours. And she looks, and all of a sudden, she drops the pail [music -- phone ringing] who is this? That's my wife, hold on a second.</p></p></dialogue>

Yes, so be -- I know, okay, all right. She's telling me "m tying up the phone. Okay, I know. Anyways, we get this -- wrong part for her to do it. Well, we're going to conclude. So anyways, she looks and recognizes me -- and I  <span class="page-break" number="140"></span> ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion 145</p><p> Interview with Fred Lorber</p><p> December 8, 2011</p><p> have curly hair -- and she drops the pail and screams my name. And all of a sudden --and she comes rushing over to me, and starts hugging and kissing me, and -- and all of a sudden the street fills up with, I don't know, hundreds -- hundred -- I don't know, lots of people. They all kissing me and hugging me and my God, then where is my mom and my dad, and where are the Schtolzenbergs(ph), which is another Jewish family lived in that building, and they knew they were -- they left for the United States much before us. And -- oh, and Walter is here. That's a guy I used to play with when I was very young, his grandmother lived in that same building, he used to come and visit. He had just come out of a prison camp. American stalag.</p><p>And -- and so he came down, and I didn't know what to say to him, and vice versa. I gave away everything I had, like rations and -- K-rations, or whatever I had, and said, I'll be back. I never went back. I went back many years later, s -- not -- maybe 10 years later, and my mother sent me a bunch of money, I should give -- she gave me a bunch of names, and I should give out money to some neighbors that were very supportive of us. Which I didn't know. And I found them, and I start -- I gave them like hundred dollar bills. They really were very sup -- most appreciative with us. So I--</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So this -- this welcome, if -- if I understand correctly, this shocked you? Or you weren't quite sure how to react?</p></p></dialogue>

It's kind of a love-hate, or hate-love, or whatever. I don't know, maybe that's the wrong term, but it was things that, you know, where were you?</p><p>Where were they when we needed them? But they couldn't help themselves. So, they always wanted to know how are my dad, and how is my mom, and what's going on, and so -- how did I come, and I'm an American soldier. And they treated me like I was, you know, the Prince of Wales, or President Roosevelt, or whoever.</p><p>It was -- and then I said, I'll be back, I'll be -- but I never gone. And I went, did some foolish things. I remember that I used to hang out in a place called the Augarten -- Ausarten(ph) -- Augarten, which was next to my gymnasium, and where kids would hang out. And then when the Nazis took over, they put the graffiti on every bench, no Jews allowed, you know, Juden verboten. Couldn't sit ona park bench. So I went back there, I think I sat on 20 different benches.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: It was -- I was waiting in Marseilles, and just actually waiting for -- I don't know for how long, because there was so many people going home, and so few ships. So we had what's called a s -- they had cigarette camps. They were -- camps were called Pall Mall, Chesterfield, Lucky Strike, all after cigarettes. And they were big camps, were all staging areas, you know. We had several million G.Ls in Europe, they had all -- they had -- all had to come home. And one day a few guys came in, and they said they want to go to Marseilles, and I said I have no interest.</p><p>And they said well, we want to check out a weapons" carrier, and a Jeep, then we can't check it out with you. Without me. So I succumbed to the things, and I didn't realize that the jees -- well, I knew that the -- three of those guys were made -- had to --made the invasion of Marseilles with the 42"4 division, and they knew the town.</p><p>And I said, P'll go to go in, but what are you guys -- I'm going to go and find -- if I find some museum, or find a synagogue or something that I -- I was always interested in art, and see what the town looked like, and always remember Charles Boyer, about France and Marseilles, and anyways, he was a big movie star at one  <span class="page-break" number="144"></span>  149 Interview with Fred Lorber December 8, 2011 time, and so -- French -- so I went, and the first thing, that was in the morning, early, they want to go to the house of prostitution. Well, not me. I said, I'm not going, I'll drop you guys off, and Ill pick you up in an hour, an hour and a half, whatever. So, this is nine o'clock in the morning, and they're knocking on our door, and it's -- that time, prostitution was legalized in France until we came, the Americans, and made it illegal. But -- so this place was one of the legalized places, and they had signs outside, off-limits, and out of bounds for the British, that's what they said.

Why? We need 10 people like a million. But 1-- what do you need 10 people? Well, they got a show. And we -- they don't want to put it on unless they have 10 and you're the number 10. So I go in and they put on a porno sh -- girls -- they wake up the girls and they -- they all lived there. It was like Marlene Dietrich was in that place, you know, the -- the lampshades had little strings around them, and -- and they had an old Victrola that you had to wind up, and they had these couches. And I had a sat -- I had not sat on a couch for two years.</p><p>So I sat there, you know, the girls come over and they try to entice you, and so it was all a si-- to make a long story short, I decided I behaved myself for two years, I'm not gonna go get a venereal disease or get [indecipherable] and how will I explain it to my -- which I hope will be my fiancee, and tell the story? Finally, they start drinking, they were selling cognac, and -- and I'm ready to go and one of -- one of the guys gets drunk.

Didn't take very long, and we're carrying out this one guy who had -- so drunk he couldn't walk. And we went back to camp, okay? End  <span class="page-break" number="146"></span>  151</p><p> Interview with Fred Lorber</p><p> December 8, 2011</p><p> of story. Not the real end of story. Twenty-five or 30 years later, I'm in -- in --I live in Des Moines, and maybe was longer than that, and this is a group that I have never known -- never heard of Des Moines when I was in Marseilles, I never heard of Iowa. I lived in New York City, right? And you know, I came to New York, I lived in New York, I went to school in New York, I had hoped to stay in New York, and never heard of Iowa. So I'm in -- back in -- maybe 34 years -- 30 years later, maybe more. And I'm in charge -- I think I was president of the federation, or something, or -- anyways, I'm in charge of the Holocaust Memorial Service.

But he was so impacted by what he saw of Dachau that he spends all his time making speeches about it. It is just -- it's his most important thing of his life right now. He lives in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and he gave me his name. And he says, if you ever have something, you know, about the Holocaust, in the memorial, or you do it once a year, remembrance day, call him up and get him to speak.

It somehow reproduced memories, and I knew how -- how bad the Nazis were. I tried to find some Jewish people when I was in Vienna.

I did meet one -- I was back there a few years later. I was skiing in -- in Innsbruck, in the mountains, and I -- then somehow, I don't know why, we did go to Vienna for a few days, couple of days, I think, and I ran into a Jewish ski instructor, young man. And he told me at that time that there wasn't hardly any Jews, he stay -- he was hidden during the war, or not hidden [indecipherable] didn't know -- people didn't know he was Jewish. And there hardly -- I don't think there were any hard -- hardly any Jews left, out of the 245,000. So we got out just in time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Actually, when -- when do you recall hearing about this first?) When do you recall realizing the enormity of what had happened to the community?</p></p></dialogue>

It had to be -- I lived with it, because of my relatives. But we never knew -- never knew the en -- well, we knew the enormity because the people all disappeared. I had a grandfather that disap -- that I don't -- never met, I never saw, or a couple of uncles. And I found my mother's sister, who per -- was supposed to -- said she was the housekeeper, but I think she may have been the mistress of the -- one of the -- the Supreme Court Justices at -- in -- in Belgium, who left her this palatial home, right smack on the -- what was it, Rue de Justice in Brussels. And I met my other, and I found my other co -- I found a cousin who lived through it. I ran into my first girlfriend, I -- I mean, I never ran into her, I found her in -- in Canada, and she told me how she was s-smuggled over the mountains, the Alps, into Italy.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But -- but I'm guessing these people surfaced a little bit later, so this is --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes, all later, yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- we're talking about "46 - deg47, possibly even to the 50s.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So -- so when -- so in -- in "45, when you're -- you're still in-- in Vienna, how much of this is really sinking in?</p></p></dialogue>

I couldn't wait to get out. I just hated every moment I lived there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But you hated every moment because -- because of what you had gone through?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The history, and what I heard, and what was going on, there were no Jews left, and I could not inter -- I could not interact very much with the Viennese.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm. Did they try to interact with you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I found it very -- I found it very difficult, yes, emotionally.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did they try to interact with you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, well, I had a powerful posi -- not powerful, I had a -- an important position, and I was in charge of the -- the post office, and the PX. Officer came to me one day and he said, you know, you do -- you do -- you -- you the only guy here that -- that people could send money through. Which is true, was true. And there was a lot of black market going on, big time. You buy s -- carton of cigarettes for 50 cents, and you sold it for t-- for a hundred dollars, or 200 dollars, in all occupation money. I just give you an idea of that. So all of this was such an unnatural situation; things that I didn't want to be involved with. And -- and I had these responsibilities, and I wanted out, and I want to go home, I had a girlfriend. I just couldn't wait to go back to the States. And I saw -- I saw Vienna naked.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What does that mean?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What -- what was it like?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Anti-Semitic, hated Jews. They worst -- I think they were worse than the Germans. I have a good friend, he always jokes to me about it, he says Vienna is a beautiful city, there's only one thing wrong. What's that? Vien -- the Viennese. And to this very dear -- very day I think there is -- anti-Semitism is still very strong in Austria.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you -- were you seeing any instances of this in -- in the immediate post- war?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. I didn't see it, but I felt it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Why? What -- what -- what kind of --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I--IThad been -- I had been in Vienna a few times and I'd taken two by -- I had ridden my bikes twice, from Germany into Vienna on a bike path along the Danube. And I've taken a group of people from Des Moines twice. And somehow -- it's maybe me, it may not be them, that I have this oversensitivity, the amount of -- of vulnerability, and I don't feel -- I just don't -- I feel so -- I, you know, I live ina community of 450,000 - 500,000 people, and about 1200 Jewish families here. I feel comfortable, I feel secure. I feel part of the community, and it's -- and when I go to Vienna, I feel the opposite. There is that vulnerability that they somehow  <span class="page-break" number="155"></span> Interview with Fred Lorber 6deg December 8, 2011</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> were able to trans -- trans -- transfer to them s -- to me, yeah. I -- I was -- in one of my ski trips, I left my group, and -- and I was going to go to Dachau. And I went to Munich, and I never been in Dachau. That's where my father was incarcerated.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Of course.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And as I was walking in -- in one of the streets in Munich, and I was going to take this -- there's a suburban train that goes to Dachau from Munich. I went, I bought a ticket in the -- the automatic kiosk, and I couldn't get on the train. I just couldn't make it, I just couldn't get on. And I went out to get lunch, and I saw these people with the tyr -- Tyrolean, or alpine outfits, and laughing, and sitting by themselves. I felt so terribly vulnerable and insecure and said, what in the world am I doing here. And that's the kind of feeling that I've never been able to lose when I --and I've been in Vienna, I don't know, four, five, six times. And I go there, it's like some people go to -- you know, they go to [indecipherable] they kind of have a holiday where they -- they whip each other, they whip themselves. And I go [indecipherable] get my whipping. It's -- I have no any more, any traditional feelings about it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And why do you go back though?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It's a good question. I don't have any desire to go back there now.</p></p></dialogue>

I belong to a hundred year old discussion club, and -- and once every si -- there's -- there are 47 -- 42 members, and once a month somebody presents a paper. And it can't have anything to do with your profession, or the [indecipherable] gotta hide the content of the paper, because after discussion, you know, they don't want to shoot you down. And it's -- it's a kind ofa hard club to get into. So, my paper last -- my turn came up, and I decided to do a paper on --I have an 11" -- this 11 minute film about Hitler coming to Vienna. I got it from the Holocaust Museum. I think I'm their best customer for --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And we appreciate it.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, well, I don't pay to see, they sent it to me.</p></p></dialogue>

And the town in this movie -- it's done, the movie is silent. It was done by an American professor who were visiting there, who had a little Kodak camera. And he was just -- he had this unbelievable ability to be at the right time, to take pictures of Hitler coming to Vienna, and the -- the beez -- and the enthusiasm with which the Viennese greeted the Nazis. And also there's a little episodes in there about his wife trying to go into a Jewish shop, and the SA guy wouldn't let her in, you know, because he said, this is a Jewish merchant, you shouldn't buy here. It's an 11 minute film. Let me tell you what -- I have, someplace here in my office -- I'll -- before I-- we hang up, I'll -- I'll give you -- oh, here it is.</p><p>So you may want to take a look at it, all right?</p></p></dialogue>
