<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Will you just begin by telling me your name during the war and date of birth and where you were born?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Okay, well my name during the war was -- I had several names, but the name I was born to was Annaliza and I was born in Antwerp Belgium in December 1936.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you were very young at the time before the war. You probably don't have too much memory about what was happening prior to the war?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, only very sporadic memories of my father and memories that perhaps are based on stories more than memories but I do think I have very clear pictures of going to the park with my dad and playing with him and doing things that normally you would expect a boy to do with a father rather than a little girl and I thought that people usually ask me why I chose a profession that I chose and although my father was a very orthodox Jewish man and certainly would have never admitted to that feeling I think that I was his first born and I think he considered me in some ways his son. I remember the feeling of going to the park and playing with him and him being perhaps more involved with a child, particularly a man of his generation than you'd expect him to be particularly with a girl.</p><p>That's what I remember.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You had a comfortable family life?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. I remember having two dear little friends who lived with us in the same house, and my grandfather and just pictures mostly not -- I remember I had a little friend who's exactly my age a few months older and his sister who was two years younger and we lived in the same house and we were constantly fighting cats and dogs. We couldn't be without one another. So, we almost really always be together and I also remember that I didn't like dolls and I used to get dolls and I used to give them to my little girlfriend. She loved the dolls. That's what I remember. I remember being very comfortable. I'm sure we were not comfortable I mean financially but I had a very nice feeling about the family. I mean just my grandfather was a very sweet old man. He used to tell me stories.</p><p>That's basically all I remember.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now what kind of business was your father in?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I'm not sure. I think he started out delivering milk and learning how to be a diamond cutter or something of the sort. He was very, very religious. I remember that. He was always going to synagogue, coming from synagogue and praying an awful lot. In my head it seemed like too much. It seemed like not a very tense life. He was going to work and coming home and we observed the Sabbath. We would always go for walks in the park and things of that sort.</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you have non-Jewish friends as well, or were you mostly in a Jewish community?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was strictly Jewish community before the war and to my knowledge, I don't think my parents knew anyone that wasn't Jewish except in an official capacity. I don't know, postman, policeman, -- no social interaction with non-Jews at all.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Your neighbors were Jewish as well?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. The ones I knew. I mean I was a kid so I don't remember everybody who lived there but I would say the majority were Jewish.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, your mother spoke of a lot anti-semitism in Belgium before the war. Do you have any images of that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The only one is a story that my mom told me and that sort of became an indication of my early rebellion and that was at some point during these --right either at the beginning of the war or the pre-war period my grandfather was beaten up on the way back from synagogue or threatened or harassed and he I think people were pulling at his beard and he hid his beard in his coat. When he came home, he looked really terrible and very upset and he had told me that this was a Friday night that Friday night when men used to go to the synagogue they had a couple of angels who were watching over them and walking with them to and from synagogue. So, when he came back beaten and so on, I asked him Grandfather where were your angels then. So, that picture remained with me, his frightened look and the statement that I made then, I don't remember having made it, but it fits with the way I think. So, and several people that I have met, in fact recently, very recently just about three months ago when I was last in Belgium said you are this little girl who said that. They remember that statement. That's the only evidence I have of anti-semitism that touched us directly but before I really don't know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember what your grandfather's response was to that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't think he said anything. He didn't say anything.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you ever have to wear the Star of David?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, I did. Both my mother and I wore it I think after the men, -- the husband of this neighbor and my dad were taken I think to go to a work camp, and we had to wear the star. One picture I have of that is that she used to always carry me over her should to hide her star so that we would travel in the trolley or something and she would carry me so that her star and mine were essentially hidden to avoid being harassed in the streets.</p><p>She'd always do that, carry me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember, and I assume we'll be getting into things that I think you probably have a very clear memory of -- do you remember when Belgium was occupied by Germany? Do you remember seeing troops or hearing noise?</p></p></dialogue>

I remember that, so I remember the German voices and the dogs, particularly the dogs and until maybe ten years ago I had to run if I saw any dog or heard a dog. So, I've overcome that too, but I really was very shaken by a dog. I couldn't go in a room -- and particularly a German shepherd, I would just freeze. I would completely decompensate so I remember that. I don't remember the streets of Belgium per se. I remember the terror of what appeared -- I saw my mother being frightened and I became completely petrified. I remember that march through the woods and ending up in some abandoned home somewhere and being there with a lot, a lot of people. I don't remember who these people were except for those friends that we were living with basically.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you were running to hide from the Germans?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, we were running to try and escape because at some point after the two husbands had gone to work, during that period some people came into the house and they weren't really Nazis, but they pretended to be Gestapo and they beat up everyone in the house. My mother and my grandfather and me and they were really beating us and I remember screaming and my mother screaming. They finally left. They ransacked the place and they were looking for money and so on. They got in on the pretense of being Gestapo and --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: These were just Belgium police?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes, they were just Belgium police or Belgium hoodlums, not necessarily in any kind of official capacity. They might have just done that. This was a good time to do that. I mean it was perfectly acceptable. So, at that time my mother I think and her friend decided to leave and try to join the husbands and I think that this is when we went to France with the idea of trying to get to Switzerland because Switzerland was a safe place.</p><p>If I remember when we got to the rondeveax essentially of where we were supposed to meet our fathers and someone to take us across the border, someone had betrayed and so that's when my parents went to the camps, the French camps , was <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think the first time we left, because we left twice. The first time we might have gone all of us together to in France, and that must have been "40, "41 somewhere around there. And then we came back to Belgium. I think subsequently the men went to work again to that place in France.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Which was called?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: or something like that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: This was near I think?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, in the north of France somewhere. And during the period that they were away that's when we had the incident of people breaking into our home and then we left I think that's when we went through the woods and were supposed to meet up with the fathers and then supposed to meet up with someone who was going to take us across the border to Switzerland, but we didn't make it. So, and we got caught that time. The first time we were simply sent back home. The second time we got caught by the French police who then put us into these sort of transient camps which are really deportation but I certainly didn't know. I don't know how much my parents knew of what these places were going to lead to. I'm not sure they really knew. At some point they heard that people who left there never got back. I mean that through the grapevine that sort of information started to filter through and so they found that out and that's when I was in the children's home they were at a camp and that's when they decided to run out of the camp before they were sent to Germany.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, as I understand it, the second camp they went to was 2 <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was a catholic run home but it ha connection to Jewish organization who was able to channel some of their kids into that particular home.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now you were about how old then?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: At that time I must have been about seven, six or seven because I was born in "36 and that must have been "42, "43 somewhere around there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How long were you in this home?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In this home I was approximately eight to nine months and that part I remember quite well.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell me about it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, things that stand out hunger, real, real hunger. Nothing to eat, but that didn't bother me because I really didn't like to eat but I remember my little girlfriend, food was her thing. She was this plump little thing and you could always shut her up by giving her food. So, I used to run to the kitchen at night and steal whatever I could find and feed her because she was crying all night. She was crying because she was hungry, and I was crying because I wanted my mother. So, we were quite a pair. So, hunger -- and I knew there was nothing to eat and whatever there was I couldn't swallow. I just couldn't swallow any food there. The other thing I remember is lice and the worst incident which may look ridiculous now but was when you had lice they shaved your head, and I was very proud of my hair. I had really beautiful long hair and when I found out that I had lice and I could tell, because I was really itching. I hid in the outhouse. There was no indoor plumbing. There was indoor cold water to wash but no toilet. I hid in the outhouse for a couple of days and nobody could get me out of there because I knew as soon as they found out they would shave my head. So, but they eventually did. I had to get out. They shaved my head, and it was absolutely horrible, just horrible. Now, it looks kind of silly but and it wasn't just lice it was scabies, you know the things that crawl under your skin, so we were not really in very good shape. And there was always a feeling of fear and just terrible -- feeling terrible. First of all, not understanding at all why you were there what was happening, missing your family and just the terror basically. I think I acted irrationally on many occasions where I would just run out of the window in the middle of the night in the nightgown and just try to run away and being caught. You know, brought back to this, so we had songs but I don't know if they made them up or the older children probably did which referred to us having to wake up at 7:00 in the morning and having to wash with cold water and the son reflected that there was no food only some kind of vegetable, something like a sweet potatoes. That's why when people serve me sweet potato at Thanksgiving I say thanks but no thanks. I can't even look at the stuff. I don't know if it's the same, but it's so similar that it's enough to turn me off. That's all we had.</p><p>SO, there was a song that reflected the realities of the time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was a normal day like in this home? What did you do?</p></p></dialogue>

I mean I'm not a psychologist but if I look at myself back then I must have been -- I would qualify myself as a really depressed child, entirely depressed.</p><p>I couldn't do much of anything. We were very regimented so we had to get up at 7:00 and we lined up. I don't know if you saw the several films about children's homes, catholic homes I think is one of them where children just line up <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You said you were there about eight or nine months, how did you get out of there? What were the circumstances?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, the circumstances are a little bit muddled but apparently my parents send someone to pick us up from there because they were escaping to Nice to the part of France that was occupied by the Italians as to the Germans.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: How did your parents get out of 2 <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I don't understand Nice was under Italian occupation, Italian German occupation?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right. But Italian, not German. The Germans came in later, so it really was strictly Italian.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you have total freedom as Jews at this time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Officially no because the official party line of the Italian Nazi government with Mussolini was also that Jews had to be deported and rounded up, but the orders were not quite as effective and there was very little discipline in the Italian army, and those people who were in the army just couldn't care less whether we were Jews or something else.</p><p>They simply couldn't care less so we were supposed to officially hide that we were Jews, but they knew fully well we were and I think we were fairly free to go and do as we pleased. I'm not sure, I think that the order of deportation sort of depended on your nationality and so my parents at the time might have become Czechoslovakian or something like that and giving me a different name and that name I don't remember. If you had Czechoslovakian papers it really didn't matter at the time whether you were Jewish or not. For a short period of time the authorities respected the nationality versus your ethnic background. That didn't last, but for a short period of time it was that way and the soldiers who were supposed to execute the orders couldn't care less. I mean they just did not round up people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, you were in Nice leading what you felt was a pretty nice life in the daytime anyway?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember about how long you were there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I would say also about ten months or so approximately and then when Italy capitulated and the Germans came marching in through the part of France that had previously been occupied by the Italians.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When was this?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The end of --must have been the beginning of "44 or somewhere around there, I think.</p><p>The war was over in "45 and we were in for perhaps a year, so I'd say'44 <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> transportation but try to arrange some kind of private way to join us. From there we were going to try and get through to Switzerland together. So, the train trip was uneventful, I mean my mother and myself and her friend and her two little children went along and we got to a place where I don't know if we stayed in a hotel or I don't know where we stayed exactly. In the meantime my father and his friend was going to come by ambulance.</p><p>They had found someone who was going to drive an ambulance and take them as being ill. So, they established a point of meeting which was a block from the hotel where we had stayed. My father for some really stupid reason decided to go back to his hotel room because he had forgotten his prayer shawl and his , and when he got to the hotel the Germans were there. So, he didn't make it. They arrested him. Apparently Mr. waited until the evening and then the ambulance driver says I'm not going to stay any longer because we're going to get picked up. So, they left and they came and dropped off Mr. Shimmer wherever we were. And then I remember this most horrendous scene of my mother collapsing when she saw him come in alone. She immediately knew that something was very, very wrong. I just remember her just totally going completely hysterical and screaming and pulling out her hair and to me this was just the most frightening because I just came out from something that was relatively safe, and it just was everything fell apart. We stayed together for a while with those people and the family had their parents at least. The woman had her parents in Switzerland and so they decided to really push on and try to get to Switzerland and my mother at that point said she didn't care anymore. She just didn't care, and she decided to stay put in</p><p> , which was the town where we were at. At that point we got papers</p><p> from people who proceeded us and who we paid a lot of money to get those fake papers.</p><p>So, we changed our name again.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: To a French name?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: A French name so my name was .

It was a time for me where I was pretty much like a street child. I did whatever I wanted. I was supposed to go to school but I never did. I mean I said I was going but I played hookey and I was hanging out with sort of the worst characters of the town, but compared to what worst characters are now, I guess they were pretty mild. But we just would go and hide and play. We'd play three musketeers and we'd play all these fighting games. I didn't go to school, I just never showed up, and when I was there I was so disruptive that they used to throw me out, so it really didn't matter. But I learned how to read by myself. Two things I was doing. I was reading voraciously. I didn't understand a thing of what I was reading. I just simply didn't understand. I was just reading books and books. Whatever it was, it didn't matter what it was. It could have been the phone book. It didn't matter. It was an escape, you know, and I could just not be in the present. It was away from everything. I had another friend then who lived nearby. I was friends with all the village kids, basically. Then, the people who were renting us the place were very, very nice. They were French, but they pretended not to know, but they knew of course that we were Jewish. They never questioned anything, but they knew and I used to go to church with them on Sundays because it was kind of accepted and would be better that I would show up. And my mother's French was not great. It still has a very foreign accent, whereas I as a child had really become completely fluent from that time in Nice and in that home I was perfectly fluent so I could pass for French kid easily. They thought it would be a good idea for me to go to church, so at least the child goes even if the mother doesn't show up. I was quite taken by that service. As much as I had been anti-religious to my own religion, there was something very comforting about the church and the priests and there was a very safe feeling in that big building and the way the voices resounded. That I remember that feeling for the church. Now, I hate the catholic church, but I really felt very comforted by that whole atmosphere. The daughter of the people who were renting the place to us had her solemn communion as they call it, and I was very envious. They wore this white dress and this white veil and to me this was like I don't know, utopia, to be able to do all these things.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you think unconsciously anyway that you knew these people were not being annihilated the way Jews were.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, I knew that going to church was a safe thing that once you belonged to that group you were okay. So, I guess it was wanting to be safe and wanting to be part of another group. I mean I knew that I couldn't tell who I was. And, as I said, I was really very angry and I was very nasty. One of the people that my mother had taken in in the meantime until they got someone to take them to Switzerland was extremely fearful for good reasons and was not leaving the apartment at all. I mean it was just really sequestered and would not go out. My mother was circulating freely with her fake papers. I mean if they would really look into it they would have found that her French was not great and she would have been picked up, but she braved it so to speak. I certainly could pass for a French kid, but this man and his wife were there and they were absolutely petrified. He, in particular was just I mean, he wouldn't leave and we had curfews where we had all the windows and so on, and I used to come home supposedly from school, but from wherever I was hanging out and I would scream at the top of my</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

I had this little thing, and if he didn't I was going to give him away to the Germans. You could see the warped feelings that in some way I could pass for not being Jewish. I convinced myself that I was catholic and I was going to be find. I also knew this wasn't true, but somehow I took it out on this poor guy who was really terribly frightened. I mean I can still see myself standing at the foot of those stairs and screaming, you come there and pick up my bag and if you don't I'm going to tell on you. He would come, you know, he would just come. He didn't know what to say.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You were trying to exercise some sort of control?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, like I could go out and he couldn't. But deep inside I knew this was just really not true, but somehow we managed to fake him out a little longer and he didn't have papers and he did nothing and he didn't know French, and he looked real Jewish. He would have been picked up very quickly. In incidents like that where I was just doing really nasty, very nasty things. They were really a way of saying, you know, I can do what I want basically. I'm not going to school. I can just do whatever. Nobody can tell me what to do. There were some terrible moments for me because my mother was frequently gone, and I never knew if she was going to come back, and there were nights where there were alarms for bomb raids, and those were really horrible. They were just just horrible. I would be totally, totally petrified and I had to run to the shelter by myself. I was afraid to get out of bed let alone -- it was all in the dark-- let alone go down the stairs and go to the shelter by myself. I usually managed to somehow make it to the people below and we'd go together. So, when she wasn't home, but then to go back to my place. I mean she didn't want to always say that she was leaving, you know, to the other people. You don't know. They could put a trace on her. She was going to Switzerland. She was getting watches and she was then going to Paris and she was selling them. She was doing all sorts of weird things just to get some money to survive, and she was helping people get across the border, so she really never wanted to say what she was doing and she didn't tell me either. She would just tell me I'll be back as soon as I can, but to an eight year old, that's not that reassuring particularly having been separation where I didn't know if I ever was going to see her again having seen her reaction to my father's disappearance and knowing that that certainly was not really good. I was really scared, I mean really, really scared.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was the bomb shelter in your building or in the town?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was not in the building, it was somewhere further away. I don't exactly know where it was, but we had to go walk in the dark, run basically and to this day I must say that I'm still afraid of the dark. If I'm in the house alone, I'll have every light on. I just won't be -- I really have to talk to myself to be able to turn off all the lights and say nothing will happen. We were in the dark because of curfew to begin with and then you weren't going to start taking flashlights going to a shelter. That was really better.</p></p></dialogue>

They looked awfully Jewish, because she had a wig, but he was a lawyer and he was a very distinguished gentleman, German origin, and perhaps he thought that was going to save them.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I'm sure I helped just with housekeeping things. I'm sure I did some of the shopping where she'd send me to buy food. I remember going to the grocery store and doing all of that stuff. In a more concrete way in terms of I mean I remember seeing all these people, being upset because sometimes we had ten twelve people sleeping in one room. We had five or six people in one bed, so I was not thrilled and I did sort of threaten some of these people, but for the most part I was probably helping her as much as I could. I know that as I said I'm sure I did the shopping and I brought food home and I helped her with cleaning up and that sort of thing. I didn't go to Paris with her to sell watches.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It's interesting that your mother, as you described it, really fell apart when she didn't see your father, and yet it sounds like she was pretty courageous.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: She was extremely courageous but she was courageous throughout but that first impact, that first shock and this is what I remember. Now, I think there's nothing worse for a child than to see the mother fall apart. As long as the mother is still in tact then they know they have somebody to lean on. I realize at that moment that something terrible had happened to my father but I didn't realize exactly what but when I saw her, it just hit me like a sledge hammer. She was really gone. I mean she was just not -- I don't know that it lasted a few hours and maybe the next day she sort of composed herself and she certainly picked up the pieces and went on and survived, and not only survived but helped me survive. There is no question about it, I would not survive without her.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When you think back on the kind of person your mother is, do you think it was predictable that she would get so involved in illicit activities like this?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, not at all. But one thing about her is that even though she came from this small village from this very orthodox background, she was quite somewhat of a maverick within her generation. She was orphaned very early, I don't know if she told you that, but she was about six years old when her mother passed away, mother and one brother went with the Russian flu, so she was very young at the time. She became really the housekeeper for her father for a short period of time, his mother came and took care of the household, and then she got killed in some stupid accident. She got kicked in the belly by a horse. She went to market, so she lost her grandmother maybe a year after that. So, she really became the woman of the house at age eight or nine or something, so she was quite independent. She had to be. She's a really intelligent person and she was</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

So let's say that it's not totally out of character to do things which one would not have expected of a woman of that generation and that background. She adapted. She learned Hebrew, she learned French. She even learned English at that point on her own.</p><p>She didn't have any formal schooling, and she's really a very educated person and it's all self made. I think that she had no inclinations to be a delinquent let's say but certainly to take charge of herself when needed, and so she did. This was the only thing that was opened to her, so she did that. I mean the smuggling of the watches with the resistance that was really self preservation. I think to some extent she I don't know that she really cared that much about herself at that point. I think she just forgot about herself. She just did things for the wider picture if you wish, but she was no longer afraid for herself. She sort of thought well, you know the worst has happened as far as her husband is concerned. She had to leave her father behind in Belgium. She couldn't take him because he wouldn't come. He had to cut his beard off and he wouldn't do that so he stayed behind. She already had lost her mother and a brother so somehow she felt it doesn't matter anymore. There was her child, and so I think she did a lot for me, for my sake.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Even though the people like your landlord who probably looked the other way and knew you were Jewish and was very kind, he must have had some concerns about all the people coming in and out of your attic apartment.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He might have, but I wasn't aware of any frictions. That she could tell you much better.</p><p>I was very welcome in their household. These people were -- he had been a fighter in World War I and he had actually lost a leg or suffered a severe injury so he was limping or had a wooden leg. I just remember him limping rather heavily, and she was just a very sweet lady and they could not have children. In fact their daughter was a adopted one.</p><p>She was one of 14. The woman's sister had 14 children so she adopted her youngest.</p><p>Then I was sort of a welcome addition in a sense because she had hoped to have a large household with a lot of children, and she didn't. I felt so good in that household. It was very warm and just normal. Basically it was just normal. So, that I really always felt very good there, and my mother still writes to them every Christmas. Every Christmas she sends them a box of chocolates. The older couple is now gone, but the one girl, the one whose communion I envied so much is now a grandmother. She's in her 60s. I don't think there could have been too much antagonism. Like I said, he fought in World War I and he was not very fond of the Germans at all, and he was a really strong French patriot and this invasion did not sit too well with him, and he was sort of in a way sorry that he was too old to fight. So, I think in that sense, he knew we were Jewish, but he wasn't quite too sure and all that activity to him sort of looked like a good thing in the sense of being resisting the occupation. Although he wasn't personally involved in my knowledge, he sort of turned away. They were in their 60s at the time I think. They looked very old to me, but again, now that I'm going to 58, it doesn't look that old.</p></p></dialogue>

I was in the apartment, but in the same house. I had been pretty much alone for a long time, so at that point I wasn't even all that scared because it sounded good. So, as I said my mother came back. I don't know how long she was gone, whether it was a week or a month. I don't know. She said we are going back. She had found my dad and that was that. So, we went back and finding him was the real disappointment, because he had changed from the memories. I mean I had this illusion you know as a four year old child your father and the way he was involved with me and he was really -- he was not the same person and by then I was nine years old and I could see things very differently. He came back. I saw him, he had no hair. His teeth were shaking. He looked like a skeleton. He just looked frightening to me, very frightening.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Where had he been?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He had been in Auschwitz mostly. And, he was extremely -- he had become very impatient and irritable and I just wanted to cling to him and it was broken. It just wasn't there anymore. We were just coming from different places all together, and he had become even more religious and rigid about it. I had at that point completely rejected. I mean I just couldn't deal with that at all. I was doing whatever I wanted during the war.</p><p>Certainly not observing the Sabbath, and all of a sudden we're back to not turning on lights, and not going to the movies on Saturday and all that sort of stuff. I just couldn't deal with that at all. I mean I just couldn't deal with that. So, we had lots of fights, really a big arguments and right after we came back we lived in a place that belonged to one of the people that we had met in , a Jewish lady whose husband did not come <span class="page-break" number="13"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 6 sure I'll stay, and as soon as they walked out I was just overcome by such fear that I would just scream by myself in the house and my neighbor upstairs would come and get me. I was trying. I always said, sure you can go. I'm fine. I'm great, no problem. As soon as maybe five minutes after they walked it would just come and engulf me and I couldn't really function very well. Then school was another nightmare because we were people of all ages put into the same class. Now, I was put in the right grade for my age, but I really knew nothing. I just knew how to read because I had read -- and I spoke French beautifully because finally I began to understand what I was reading and I developed a very nice vocabulary. So, on account of that they decided to put me in the proper grade for my age. I knew nothing, so I was in school feeling like I was among -- just what am I doing here. I don't know, but I made it. I don't know how I made it. I just picked up whatever had to picked up and there were people there who were speaking Polish and there were people speaking Yiddish and there were those who were speaking German and I was speaking French. The teachers were themselves, they came from concentration camps or other places. They didn't know anything about anything except they had sticks and when they misbehaved they hit us.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: They just rounded up whom they could find as teachers and there were no one that you could really call a teacher. But I don't know, I just somehow started to click and I became their prize student, so that was another thing that I always had this thing of taking out this anger in some way, so they had these donors, these potential donors and they were trying to raise funds. It was a private school, so they would parade the bright kids around and they didn't have that many. This was like an ape in the circus, do this trick and do this trick. I would recite, they would ask me a question and I would always know the answers. Then, after that, there was nothing in terms of discipline that I would obey.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>We had these individual benches you know, and I would just run across on top of the benches and teachers would run after me with a ruler. I mean some of these teachers are still alive and when they see me they say all this grey hair is from you. I mean, I was just impossible. When I think about it now, really I under normal circumstances would have gone to a reform school or something. It sort of calmed down and at that point, somewhere around the age of nine or so or ten I said I'm going to do something with me life. I'm not just going to be a housewife and sit here passively and have some guy tell me what to do.</p></p></dialogue>

I said no way, not ever, and I decided to get there I had to get toa better school, and so I was in that school for two years. This time in Belgium it's divided into six and six. Elementary and then high school is six years, and I decided to go to the public high school. The public high school which was at the time considered the top high school because from that one you could go straight to university without having to take</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

So, after two years I applied to that high school which was unfortunately in Flemish and that was a language I didn't know at all. So, the only Flemish I knew was from talking to the cleaning woman who used to come once a week and that was the extent of it. But I made it. I mean I got in somehow. I guess I faked it.</p><p>Whenever I think about it objectively I should have never gotten in there because my knowledge of everything was completely sporadic and having big gaps in various places.</p><p>I never learned how to do multiplication, things like that. Big, big gaps, but I got into high school, because it wasn't automatic. You had to apply to get into that particular school. So, but there was anti-semitism in the high school.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: After the war?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: After the war, quite a bit, and there was only two Jewish girls in that whole school, another one and myself. We really had a tough time. It took us years to be accepted and to make friends only a few friends we made on the whole the atmosphere was not welcoming at all, not at all.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you blamed for the war?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, but for instance my dad was religious at the time there was school on Saturdays, and he didn't allow me to go. It was a horror show. I already had missed so much school throughout my life and of course they put Latin and Greek and math and whatnot on Saturday. This really is not easy, and the teachers refused to help. I mean I would have to go every Saturday night -- I mean that's why I became even less attracted to the religion. I had to go and beg from some girl who really didn't want to give me her notes for all the lectures that had been given that day and then try to work it out on my own because my father didn't know anything and my mother didn't know anything about that stuff. The teachers just said, her statement was, "Well, you Jewish girls don't want to come to school on Saturday, you just work it out. It's not my problem." It makes you feel that after all that hearing this business about Jewish girls -- it was a secular school, it wasn't a school that was under any kind of religious aegis or directives. That's what the public school was. It was a secular school where there was religion given according to what you wanted so there was one hour you could choose either religion or ethics so you didn't have to attend -- because there was a catholic school system just as there is one here an official catholic school system. So, the people who were there, weren't even observant, but they still had a feeling that we were foreigners. Essentially the feeling was that we were foreigners. We were different and foreign. We did not feel very well there, really not, and then later they opened a Jewish high school and most Jewish kids now go to the Jewish high school, which is now fully accepted.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, oh yes.

We were, as I said, in fifth grade, everybody was together, all ages, all languages. This high school developed just a few years after I started high school.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What happened to your grandfather?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My grandfather I think was essentially beaten to death. My mother's father, the one who's picture is there. He refused his son, my mother's brother, left I believe it was the last boat that left Antwerp and they went to Brazil and then somehow got to the states, and he didn't want to go because you had to cut your beard to get on that boat. I think when we fled, he refused to come for the same reason and so apparently my mother had asked a neighbor, a non Jewish neighbor to take care of him and she said she would but she heard when she came back to Belgium that he had essentially been beaten to death on the streets.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: In terms of who I am today, I would have liked all this activity around survivors of the war whatever events took part in their own lives to happen earlier because even as I tell these things and some of these things bring tears to my eyes so that i know that I still feel them, but they're not -- I think I'm now perhaps able and it hasn't been that long -- able to associate my reactions to trauma and whatever from the past. So, it's hard for me to say now. The worst part of it was the fear, you know the absolute terror that I can still invoke certain times thinking back particularly --the salient points were in that home where I just didn't know where anybody was. And then when my dad was taken. These were just terrible, terrible moments. I know that until he died, my father -- I had many, many nightmares about anticipating his death that they were just really terrible and I was acting irrationally during many years in relation to him in terms of being so afraid that he would die that I could not even enjoy when I was near him. He wasn't a well man, although he pulled together and rebuilt a life for himself and helped his brothers build their own lives, so he did a tremendous job. I couldn't even appreciate any of this. I was just always afraid of losing him so that was sort of something that marred my life for a long time. In fact, I think I was liberated from that feeling only when he died. When he finally died, I sort of gained some peace which seems sort of crazy, but that's what happened. When he died, I said okay that's over. He's really gone and he's not coming back. That's it.</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

She became religious and I wasn't, but a certain point in time we were going to synagogue for the high holidays and our mothers would try and make us pray and we would just giggle. I mean that's all we'd do, we'd giggle. We could just not do pray or do anything. Then when I went to study, I left home and I went to Switzerland and the very first Rosh Hoshana Eve I went to synagogue. I didn't even go inside. I stayed outside the entire time, but I was there. You know, I just felt that I had to express that I was part of that group but I wasn't going to pray because the prayers meant nothing to me. The prayers are sometimes very pretty if you look at them in terms of poetry, but I really don't believe in God. I really don't believe in that at all. So, my religion would be expressed in terms of how people should relate to one another and nothing to do with some superior being. I'm a scientist and I don't believe in that at all.</p></p></dialogue>

If you do that, you won't be alone.</p><p>If you persist in living in the past and saying that you can't do anything and nothing is going to work out because you went through this terrible thing, then you will remain stagnate and people will shy away from you and you'll just be a very lonely person.
