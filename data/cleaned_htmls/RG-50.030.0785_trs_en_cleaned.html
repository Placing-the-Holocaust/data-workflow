<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, it was already there, because when -- when -- when they -- when he left his village -- when he was born, he moved into this -- it was called a colony really, you know. Like the --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It was a colony.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Colony. Kolonia, in Polish. But it was a straight street, very straight street, and houses on both sides of -- of the street. And there was a church, there was a blacksmith there, who was very busy all the time. I-- I spent some time watching how they were putting shoes on the horses. So, it was interesting to watch.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, for a little kid. <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Anthony Chudzik deg January 24, 2015</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And then there were -- there was -- well, there were -- I -- I-- a carpenter. There was a big place where the owner was the carpenter, he built furniture and all -- all sorts of things. So that -- that it's -- that's about all I can recollect.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Well, that's a lot. That's a lot. Did --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes, and I remember there was a pond at -- at the end of this colony. I spend some times cat-catching the frogs in that pond.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did your family have land near the house? You kept -- you kept farm animals, you kept cows and horses.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And what were they used for? The cows, I can imagine, for milk.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, the horses were used to toi -- to work on the farm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So, in other words, you lived on a farm --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: On -- on a farm -- no, the farm was attached, or the house was built on a farm, because every owner had a lot behind the house, let's say, you know, a lot of area, where they would raise grain, and -- and cabbage and potatoes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You know, one of the reasons I focus on this, is because it's -- it is in some ways unusual for people to -- it doesn't sound like you lived in the middle of an agricultural place, insofar as you had a street, you had both houses on the side of the <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> Interview with Anthony Chudzik deg January 24, 2015</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> street, and -- and it 1 -- sounds almost like a small residential area, but not a place that's a farm area. And -- and --</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, some of those habitants, or the people who lived there, were of German extraction.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, so it -- it -- it was even referred like a German colony.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, because there were Polish people, and some German people were living in there, so the buildings I can recollect, were brick buildings, and pretty substantial, let's say, you know, there's -- they not dilapidated or anything like that, it was -- I think it was a fairly new colony.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Let's turn now a little bit to your family. Did you have brothers and sisters?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, there were four of us, and two sisters.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: M-Most of people probably came from different areas, from around the villages, because I think it was a fairly new settlement, let's say, like outside of this larger village, Wola Zarezycka.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But, I am talking about the early life, because in 1932, my father bought some land in the eastern part of Poland, because there were huge far -- farms, owned by counts -- hrabias, in Polish, and they were dividing the land for purchase, and a lot of people then purchased this -- this land. So we moved from that original area, into the eastern part of Poland.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. I'm going --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And that's where my -- most of my youth -- of course, that wasn't long, because from "32 to 1940, when we were deported to Russia, it's what, only --</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, he -- four hectares is -- it's maybe small for a farm, but it's an awful big area for, you know, a lot of land. You know, for a piece of land.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, I think it was just average.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So people were -- were able to buy -- some people who had some contribution in obtaining the independence of Poland were given land. But my father did not get, he bought it.</p></p></dialogue>

It was still dark outside, maybe five o'clock, something like -- we all asleep. So they started banging on the doors, open up, open up. So, I think -- I don't know who was the first, Father, Mother, got up, went to the door, opened the door, they came in. There were about five Russian soldiers with guns -- no rifles, with rifles and bayonets. And first of all, they said, do you have any weapon? Imet" oruzhiye.</p><p>That's in Russian.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Imet" oruzhiye?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oruzhiye. Do you have weapons? My father says no, I don't have any weapon.</p><p>Although, he did have a rifle hidden somewhere, but that was useless, you know.</p><p>He didn't even say nothing, because he couldn't get to it, or even if he could, he couldn't do anything, because there's lo -- many of them, these Russian soldiers, well-armed. So they say, pack up. Start packing up because we are -- you are going to be taken away from here. And says, you -- you do not belong -- you do not belong to here. He says, Father, what? This is my land. No, it's not yours. We are taking over. It's no more -- no longer it's yours, you -- you have nothing, just pack up whatever you can, food and some clothing. Because they came with those vehicles, carriages. <span class="page-break" number="60"></span> Interview with Anthony Chudzik " January 24, 2015</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Horse-drawn carriages, yeah. And they said, here, pack up what you want, or what you can, take some warm clothing and some food. So -- and they were well, like I say, armed. You had to obey their orders. I mean, Mother was resisting.</p><p>Whatever Father and sisters, maybe even I put on, on this vehicle, she would throw off. She was very unreasonable, you know, wha -- with them. She -- she -- she didn't -- she couldn't comprehend this, you know, what's going on. Why -- why are you taking us away? What was -- where are we going? We don't know, but you have to move. We'll -- we'll take you away from here. So she was throwing things off. And the soldiers would put some food, let's say, food or clothing, or -- back on the vehicle, she would throw it back. They threaten her, if you will continue like this, we'll shoot you. This is what -- what the soldiers said. And my brother-in-law started talking to my mother, and says, you have to do what they tell you to do, because otherwise, you know, it may end tragically. That's what he said. Now, so she calmed down, and we put some stuff on the -- on these carriages, and then they drove us away from our home.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How much -- how much time had they given you to do this?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh, it-- maybe hour and a half, it was something like that. No -- no more than two hours. We -- we -- we were on the way.

So they put all these people together in this school, and I remember that I had a violin at home. So I sneaked out from the school, went back to our house, which wasn't far, maybe half a mile. So when I entered the house, the soldiers were already cooking eggs, you know, and bacon, and everything else, smell nice, you know, they having a good time in our dining room. So, I took the violin. I could have run away somewhere, you know, to</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: --some neighbors or something like that, but I didn't. I took the violin, and I went back to my parents, which were held in that school. But I saw this [indecipherable] when they already having good time on the food and everything.</p><p>So imagine, I -- I see -- really terrible thing to even imagine how these people felt, that they had to leave everything behind, for what, why?

In other words, until you die. But it -- it wasn't -- this word die is not regular death, but if you -- by the time you just end your life. Podokneish(ph), it's more towards the animal, you know, pe --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But over there it was different for animals. The animals, they're just ending their life.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. <span class="page-break" number="92"></span> Interview with Anthony Chudzik 8 January 24, 2015</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So you are here until you end your life. That's all. That -- th-that was -- they will always tell you that you are here to work, until you die. You could hear it from every guard, cause there were armed guards over there. It was like a -- a military compound.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And so was it surrounded by a fence?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, there was no fence. The -- the fence was natural habitat, you know, I'm -- where could you go?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Forest, and nothing. There was a river, a large river. Nobody could pass probably, unless he knew how to swim. But what -- where -- where could you go?</p><p>On the other side of the river?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So-</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I--I did swim that river, and I -- although, I was -- yeah, I was only 13 years old, to begin with, and then 14.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. So -- so, did they tell you what the work was? What was the work that everybody had to do?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The work, mostly men and able women were assigned to cut timber. They were cutting timber, woom, you know, and then cutting these shorter pieces, about a yard long, three feet long. And somebody would put a cubical or something, you know, <span class="page-break" number="93"></span> Interview with Anthony Chudzik " January 24, 2015</p><p> like three by three. And then they would tie it with a rope, and there -- the guy responsible, supervisor -- a ma -- a Russian guy, would come and stamp these pieces. He had like a hammer, and he put a stamp on everyone. It was funny. Well, now it's [indecipherable] but some people were -- would cut the ends very tiny, you know, cut it off during the night, or something like that. And they said, well, this is what we did today. So he would stamp it again, but it was the same cubicle.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, in other words, they cut out the --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They were cheating, people were cheating the authorities, let's say.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So that meant they -- they'd cut the end that he had stamped.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And they cut the stamp off, and they left it as if it hadn't been, and then dwi -- they used the same cubic feet of -- of logs for the next day.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. For the next day. But it wasn't that -- I mean that -- it's not that typical, really.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, not that often.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not that often, but it happened. I know that happened, because my brothers used to do it, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What kind of instruments did they use for cutting logs, for cutting the trees?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, hand saws. <span class="page-break" number="94"></span> Interview with Anthony Chudzik " January 24, 2015</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Hand saws.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Hand saws. A big saw about five feet long, with big teeth, and a handle at each end, and they would --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So all of this was, let's say, from human energy, no machines at all.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: There were machines at a saw mill.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because what happened, they cut the wood, timber, and they put them in the river. And they would float those logs on the river --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: --to a place where they had saw mills.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And there were machinery with hooks, metal hooks, that would constantly rotate like this, you know, big chains, maybe 12, 14 feet long. And they -- this chain would go into the river. And there were men who were guiding the logs towards this machine.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And the hooks came, brought the logs on the shore, and there were people who took the logs again, in human strength, human force, and cut them into shorter <span class="page-break" number="95"></span> Interview with Anthony Chudzik " January 24, 2015</p><p> pieces, and put them into these cubicles, and from then on, they would move them on trains, to paper --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Paper mills.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Factories, or paper plants, or --</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Until I was 14 years old, I was forced to go --I mean forced, I liked to go to school. But it was a very short time, you see, when -- when we arrive there, in February, I went to school.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because there was schools for the Russian people there. So, until I was 14 years old, which, only few months, then I could stop going to school, and go to work.</p><p>And this is what I did, cause I didn't want to go to school there, so I started working when I was 14 years old.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Interesting.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So there were big boilers, constant, and supply tubes. They had systems, you know, built pretty well. Organized, you know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was it -- was it -- were you warm, as you were doing this? Was this a kind of a job that people would have wanted to have, because of the conditions, or is it a difficult job?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. No, no, no, you -- you -- you had no choice, you were -- you were assigned.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: There was no other work available, only timber. Everything was timber.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- regular tracks. Well, we had to push this to where the other people were cutting the -- the wood to shorter pieces. We collect those ends, put them on the thing, and take it to the boiler area.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So was -- so, it was the ends of the wood that was the fuel?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Or whatever was there, because they were cutting certain lands, equal lands, but there were leftovers. So this leftover, we picked up, and haul it -- haul it to -- to the boiler area.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. And so, in your own barracks, did you also have some of the scrap wood to heat your own barracks, or --</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- boss of that area. And then he started getting sick. And on -- on the first, like I mentioned, on the first of January, we le -- we decided to leave. And he was already very sick, very sick. But, we started the journey. And on the 17" day of the journey, he passed away, during the journey. And it was Perm, a place near Ural mountains.</p><p>He -- he died, and I -- I was, up to the last moment with him. We were talking, and he was saying goodbye, and you know, that -- and he just gave up. And we left him on a platform, because when the train sto -- I said, Mother -- it was about one o'clock in the morning, I said, Father just passed away. Well, so the first time -- the first thing, the train stopped at the station, I remember, the Perm station, you know.</p><p>They took his body out, and put it on a railroad platform, you know, like there are tracks on large stations, so there are platforms between the tracks. So there were already about maybe 50 corpses on the platform, so we just took him. My -- Roman, because we traveled together, and myself, and we just left him on the <span class="page-break" number="127"></span>  131 Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 railroad platform, without -- without funeral. We -- we tried to get some kind of arrangement, but it was impossible, you know, there -- it's impossible, just leave here, and a-as I say, there were already large heap of corpses there. So we just put some wrapping around him, left the corpse there. You know, it's -- that was the Perm railroad station, because in Russia, there was just tru -- you know, communication, rails. That -- that was the main -- main system of moving around, either freight train or passenger train, but passenger trains very, very rare.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was -- you said he was saying goodbye to everybody in -- as you were talking to him?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, he was -- we were -- I was talking to him and saying goodbye. But after he gave up, then I-- I woke my mother.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I didn't know when he is going to have the last breath. I didn't know that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But it happened during the night, and I -- I knew when it happens, and then I woke my mother, and -- and I said, the first thing we stopped at the station, they put him on the platform, and -- and he was left there, with others. But the death was the normal way there, you know. Inhuman, terrible to talk about. Nobody can understand that. We were treated -- I can't even say. Worse than animals, by the <span class="page-break" number="128"></span> Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015</p><p> Russians. They didn't care. Because it -- that was Stalin's policy. You are here until you die, but in our case, we were -- I mean, blessed that it -- that we did get out of that hell. It was pure hell. People don't realize like -- you know, no -- no clinic, no doctor, no help. No, it -- they -- they didn't care. We die here or there, today, tomorrow. Nobody cared. Only you family cared, nobody else. The main thing was to get some food. That was the main thing and then I think that was Stalin's policy, you know, starve the people so they cannot do anything else but think about how to survive.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Like you said, everybody left --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I--I don't know, I don't know. I don't know how to continue, because this is -- this is the worst. Worst moment of the life.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you want us to stop for a little bit?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, I don't know. Maybe a little, how about --</p></p></dialogue>

Like dig ditches, or something like that, and th-they were going home, and there was a farmer bringing some potatoes. And some potatoes fell. A raw potato fell on the ground, and this guy grabbed this potato, and started --</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Who -- who would believe something like that, that one man can do to another?</p><p>Why -- why -- why did we have this concentration camp? Why they're so -- you know, mean to each other? Why?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Is that a question that you were asking yourself?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I want answer, why people fall for all, that they forget that they are human being, that they have soul, and responsibility. We -- we are not vegetable. We are people with feelings, with soul. Those who believe, I don't know, some people don't believe that, but I -- I believe. I-- I'm a religious person. So I cannot imagine how <span class="page-break" number="130"></span>  134 Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 another human being could be so mean, you know, to his fellow man. But I--I don't know. I've seen a lot in my life.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you -- did you ever question while -- when you were there, did you ever question your belief? Did you ever think there -- there can be no God, because a -- what I'm seeing is so terrible?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, this -- then the -- no, it did not occur to me like that, but I did question, you know, how can these people be saved, or something like that, you know how -- maybe there isn't. But, if somebody commits such a crime against another human being, he has to pay for it. It would be unfair if these people who were so sav -- savages to another people, went free. I -- I cannot imagine that. So I think that there is -- there must be some justice, oh, some justice that people will pay somehow, one way or the other. But maybe there isn't a way. Well, on the other hand, you know, this is probably not for social discussion.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't expect them to really understand, but I would like them to know how fragile is the human character, or something, that you know, people can change from being very nice, to being really like an animal to one another.
