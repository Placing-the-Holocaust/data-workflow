<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was liberated in a silo after the last march called Chinno, that a lot of ki -- little camps out of Stutthof were concentrated. And the two typhuses broke out. And to tell you the honest truth, I don't remember when I was liberated. I thought they were burning down the silo, so I covered myself with straw, but there were people were left, the dead around me, and I woke up in a German house, with the Russian's doctor taking care of</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

I had the two typhuses. And then they shaved my head again, and they put a salve on it, and I looked like musselwoman. And I could hardly walk, or talk, or recognize anything. And after three days, or a week, I don't know exactly, they told us we have to leave that village, because the front is coming on. So we should walk to Lomborg.</p><p>Lomborg is in Polmarin. And it was not far from Chinno. And as we were walking, I with a little friend of mine holding a hand, we saw two Russian soldiers, and I -- that I will never forget, and a two carriage -- two wheel carriage -- officers, and we asked them to take us to Lomborg, and you know we covered our head with -- with scarves, and we -- they shouldn't notice that we have typhus. And they said, "No, we cannot do it, because we are not allowed to." But they felt so sorry for the two youngsters, that they put us behind, in that little carriage, but they said, "The first house in Lomborg, you have to get out." So, as we came into Lomborg, the first house, they said in -- in Russian, out. So, we went out, and the first house we walked in. And all I can remember is everything was empty, except there was a big, big rug, maybe a Persian rug, I don't know, at that time I didn't know from Persian rug, or China rug, or anything else. And in the middle was standing a bottle, with blueberries. And I didn't know it was preserve, or something.</p><p>There was no water in that house, nothing. And we were still sick, I and that little girl, we had a temperature little bit, and we were -- we were really out. And sh -- she said, "Shall we drink it?" I said, "I am afraid it may be poisoned." Left poison, there's that bottle standing there, there's no water, there's nothing. And then we couldn't stand it any more, and what happened is is we drank, and we ate those blueberries. And at that time I was so</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Later on I realized that we got up the next morning, and we felt so much better, that it was fermemented. It was set up for wine, or something, and it helped the temperature. And our temperature dropped. We s -- we went around, and we looked around like scavengers for food, and we found some food, and then I recognized some people from my hometown, and they was already looking -- you know, after two weeks, three weeks, they're grown up people. And they saw me, it was like a lifesaver for them, because the Russians are going on the front to Lomborg, and they were raping the women. German, Jewish, it didn't matter. They were getting drunk and raping them. So what they did is they -- they dragged me and that little girl into their apartment where they lived, six women. And if you put a sign up that it's typhus, the Russians didn't care, they just tore it down and they came in, and they made hia -- chaos. And what happened is -- is that whenever a Russian came in, they took my scarf off my head, and they gave me a bottle with medicine, and they send me out in the front room, and turn on the light, and the Russians, as drunk as they were, they start running, because they know there was typhus in that -- I was over already, but still looked like a musselwoman, you know, sick with the salve on my head. They start running. And this is how I saved six women from being raped by the Russians. Then my hair start growing in a little bit, and I was going down the stairs, and there was a little pond near that apartment, and there wasn't that much water, and anything, and I thought I'1l wash out my -- whatever I have, in that pond. And all of a sudden I looked up, and there were two big, black boots in front of me, and I looked up, and he said to me, in Russian -- at that time I was still speaking Russian.</p><p>This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

I mean, am -- am I Jewish. And I said yes. He said, "I am too, from Odessa, don't get scared." So I took him up into the apartment where the girls were.</p><p>They saw us [indecipherable] they got so scared, they said, "Are you out of your mind?" You know, they dragged me back in the other room. And it so happened that it -- he was there for two weeks. He fall in love with me, he wanted to marry me. He gave me even a wedding band. And I wasn't even 15 years old yet. But nobody knew that. And he says to me he is going on the front, and he is going to write to his father, and his father will la -- his father is a doctor in the army, a big officer, and arrange to pick me up. And I thought to myself, "Let him talk." But -- but the mo -- wonderful thing was about it, for all two weeks he slept in the front room of our apartment, so nobody could get in. And when he left, we went to work in a hospital, to help the Russian soldiers. So we slept there, so nobody could touch us there either. And one day a man came up to me, and he said, "Akeem Marouskas Supporzhnikova?" Am I Marsha Supporzhniko -- Marouska -- ma -- Marioshka Supporzhnikov. And I said yes. "My son wrote a letter at home that you are here in Lomborg, and I was looking for you, and here I find you in the hospital. I would like to send you to Odessa. He wants to marry you." And I told him, I said, "I cannot do it. I have to go back home first. I have to see where my -- if I have any family left, I have anything," I said. He said, "Do you love my son?" I said, "I don't know him well enough.</p><p>I don't know what love is." I's -- I -- he didn't know my age, he didn't know nothing.</p><p>Nobody know nothing about anybody. And, you know, I was still scared to tell my age, because my two little sisters were killed because they were under 15. And I -- so even</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

So, even to that man that was the fa -- and I asked him, I said -- this may not be interested on the tape, but I asked him, I said, "Tell me, why are you, a officer in a different battalion, from a different town than your son is, and you're not even Jewish?" Everybody says Marshall Zou, or whatever his name was, I don't even remember, and he says, "You see, they took us, the Jewish officers, and doctors, and send us to different places, because when we were caught from the Germans, that the soldiers, the Russian soldiers shouldn't give us out that we are Jews on top of it." So this is my first lesson I learned, that I wasn't the only one that suffered, and there were other people as young as I was, at -- it concentrated, that answer concentrated into my mind. And we felt better, and we didn't know there was [indecipherable] existed. We didn't know about people not going back home or nothing. All I want is to go home, and see what's happened.</p></p></dialogue>

I didn't know if they are - - were dead, or alive, or nothing. I had a feeling that they were killed there. All taken to Theresienstadt. Now that I read the books about it, ther -- and then from there to Auschwitz. I don't know what happened to them. I can only tell you I lost them, about maybe a week after we were in Stutthof. But the only thing that bothered me is that they were taken out of the uniforms, the striped uniforms, and given civilian clothes when they</p></p></dialogue>

And when I wanted to go with them, they left a big dog on me, this is all in my other tape. And all I wanted to go and see if anybody was left. I was -- my father was in Dachau. I know my grandfathers were taken away in the beginning, and -- and this -- I knew they were dead. My other family -- certain family members were all dead, because I know they were taken on the ninefort and killed in Kovno, of the Kovno ghetto. And anybody did nothing -- not many people escaped from the ninefort. But the thing is is, is -- what I want to tell you is that I wanted to go home. So they said yes, they'll s -- they'Il s -- put us on trains, and they'Il send us home. So they put us on big trucks, and they took us to a place, a good -- I don't know how to say it in English, a ranch, a big ranch in -- in Palmerton, it was near Nimitz, near -- not far from Stetlin, not far from Lomborg, Rigenwald, Lomborg, and so on. And they took us there, and there were some Russian girls, white Russian girls, they were playing the piano. And the Jewish girls, the one that went with the Germans -- and the Jewish girls, they put us to clean up stalls, and they put us to -- to -- to -- to -- to the dirtiest work in the world. They didn't give us enough food, the Russians. They didn't kill us, they didn't beat us, but there was a -- they -- we -- we -- we were always watched, we were always watched with guards, like in the [indecipherable]. The only difference was that we weren't beaten up, we weren't treated as dirty Jews, but we were treated different. There were about maybe 10 Jewish girls. And one day the captain asked me if I -- asked anybody if they would like to go to learn with veterinarian. There is a doctor in Rigenwald that will teach veterinarian, because what they were doing is taking the cows and the horses of the fields</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And they opened a conzerr factory, and they open a cheese factory. And what they did is, they needed the cows to be healthy, to see if they're healthy, they take -- to take analysis from horses -- I found that out later, when I came back. I said, "I'm going." Like in German concentration camp, in those little camps, if they needed somebody to go to threshing, f -- harvesting or something, people were sent to s -- Auschwitz. I didn't care any more when they took away my mother, my two little sisters, and the rest of my family. So I was the first one, I -- he sa -- I said, "I am going to Rigenwald." We came to Rigenwald, the doctor that they sent to teach us, it must have been from different camps around that, but from our camp we went only one Russian girl, and two Jewish girls. And what happened is is that -- what's so amazing is that the doctor was a drunk. He was compl -- always drunk. And we learned some. We learned how to protect when a cow is slaughtered, to recognize if it has tuberculosis around the lungs.</p><p>We learned how to take analysis from a horse's neck. We learned ho -- if they got this eye sickness, the horses, to get rid of them. We learned the cows, they had a certain thing on their skin, to put them -- what is the end of a -- of a match called? It's a certain chemical. Put them in a tent, and put them into the chemical. So get away the sickness shouldn't spread. We learned certain things in -- in about three weeks, but the most important thing for me was that I made friends with the put -- Polkolvnik's wife, with the main man's wife. I must have had in me pa-part of it of my father, like I said before. She went in a nightgown to the opera, and [indecipherable] others. I -- I told her that's not proper. I told her your hair doesn't look, let me comb it for you. We got to be the best of This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And they treated me like a daughter the two weeks I was -- three weeks we were there. After three weeks we got a paper with a pitshot, you know, with the stamp, like the Russians always do. Akivia trinarn inyarz. I was a veterinarian nurse, believe it or not. We came into that village again, we worked.</p><p>We worked with the horses, we worked this. Two weeks later, after we came back from Rigenwald, they put -- Polkovnik and his wife arrived in that good -- in that trench. There was a very, very ugly captain that run it, and he hated Jews, very anti-Semitic. And he said, "Akdere Marouska?" Where is marsh -- Marouska. And the captain said, "In her room with the other Jewish girl." He says, "In her room? You mean to tell me she doesn't have an apartment of her own?" And his wife got very mad. He said, "I want to call her immediately for dinner, to have dinner with us." Because there was dinner in the captain's house. It's a bi -- in the good -- you know, in the ranch, the big ranch house. So when he called me in, I had dinner with them, and he gave a order to the captain that I have to have my own apartment, that I have to be in charge of the cheese factory. I have to be sent to a different village. But in a couple of weeks, till they have everything prepared, and -- now, don't forget, in July atel -- I was liberated in March, and July atel 15. And what happened is is before I left for the other -- good for the other ranch, big ranch, the Jewish girls were playing a piano, and the Russian girls were cleaning the stalls. But what they did is, I was there to be heavily guarded, because they would have killed me, the Russian girls. So what happened is is when I went to that good, I arrived, and I was all of a sudden I was in charge of a milk factory -- cheese factory, and at night</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053 10 the Russian soldiers from all around, from the good that I worked in, the ranch, from all the ranches they would come, and -- and Polish soldiers they would come, and I would give them all cheeses and milk, cause the Russian soldiers weren't fed either. They would cut around the tuberculosis, around the cows, and then they would make like a soup with potatoes, and every -- that all they had to eat all day. Everything was shipped to Russia.</p><p>And what happened is is that they liked me very much the Russian soldiers, and the Polish soldiers came, and there came some fliers from Stettlin, and they would bring liquor and so on. But one thing would happen, when they would get too drunk, the woman that owned that ranch was a very, very wealthy woman. That's the first time I ate waffles in my life, because she had the stove that she moved waffles around. She was from Pullman. She was German, from Pullman, and she was like a mother to me. So the minute she saw that they got drunk, she lock me upstairs in one of the quarters, and nobody could get near me. But I did a lot of things in that camp that a child of my age wouldn't do. I was boar hunting, believe it or not. I was boar hunting with the Russians, with the Polish officers. I -- I did everything I wanted. I run that village. And I was ride out, with the guard of course, I would ride out to the fields, and check up on the pomeron women, and see the German women, and see how they milked the cows, if they are clean in the fields and so on.</p></p></dialogue>

But then about a month later, I was taking them medicine, and food, I was stealing from the Russians, and giving to the poor German kids.</p></p></dialogue>

And one day the captain came to me, and that -- this is a really funny story. He came to me to my village.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>And he says, you know there was a befell -- was like when there's a order that the -- the Russians can take nothing away animal from the Germans. Absolutely nothing, no cows, no horses, nothing. And the eye sickness of the horses, I forgot how it was called. I was never a veterinarian, so I forgot it. Broke out and we lost seven horses, and they put -- Polkovnik was coming, and he said, "Your village is full of horses." He's talking to a grown up person, you know. "I need seven horses." I said, "Fine, P'll give you seven horses. You release seven see -- seven girls from the -- that you're holding. If you put them on the train, I'll give you seven." Said, "I can't do that many, but I'll release some." I said, "Okay." So how do I do it? I have to have a plan. So I sat down, and I talked to the German woman that took care of me, and I made myself a plan. I am -- I got a lot of fantastic liquor from those majors that came, from the -- the pilots from Stettlin. And I</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053 12 invited seven officers from the Polish camp. And we got them so drunk that they were flat on the floor. We took off their uniforms, there were waiting seven Russian soldiers.</p><p>We put the Polish uniform on the Russian soldier, and the Russian soldiers, they went out, they got the seven horses, came back, got them dressed back their uniform, dropped them on a cart, and took them back to their camp. The next thing the rumor was in the village that the Polish army stole seven horses. Now I had something over that captain.</p><p>He was so afraid of me that you have no idea. Because God forbid he should go to the higher ups, and everything. So everything I wanted, I got. So when the soldiers from each camp, when I rode with them, wanted to come and eat at my camp, they came and eat. If they wanted to -- whatever they wanted to -- the Jewish girls lived the life of Riley, and he was afraid of me as hell. One day I was riding with a man from Georgia, I'll never forget, and a short Jewish man came up to me, and in Jewish says to me, "Are y -- do you know anybody by the name of Myashka Supporzhnikov?" And I said to him like that. I put my hand to my throat, my mouth, and I said, "Oh please don't say anything." And the Russian soldier understood what he said, or he had a feeling. He said, ""Marouska, don't worry. Anything you want I'll do for you, because you saved my life, you got some medicine when I was sick. You brought food for me. I will help you with anything I can." A very, very lo -- I couldn't say low [indecipherable] because he was intelligent, with intelligent you have to be born. Very average person, you know? And I couldn't understand why he does it. And he said, you know what? So I tell him the story, that I found out from that man that my father is alive in Ledz, in Poland, and he came to pick This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

So he said to me, "Not only will I take you -- let you go, but I'Il take you to the train." And I want to tell you something. When we came into the villages, the houses were empty, but there was so much clothes, and jewelry, and cameras. With everything was in my apartment, when I was riding on that horse, I didn't even have a sweater on.</p><p>I'll never forget, I had the silk, maroon blouse on. I remember now, I didn't remember before, riding boots, and -- and they're real good boots, because one of the officer, police officer, brought it to me, and riding pants. That's all I had with me, because I was going with him to check out the fields, how the milk is going, how everything is going. And I said, "Okay. You are taking me to the train, but I'm going to give you a letter. And when the captain does something to you, you tell him, "I have a letter from Maroushka about the seven horses." " I said, "At least I can do for you that you don't get punished, or put in jail, or anything like that." So what I did is I -- I still wrote Russian at that time, I sat down, and in no time I wrote him a letter. He took us to the train. And that man says to me, "Now remember, I am Polish, I speak very good Polish, your father send me, and I want you to be like you're -- you don't know how to speak, you don't know how to -- you're -- you're dumb. Whatever anybody says, you just move your head." Because at that time, the Polish Akar, the Polish fascists were killing the Jews like crazy, especially on trains, and so on. And I listened to him, and he might -- I don't even [indecipherable] I was freezing a little bit. And I went to -- we went with the train and we arrived in Lodz.</p></p></dialogue>

I was smoking, and he said, "You can't smoke." And I said, "What do you mean to tell me I can't smoke? I can smoke, I can do whatever I want to." If I thought to myself, maybe at that time -- I don't know if I thought to myself this way, if I can handle a Po-Polkovnik [indecipherable] I can handle my father, you know. If he tells me not to smoke, it's none of his business if I smoke or I don't smoke. And at that time my father was a tailor, a very good tailor. That what saved our life also in the Kovno ghetto. And he start work. He worked in -- in Ledz as a tailor, and he helped a lot of people from Lithuania, from Kovno that went through Lodz. He had a big apartment, and in -- the one -- that apartment, downstairs was a big room. I don't -- it was like a hole.

And they went through, and everybody knew him, because he was a very good looking man from Kovno, very well dressed, and always the best. And th-they came, and he would give them food, and he wouldn't let them go back to Lithuania, because he found out that it's not good there.

I went into the kibbutz, in -- to work in the hospital because I know how to give a injection, you know, I learned a little bit there at the Russian camp, by working with the animals, it's not that different to give a injection, and take a temperature, and so on. So I went into the kibbutz, and I stayed in the kibbutz, and I learned how to -- in Lodz -- and I worked in the hospital, and in Madrid the head of the kibbutz came to me, and he says, "Marsha," -- now, nobody knew my age.

Now, I want to tell you, my stepmother Rocholla, was with me in the same camp, and I helped her stay behind, because she froze her feet up. My feet were frozen, too. They took off her fingers from one foot, in Ledz, and she couldn't walk that fast. They wanted to take some of my toes off, and I wouldn't let them, because the doctor said there's a chance that they can heal that. So I went for therapy, and what I did is, I washed floors, I did everything to pay the doctor. And the doctor gave me therapy, hot and cold baths, and salves, and everything, and it starts -- it looked like I had a fungus on my foot, but it start healing. And I could walk. And then when I went into the kibbutz, the kibbutz paid part of it. So, in about two and a half months, my feet were ready to go.

One was shot in a -- in a bus stop, the other one was deesent, it was terrible.</p><p>For me, it was a terrible thing, because as bad as the Russian was, they never beat us, they never hurt us, they never shot us. So I went and I took that transport. And the Akar was shooting after us. It was in the middle of the night. And I -- ed -- everybody slowed down, and they were mad at me because of my stepmother. It didn't take long we arrived in Bratislav. Arrived in Bratislav, my father never said thank you to me for taking him, and everything else, but they put us on trains to go to Germany, and to go -- and it so happened that we went through Austria with the train. And they said, "Who would like to stay in Austria?" And I saw those beautiful mountains, and that beautiful scenery, and like I told you, at the Russian camp I was boar hunting, and I was riding, and I loved sports. Even as a child, when I was eight years old, I was at the school Olympics, you know. So what happened is is that I was a daredevil. I was a -- like I'm a tomboy when I was a youngster. Because there was a certain branch out from my wer -- my grandfather from my mother's side was a very well-to-do man, and I was his angel. It's supposed to be a boy, but still he called me by a boyish name, Yankela. But I was his life.

The teacher sits in front before you go out the door. So I took my thing that I was writing in, my book -- my pad -- my notebook, and I took it and J hit it at her, and I said, "I am leaving."

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I'm even driving a German car, because you cannot go on hating all your life, you only hurt yourself.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The other question I had was, did you ever meet a vakovna actually at that time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. Not till after eight years, or seven years I was in this country. I didn't even know survivor exist for about seven years in this country. That is another story.</p></p></dialogue>

Third place, he came from Yugoslavia, where the lot of his family was killed, too, in Novosad. And third place, he was a good looking man, he was well dressed, and he was clean. And that was the most important thing to me. I don't care if he would have been -- I don't know what.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So what were -- what were your plans eventually, then? You did not intend to stay in Austria?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Definitely not. Before I met Cornelius, I was the biggest Zionist that ever existed.</p><p>Smuggling the people over the border to Palestine. In fact, Ben-Gurion's what was his name, Shorette was at my wedding, and I was crying, because I had to go to America, because Cornelius" family was here. And he said, "Marsha, we need people like you in America, too. Don't cry." So it was a sadness to a certain extent, a sadness in me that I couldn't go to Palestine. But another thing I went to a country that I thought I would never got -- get to. You understand what I -- in a way it was selfish, but I was happy.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: We'll talk a little bit more about that when we -- when we get there. So how did you get there, actually? What -- what happened?</p></p></dialogue>

And then we got a letter that in 1947, when we got married, his mother and father were supposed to go through Vienna.

They shipped a lot of antiques, that my father- in-law was going to open an antique shop. I don't want to go into a big story about it, everything was stolen, and we couldn't rip -- we were making 30 dollars a week, and paid a private detective all over. Nothing was found except a couple of paintings that were between the bedding that came in those empty cases. So this is the first time I lost money, and I didn't feel sorry for me. I felt sorry for my mother-in-law, and father-in-law that had an estate with maids and chauffer, and two cars in Europe, you know what it means.</p><p>A Fiat, and a Chevrolet for the boys. And ift -- went to San Marco when David -- when Connor was three years old, and all over Switzerland, and Cornelius went to -- to college in Budapest, and to Switzerland, and -- very, very rich people.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So we came, and we went from Bindermichl, we went to Bremerhaven, and there's decided there is a boat going through New Orleans, if you -- and it would take 14 days rather than more. And we went on that boat. Then that was after -- we were married in deg47, that was in August 1949. And we went on the boat, and being that Cornelius spoke so many languages, he was invited as a interpreter to speak over the tape recorder, and we came on the boat early. Came in on the boat early, I was made shtudmarder -- the head of that old woman, barra -- because the women and the men slept separate. And I met the two Ire officers. And like I said, I was pretty good looking, had a good sense of humor, knew how to dance, I won a couple of contested. And that rock and roll in Austria.

And being in the theater, you know, and everything. And I made very good friends with the Ire officer. And I got very sick going through the channel, very sick. And, you know, being that Cornelius was with the Joint, and part director of the Joint Distribution Committee, I got an apartment in the displaced camp that they had a telephone. And through that I met a lot of black marketeers. Ve -- he never did it, because he was afraid, God forbid, he couldn't go to America. So even when he lost all his money, he wrote a letter to his sister-in-law, did my tuxedo arrive? She s -- she wrote him back, "Cornelius, with all the money that you have now, you don't need a tuxedo." The first thing didn't bother him, the money, or the diamonds, or everything else, it bothered him is the tuxedo. So what happened is is that when we lived there, and we had that telephone, a lot of black marketeers would come over and make telephone calls, and everything else. And they went to England, and they brought me beautiful clothes, you know, as [indecipherable]. But I had a maid from Dabotchka, Maria, I'1l never forget. And they would come in, and if I wasn't at home, and they would go into the kitchen in the displaced camp, I had a beautiful apartment -- Wiesenthal, from the -- from the Museum of Tolerance, lived above me. I gave him a party line, and I gave him a maid. And I wouldn't have anything to do with that man if he said boo.</p></p></dialogue>

And the thing is is that I had a telephone, I had all those clothes, we were on the boat, and I didn't know where Connor is, Cornelius didn't know where I -- all of a sudden I didn't know if I was in love with him, if I was not in love with him. And I start throwing up. And that Ire officer was already a little bit in love with me, I had a feeling. So he came down to the thing, and he picked me up -- at that time I was only a size seven. I wasn't what I was right n -- he picked me up, in that pink robe [indecipherable] and he gave me his cabin, and he went to live with the other Ire officer. And my husband, when I saw him on the deck, I got -- I got well after I saw him.

And varabul Connor start feeling better, I start feeling better. I had nice clothes, and I had that friend, that Ire officer. In fact, he came to Los Angeles one time, when I was very unhappy, because he left me a PO box, in case I'm not happy, to send him a letter. And I was unhappy because in the beginning we lived with our in- laws, and so on. So I was a little unhappy, till I got that letter, and he came over, and he said, "All you do, move out or I take Marsha with me."</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

It wasn't my fault, I didn't even want to sit there. Who cared if I'm in a magazine or not? All I was worrying, where is the next bread coming from? Where am I going to pay the detective to look for our stuff, and so on, you know. But at night -- she didn't live very far, and she would have an idea, she was very creative.

And in 1978, when we opened the museum, I was chairing it, and that why I wanted to interrupt you to tell you, you are -- you also ask me why am I mad at Wiesenthal, and I want to tell you why. Because before we opened the museum, Mr. Wiesenthal was supposed to speak for us. I shouldn't say that on tape, but I have to get it off my chest. And maybe I'll get fired for it, but I don't care. Before we opened the museum, Mr. Wiesenthal was supposed to speak for us. Our chair was Mr. Silverman, American Jew, and we had a meeting in his house. And I don't -- I forget the name from the old man that came, and said that he got a letter from Wiesenthal that he wants five dollars per head more, like cattle. And we couldn't even afford it to open the museum, how can we afford to give him five dollar more to be our -- our speaker at the mu -- at the big dinner, at the opening.</p><p>And then the Wiesenthal Center came to us -- that is now the Wiesenthal Center, with the proposition they" ll give us 25,000 dollars for him. And being that we couldn't get it more from the federation, because they gave us a lot, we sold Wiesenthal for 25,000 dollars to the Wiesenthal Center. The Los Angel -- at that time we were the Martyr's Memorial, and the Holocaust Museum, we just changed our name to the Los Angeles Museum of the Holocaust because it's much easier to -- to get to understand it.

I worked so hard for the Gateway of Mental Health hospital in Los Angeles. I and Cornelius were fundraising in the valley. So they surprised me on a television show. It was called at that time, "It Could Be You." And they told me I was going to have -- announce my fashion show, cause I'm giving for Gateway for mental health. And they came to pick me up, and then they surprised me with my father. And what happened is my father came, and he came into the -- to my house, and he says, "Oh, a Jewish girl, a bizdatnitsi, no children." And it practically killed me. So -- and then my mother-in-law and father-in-law was in a very, very bad accident, and the two sons were so good, and they were so terrific, and that day I decided -- and I knew my mother was -- just has to snap a finger, she had a baby.

And even in my house, in my first house, I had the early American. In my little apartment behind the studio, I had the early American with the hooked rug. And now I go a little more modern. I got used to America. Anyway, and what happened is is that I -- I -- I got pregnant, and I worked, and like I said, I brought my father out, and it upset me, and then when my mother-in-law was in the accident, I said when I'm gone there wa -- nobody going to be left, I have to have something. And I stuck it out, and David was born in the eighth month. And he was -- I took him out -- he was about five pounds, because at that time they just build the Encino hospital, and it wasn't far from my -- from my studio.

I went through eight months, and I'm going to kill you." So you see, because I've done so much in the concentration camps, and afterwards, with charity, with raising money, and everything else, said, "God couldn't do this to me again." And then, the hospital was so small, and I got terrible cramps. It was just built, and they brought in -- in the next room a woman from -- from surgery, she said, "Keep quiet." That lady just came out, she said -- I said, "But I'm wet." I didn't even know that you break water. I never read up on it. So they found Robert right away, and he brought with him two doctors, two pediatricians, and he was putting in that stitch, and I said, "Robert, are you knitting or purling?"

At three years old, he was -- he knew every president, he knew every composer. Now, he was not genius. I took him to UCLA. My father-in-law was a very, very intelligent man, and David was his life, so he spent a lot of time with David. David has -- has a photographic memory, like I do.

Yeah, my father- in-law should rest in peace, it was his life. One time he took a wooden spoon, and he hit him on the behind. I'll never forget, he called me up, and he said, "Appa," that's an Hungarian father, he said, "if you do it, it doesn't hurt." He loved him so much. In fact, I had to take him to the doctor that treated my father, because the day before he jumped on his bed and everything, and I heard him in his room praying, and he said, "Please God, if I did something wrong, bring my -- my grandfather back as -- as a baby again." So I took him to his doctor, to my father-in-law's doctor, and he told him, Dr. Cohen, that his grandfather was very sick, he could not survive, that, in fact, the last day he brought him a lot of joy by being there.</p></p></dialogue>

When -- when he wouldn't eat, I wouldn't say I was hungry, why don't you eat? When he didn't eat I would say, "David, you have to eat, there are so many children hungry in China." He said, "Why don't you adopt a couple?" That little fat monster told me that. But I never told David anything, anything. I never exposed him to it. David played Little League.

He played Little League, he loved sports, he did judo, anything. In fact, he was -- when he was very little, he was very smart, but not coordinated. To -- my doctor, Dr. Jessup, told me, "Why don't you take him boxing or judo?" So I took him for judo. So in the beginning he didn't want to go in because he didn't know how to tie his shoes. So I told him, "Then leave it open." But later on, this was the best thing that I ever did. But I never, never exposed him to the Holocaust before he was able to understand. And I won't tell any, any child about the Holocaust that is under 11 or 12 years old, because this is a very horrible story that happened, and it can affect their life. And especially my son, it was important to me that he doesn't feel guilty because of me. That he doesn't eat, or he doesn't eat. He didn't want to be a doctor, he wanted to be a sports re -- the reporter, fine. This is your life, you live it. At 21 he moved out of the house, we moved to the town house.

So I found a place that was glot kosher, and it just opened, the Ventura Club. And -- but everything they gave you, they did your flowers, I didn't like. They gave me hundred dollar deposit, I paid 500 dollars for flowers. Imported hats from Mexico, with everything Calypso, every color. I didn't like his orchestra, so I had another one for the grownups. I changed everything around. They were supposed to do everything, I did everything. But I liked. But it was a beautiful Bar Mitzvah. And, in fact, David was mostly an atheist. But now, as he is getting older, is very, very Jewish inclined. And I never pushed him, and I never told him you have to be, because when came Christmas, we were at my mother-in-laws. Came Rosh Hashanah, we were at my house.

I said, "Thanks a lot Mrs. Owens, you just did me a big favor. In front of all my clientele, you are telling me that." She took it out of the safe, and she brought it to me, and I read the story, when Hoover was in 1938 in Europe, and he came back, and he asked Roosevelt to do something about the Jews that are being killed in Europe.

The same museum that I helped build, and paid out thousand, and thousand, and thousands of dollars, I'm working that museum on a salary right now, through the federation, at my age. But I have to, and as long as I can drive, and as long as I can work, I will do it. Cornelius is still working again, too. But I'Il tell you something, maybe it makes us happier this way. Sometimes I'm very tired, I could hardly get done. Because a lot of people that work with me in the museum, that are in higher positions that I am, are very misunderstanding, and don't understand the feeling. And I've talked to somebody at the federation the other week, and he says to me, "We have a big problem here, Marsha." And he's right, psychologically, he said, "You are one of the high lite -- lay person, and now you're staff, and that is a big problem." And he says, "You can't stand anything that is wrong." And I said, "I can't, because you know, when I go out, and I raise in two days, four and a half thousand dollars to put up banners, I want to be consulted if the banners are alright or not, because three of them were made, and it was selected the worst of them." I said -- and that is what hurts me. That person that runs that museum, I cannot mention name, is very jealous of me, because when it comes -- anything that has to do with museum, everybody knows me, the whole community. Starting from the federation, to the - to-- to black young adults, African American, to teachers, to everything else.</p><p>Everybody knows me, and I hope they respect me, and that is the biggest problem.

I am the treasurer for many years. In 91, we honored Benjamin Meet, and Vlodka from the American gathering. Benjamin Meet is one of the greatest men that I've ever met, because he brought the survivors together. The first gathering that we went to was in Israel, the second one was in Washington.

I worked with, "The Triumphant Spirit," with Nick Decalsio on the book. And it bothers me when people -- like take the Hungarians, from Budapest I'm talking about. They didn't -- they -- they only start suffering in 1944, and they were put in the ghetto in 1944. But they also suffered, and a lot of them were killed in Auschwitz, and everything. But I don't think they went through the things that the people that went through -- that went through from 1939. Like, I couldn't say I went through like the Polish people that started 19 -- 9 -- deg39, or the German Jews. But the German Jews, in the beginning, before the Kristallnacht still lived pretty good.

But there is so many diaries been written, there's so many children been hidden, there's so many children been killed, like my two little sisters, one three years old, that was born in ghetto, that doesn't even know what it means that little piece of bread, one piece of fi -- a whole piece of bread, or a whole piece of -- of milk, or anything. But she knew every German. They were so smart, like God has give them more head, or something. Every German that walked by, she knew by name, when she was hidden. You know, because when they took away all the children, my biggest crime my mother committed is by hiding of my two little sisters. And that why she was killed at 34 years old, in Stutthof.

Even if you don't like what they tell you. Even if you feel guilty that you couldn't help them, that you didn't help them. You still have to have respect for what they made of themself. You take me, a little girl comes into -- married a guy that most of the family is Christian, I'm Jewish, very, very brought up Jewish, come from the concentration camps, my husband was in a labor camp. Thanks God my mother-in-law was very understanding and helped a lot of Jews, I told you she's a Righteous Christian and everything. But still, my brother-in-law was in America, having -- living a playboy life, you understand what I mean? And so on. And here comes that little -- poor little girl, you know. And thanks I God -- but I didn't let it happen to me. This is the survivor's spirit. I didn't let them think of me that he is better than I am. No. I am the one that is feared. I didn't fear him, he feared me. You know why? Because I didn't let him get away with it. Because I was better than he was. He didn't go through what I went through, and had to go to school and everything. His father paid for everything. I did it myself. Do you understand what I am talking about?

They had to bring up their family. A lot of the survivors were lonesome, so they got married just with anybody, you understand what I mean? Maybe they -- they didn't fit, but they made a life together, they brought up their children beautiful. The only thing that I don't agree, that most of the survivor pushed their children.

If somebody -- if you have teacher training like we have in the museum every year, a teacher training, and we do it with different agencies, like the ADL, the labor committee, the American Bureau of Jewish Education, we do it together, and that is very important. Teacher training, so the teacher knew, when it comes to history, that, like the Spanish Inquisition, and the Crusaders, this also has to be told in history, because it happened, and it happened to a people, and for no reason at all. And it's good for the people in America to know it, because like I said, it's such a melting pot, that the people should get along together properly.</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

This only happened 50 some odd years ago, and believe me, much, much more that happened on Yom Kippur. And I think the Yom HaShoah is the most important thing, for any religion, or any people. It's important for us Jews, but a lot of people should come and see it, and hear it. Because this is like going to temple on - - on Yom Kippur. This happened 2,000 years ago, but it's still the tradition, and we still do it. And people stand in line to get tickets to go to it. But the Yom HaShoah only happened 56 years ago, and six million of our people were killed. And that is -- that is our yom -- that is my Yom Kippur. Do you know in the beginning, before the survivors start dying off, I was jealous of a funeral, I told you on the tape. You know. And now, I'm afraid to go to funerals. I'm afraid to pick up the telephone, because the survivors are going so fast. And that why the testimony is so important, it's very important, that it shouldn't be forgotten. Look at what happened to the Spanish Inquisition. What do you read in the dictionary? A date, a time, what happened, and finished with. Are there books on it? Not many. And look at what happened, and it's practically forgotten. This will never be forgotten, as long as I can help it.</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

The "Schindler List," is the one that is the closest, and still it's still a movie. Let's not kid ourself. The best one that I ever saw was last month, "The Shoah," because it was interviews. And you see what interviews can do.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Of a master is right. And there's the -- you still see those little pieces of anti-Semitism was flying in the background, but people don't notice it, and -- certain people notice. And I think he did the best that ever was, I'm sorry. Spielberg was alright, I fainted, I went to the bathroom. I -- I never fainted in my life, but I -- all of a sudden I had to run to the bathroom and throw up. But I came back -- because I was the volu -- Los Angel -- Valley Times ask me I should get about three or four survivors at the opening of "Schindler's List," and then the lady interviewed us, the reporter, and I did, and I watched it, and I never watched it again. But I did interview survivors, and I've learned a lot from survivors by interviewing them, the 110 survivors.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And -- and what are --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: The shooting, and everything else, I've seen it. I've -- I -- I -- I went through it. You understand what I mean? You have to ask that from an American. You understand, Regina? But I personally, when the children on the cart, when they were carrying in that camp, this is what I couldn't take it.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Are there still some images and sounds, or so -- or memories that -- that -- that follow you to -- to this day?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes. My mother yelling to me, if you survive, Myashinka, go to Palestine, and find Soatsky. And that was my aunt in Israel, Sarah. And also another thing is when they separate me, the man and the woman, when they brought us to Stutthof in cattle cars, and they separated the man and the women, send my father to Dachau, and my mother and me and the kids to Stutthof, and my father was yelling, "Give us the poison tablets, give us the poison tablets. You don't want that." And my mothers said, "No. Even if a finger is left alive, 1 am going where the Jewish people are going." But let that end on a real happy thought. I'm an old lady now, I work. You see we live a pretty normal life, pretty American. My accent I couldn't get rid of, I went for speech therapy, I couldn't get rid of it, I'm sorry.

I don't, but I can't help it. And you see, I have a s-son, that goes -- you heard him go already twice since you are here. He lives in Las Vegas, he has his own life to live. And he comes -- is coming out now on my birthday, on the 28", cause I can not drive and fly by plane. And then, I don't like Las Vegas, it's too 1 -- noisy, and too much things. Last time I went to Las Vegas two years ago on Thanksgiving, and he had a stomachache. We were supposed to go out for Thanksgiving. So now I said forget it. If want to play cards, I go to one of the casinos, and that's all -- they're here in Los Angeles. I don't have to go and see those -- that they spend thousand -- there's so many thousands of homeless people lying around the streets all over America, and they're building millions and millions of dollars hotels in Las Vegas. Not that we don't need it, we need that too, but there is a limit to everything. Yesterday I went shopping. There were standing people, and collecting for AIDS, near Juan's. So I sent Cornelius in to get canned food for them. And I tried to give as much as I can. When I had the money, everybody got. But now I try to give as much as I can. In fact, somebody told me I'm too generous. Because when I drive by in the morning, I drive by a bakery that has bagels, and I had on a -- a -- a department in the federation, they used that I bring them bagels and cream cheese in the morning, for the department. So if -- if I can -- now we are separated, the federation and the museum, and in different places till the building is redone. So now I have to wait till somebody comes to pick it up, or I run over and take it over. And this is my biggest pleasure, even if it costs me money, that I work, and it comes to me very hard. But this is my pleasure.</p><p>This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: [indecipherable] what -- what else gives you pleasure? What --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: What gives me pleasure? Like I told you, I had my studio, and I did a lot of knitting, so I do that a little bit, and it gives me pleasure to go to art show, museums. And it give me pleasure to -- do you know what I like to watch? This is the craziest thing, the classic movies, the old movies. Isn't that ec -- that relaxes me. And after reading a Holocaust book, or something else, I buy myself a little romance book, to relax me. So I lay down in bed, and Cornelius watches television downstairs, and I read that -- and I go from the first page, to the middle, to the last page, to know what the ending is. And that relaxes me, and I fall asleep with it.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's -- that's fast reading. My last question actually is you mentioned before that you learned from the Holocaust survivors a lot. Think -- think about a few examples.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: An example is that I learned that they are -- some are very, very -- how do you say it -- how do -- | -- say -- some are very depressed, and very down, and you have to be around them, but it happens very seldom to pick them up. I also learned that when I go to a party, they dress like young girls, 70 and 75 year old women. They want to stay forever young, because they never had a childhood. And they never had, really, a young life, because they had to work, and bring up a family, and everything else. To me, being a designer, it hurts my eyes. But I know what they feel, psychologically. The third thing is what bothers me tremendously is that the survivor money is handled by Americans. And that This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

I get - - I got a call from a 91 year old woman that has nothing to eat. A survivor.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Because of the so -- it takes -- it takes them too long to process it, or that it's not enough --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, it's not enough. What -- what can she do, a woman, she's 91 years old, she needs some help. She needs somebody to help her, or be put in a home. Or when a survivor goes into a state home, and there is millions of dollars in -- in New York. A survivor should never, after what they went through, stay in a state home, should be treated completely different. Not because he's a survivor, and he's something special. He should have -- his end should be easy on that person, if it's a man or woman. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I am expecting too much.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But how -- how --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Like we're getting the money from Switzerland, and it's going on education, it's going on everything else. But they don't remember when they tore my earrings off my ear. And my little ring that my grandfather gave me to get away. And I didn't want to give it, and my mother said, "Give it to them, give it to them." They don't remember when they told us if you don't bring in your goods, plus your ironing, plus our electrical appliances. Not only the gold, and the silver, and the platinum, the electric appliance and everything, youll be shot. Everybody's forgotten that. And they say that the Jews are greedy, because we -- we -- we -- we ask what is belonging to us, that's coming to us. They haven't seen nothing from it yet. Not for me. I need it, too, believe me I do. Driving This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Today was supposed to be a meeting in my house, we're honoring a survivor that's going to be 90 years old. We honored Latka and Benjamin Meet in -- in 1991. We -- we do a lot of vienna poldi, fill a page for doing "Schindler's List." The council is very important, we are involved with the money to distribute for the needy survivors.</p></p></dialogue>
