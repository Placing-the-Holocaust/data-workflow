<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's why I tell people. Nobody knows how. I tell them. All right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Very good.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: By the way, in case you want to know, Schore is a Hebrew word. It means ox.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It means ox, okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's my husband's name, of course.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Lichtenstein, in German, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Where in Germany are you from?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Berlin.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: From Berlin. Can you tell us a little bit about your childhood in Berlin? How much you remember</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: [remember almost everything from then and then later on it gets vague.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The microphone was clipped to your jacket.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Where do you want me to put it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Maybe on your shirt, if you don't mind, so you can clip it to your shirt. All those technical things. Sorry.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="0"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Technical problems.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Let me do that. I will put it on your collar. That is probably going to be the best place because it's out of the way. So you mentioned that you were raised in Berlin?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Ina nice, comfortable middleclass family. My I have no sisters or brothers. I'm an only child. I don't even have a first cousin. And to jump ahead, I now have eight greatgrandchildren, which is more than most people can say, I think. And I may have more because I still have one grandchild who is not attached yet.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Okay. I grew up in this comfortable home with a kinderfraulein.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That means the nurse?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Nanny. They were not always nice, those kinderfraulein, but we were always comfortable. And I went to kindergarten and to elementary school there, and 1 my father died when I was three. So my grandfather was a male presence in my family, and I adored him, and he was a lovely man, and my mother was a very young widow and had her own problems. And I went on to a Jewish school after leaving elementary school because they were there. And by that time, we moved to the area called Grunewald on the Roseneck, which is quite a smart area in Berlin. And I stayed there. And then, at the very end, by that time I was over 14, they stuck me in an art school because I was extremely talented, they tell me, but I never got anywhere with that. I did some posters later on. Anyhow, by the time the socalled Kristallnacht, which wasn't called that in Berlin, you understand. That was put on to that episode by the American press, that expression.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And, anyhow, I remember where we lived, there was one Jewish jeweller on the corner at the Rosenach, and they had forgotten it was supposed to be a spontaneous uprising.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Except they forgot that one store. They came the next day and bashed it up.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: So that was that. And I was comfortable. We took summer holidays in interesting places. The Baltic. And dances where my grandfather's family came from. We went to Sarkot and stayed and went swimming. It was a peaceful, pleasant time.</p><p>And then, of course, again, after this, you know what happened, my mother rushed about getting me onto a Kindertransport, and she succeeded.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="1"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: How old were you when that happened?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: 15. I was one of the older children. Right now, I am one of the oldest ladies here, I think, by far.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, and it doesn't show at all.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Good for you. Thank you. But 1am. And when we went swimming last summer, my son and I, in the Atlantic, he kept on telling me, Don't swim out so far. Remember, you're 36 86andahalf, which he rubbed it in a little bit.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: That's a good problem to have, not to swim out to</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I'm here, and I'm fairly well. And I had a little lumpectomy, which ladies get, but you know that. Okay. In the meantime, they sent me off in Berlin in May of "39.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, just to come back a little bit more to your background in Berlin. So, you come from a middleclass, fairly welloff family. You attended most of your schools in Berlin, then, right?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you are the only child. And you are very in touch with your grandfather?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And not so much</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My mother was a little bit difficult, but this is really too long. You don't want to go into all that. But anyhow, she took me to the station where we were leaving, and I was very happy talking to a school fellow school girl that had gone to the same classes I did.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>We were talking, and my mother all of a sudden started yelling that I had to go and sit next to her because she finally got emotionally involved in this departure. Okay. We got on the train. On the next station, my aunt, whom I loved very much too, was there to wave goodbye to me. She was eventually she lived in France, and the French police addressed arrested her and sent her to Auschwitz where she was murdered --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I see.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: inthe "40s. Okay. Then I was got to London. First, we went by boat to from where did we leave from? To Harwich from Hook Von Holland, I think, and then to Harwich, and then by train to London, Euston Station, I think.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And were you you seemed to be happy to be on the train, or am I</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I was not miserable.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Not miserable.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And there was lots of young people, and we sang songs on the trip.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And you weren't did you</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I was not afraid. I was not petrified. I had they said people should come with woolsack. Everybody else had suitcases. I had a woolsack because my mother followed the rules. Okay. In London I was picked up by a lady who ran a girl school in East Molesey in Surrey.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, the county, right?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. And so she picked me up. And I had English, I had English for a couple of years and I had French more, but that didn't do me any good there. And then she took me to this East Molesey girl school. It was called Mildred's Lodge. And one of the ladies here was there as well, and I remembered her. She didn't remember me, but that can happen.</p><p>So we were there, I would say, for quite six months, I would think, something like that, and I was sent to an art school in somewhere near there. I can't remember the name now of the town.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So they apparently thought you were talented as well?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was talented, but then, you know, if you don't make use of it, it fades. Anyhow, they were there was the school had a dance or something, and one of the boys afterwards called me, and that was a great scandal. And the lady who had looked from Germany who had looked after us not looked after us, but promoted the whole thing, she said stay away from men. They only want one thing. You know, the whole routine. Before your time, thank God. Anyhow, I think I was after spending holiday in Devonshire, or was it I don't remember now. Mrs. Atkinson, who was a marvelous Quaker lady, who walked around with what is that called?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I don't know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In German, it's schnecke.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Oh, like little buns? She had little</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Snails. She wore silver buckles on her shoe, and she had a lovely house in the country and many sons, and they had a badger in a garage or in a barn. It was fairly interesting, and I liked it there. So we had a holiday there. Then after that, I think they didn't want me in that school anymore.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Because of the dance?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because of that boy's phone call. Big deal. But it was a different time, and those people were different people.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Okay. Then they stuck me somewhere in Hampshire with an old lady and her daughter. They had seven cats. And they didn't order much milk. It was a tower that had been built by Pitt, I think, against Napoleon, the expected invasion.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mmhmm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And it was three stories, one on top of the other. It wasn't very wonderful. There was no indoor plumbing. But it was still summer, so it was all right. After awhile, that didn't seem to be a solution. And they stuck me with a vicar in a town called Lockerley.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Why did they move you to the vicar?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Who knows. I wasn't always consulted.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see. It seemed that you didn't really bond with those people that you stayed with, right?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Never, no. And the people that the lady there, the vicaress, if there is such a word, there isn't, but the lady, she had four daughters, and her husband was not allowed to smoke in the house, which was good. He smoked a pipe. His sermons were very poor. I had enough English by then, but I went to the sermons. I went to church when they had services because it was the only entertainment then. After that, somehow was it a joint committee who used to transfer people? You don't know about that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah, that is somewhat obscure, but I think that's</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: It's in London. And they moved me on to North Hampton where I got stuck for awhile longer, and there was a curate who took me in. Curate is an assistant vicar.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And she was a very glamorous lady, and he was a very sweet man. Their name was Evans. I remember that. And so I stayed with them, again being sent to art school. I don't think it really knocked in, you know, kicked in at all.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It didn't?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, I don't think so. But anyhow, it was all right. It was tiresome.</p><p>Among the other interesting things, this may interest you, your group, there was a rabbi.</p><p>And because in in North Hampton. And he wore a clerical collar. I don't know if anybody else ever told you that, but it is a very unusual thing for a rabbi to do, but he said the other clergyman, they wore a clerical collar, so he did too. This was an edification on his part.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="4"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I see. That is actually pretty unusual.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Mighty unusual.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So okay. So I spent some time there. And then my mother kept running to London to the America she was by that time she had come to England.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did she manage to do that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Domestic VISA.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So she was probably one of the early people who managed to get on</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: She came very late, just before the war started.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you came on the first was it one of the first transports? Was it still in winter?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, no. In May. The first one started in, I think, November or December.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I think it was somewhere around that time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. So, anyway, my mother kept going to London to the American Embassy. And somehow I don't know how that all worked out, but they found out that when I was born, my father was an American citizen. He had lived in America for 25 or so years. He went back to Germany to visit relatives after World War I, met my mother in doesn't matter where Quebec.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Was he also</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And they got married.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was he also Jewish or not?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yes, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: He was?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. And, again, my mother was cute, and he was a nice man, and I think she wanted to be on the only girl on the block to be married to an American. I'm pretty sure that was anyhow, they were married. I was born 10 months later. And, again, my father died when I was three, which was not a really terrible, you know. Anyhow, so after that now we're jumping back. I'm sorry. I'm not going chronologically.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's okay. But at least we are coming back.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In the meantime, the American Embassy found out. There was a new law on the books, the Nationality Act of 1940, and that because when I was born, my father was an American citizen, I could be an American citizen.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, that was a good thing at the time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was very interesting. It was I was given a passport, but only if I left England. Soa cousin and uncle took me to the railroad station. I went to Wales. I took a ferry from Wales to Dublin.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mmhmm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I went by train from Dublin to Galway.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And where is that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In Ireland.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In Ireland, mmhmm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Far western Ireland. And there was a ship leaving for the U.S. and I can't remember the name. It may have been Washington or I don't remember. And they were full of Americans who were going to America, but they were only just Americans. Many were born there, and then the parents moved back to Europe or whatever. And some of them were Americans who were on summer holiday. Now, the war had started. They were insane. And the ship I went on to finally was stopped by a German submarine already off the coast of Spain or Portugal, I think. So, anyhow, we got there. They had covered up the swimming pool with planks and put cots on there for all these people to go back to America.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So your mother was also on the ship with you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My mother stayed in England. And I had great fun on the boat after I stopped being seasick. And there were many young people on it. And then, when I got to New York, in those days, they didn't let young women off ships because they were afraid of white slavery.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, yes, mmhmm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Except nobody paid any attention to me, and there I was standing on the pier in New York and nobody was there to meet me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And who was there supposed to be?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My uncle had been sent he had just come from France, and he was sent a telegram, but which obviously didn't get there. It was war time</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: in England. That was another thing that was interesting. From England, I was with my gas</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: With your?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: gas mask. And I had to hand it in. And then in Ireland, everything was lit up, which made an enormous change after the blackouts of London.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Or North Hampton or wherever. Anyhow, nobody was there. And I was 16, and it was quite worrisome, you know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I could only imagine.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. And then, being new to New York who knows that there are five boroughs and five telephone books, so I tried to find my uncle and of course he didn't have a phone, I will tell you why later, and I did find an aunt, cousin of my father's, who had started a boarding house. And she was not surprised to hear from me, and she said, "Well, take a trolley car, blah, blah, blah." I was much too sophisticated. I put my luggage in storage, and I took a taxi.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you obviously had money, then, with you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Enough money for that. And so she I went to her house, I found it. And then she took me by trolley to my uncle's rooms. He was also rooming in some other boarding house. I mean, these people had just gotten here, you know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And until the day he died, he denied, but he looked at me I was 16 by that time and curvy. When he'd last seen me, I was 12 and a skinny little thing, and he clicked his heels, and he introduced himself, Schneidermul (ph), that was his name. He didn't recognize me for obvious reasons. And then his wife came home, and she dealt with the situation. They stuck me somewhere in a room. And then I was handed on to one of these something of Jewish Council of Jewish Women. They took a little care of me. I got put into you know, being a nanny or babysitter, whatever it was at that time. I don't remember. It was the summer. It gets very hot in New York in the summer. It was a big surprise Washington was worse, I think. And so they stuck me somewhere. It was all right. And then things get a little vague now. I don't remember everything. But I spent time with these people and then somehow the they sent me to art school again no, wait a minute. I went to high school then for a little bit. For a yearandahalf or so, I went to high school.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Through the association, right?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They pushed me into it. But the thing is, I was never a very great student as a child, but in New York, I was fabulous. I was a very good student.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, very good.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [had an education behind me, but that was it. And after that, I think I got, again, as my mother used to say, from Pontius to Pilate, they sent me around. And I got funny things. I think I started working somewhere. At Revlon, not for very long. Eventually I found a job at a printing outfit, and there I was a stripper. Haha. It's not a joke there. It was something you do. Layouts, it was called stripping. So I use that because it's really amusing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So I assumed that. So what were you exactly stripping? Boxes out of lids or what?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. Stripping is to put it was called photo offset printing, lithography. And they did something called Goldenrod, and the film on which the stuff was printed was cut out and that was called stripping.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Stripping.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And then they put it on a press. Not a letter press, on a circular thing. And it was run on the letter press after that. And my husbandtobe was working there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So your husband number three, you said?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, not yet.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, to be, you said. Okay. I'm sorry. I misheard you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: My husbandtobe, and he was a very nice fellow, and eventually we got married. By that time, my mother had come from England. And I think that's about it. We were married. We lived in New York. We got another apartment, which was</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: There are some gnats here.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Flies, whatever, yeah. We got another apartment. I had two children. My son's name is Robin, and he is now 65, going on 66.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Roman Catholic, okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We all lived in Manhattan, and then my son went into the Army during the Vietnam War. But he was not shipped for Vietnam, fortunately. He was leading two trains back and forth with prisoners and stuff like that, I think. I don't remember now. And both children are married. My daughter is two years younger than my son, and they both had nice weddings.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah, that's quite</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Which is my claim to fame. And they're all wonderful and adorable and cute. And they're all little girls except one little boy, which is also surprising. And I think that's about the end of the story. I'm here. I'm coping. I moved from New York to New Jersey six years ago because my children got tired of taking the Cross Bronx Expressway or the the what is the other bridge? The Verrazano Bridge. And now from the Christmas in Berlin, I now have Christmas in New Jersey and I had it in New York, and everybody comes. The new house is somewhat small, so we don't even have room for all the presents, and we have to stretch the walls.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, that's a good problem to have, though, not enough room for all the presents.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: A lot of people by Christmas, I have, like, 1820 people, which is a lot for this little condo that I live in.

When the children went to school, my husband gave me a present of a pair of really cruddy Japanese binoculars, individual focus, really terrible, and we were going with friends on a Mother's Day, "36 or so.</p></p></dialogue>

And the first</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> </p><p> two birds I saw were Rosebreasted Grosbeak and a Magnolia Warbler, and I was seduced. I mean, I couldn't ever figure on anything better than to go out and look at birds.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So that has been my passion. I've traveled all over the world now.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Watching birds. But I also do flowers and other I'm a naturalist now, you know, in quotation marks. Not by training because I my education is painfully neglected, but I can read and write, and I can look at birds, and I can look things up.</p><p>And the trips that I've taken, I mean, even traveled together, my husband and I when he was still well, and then he had four primary cancers, and the last years were impossible.</p><p>He was very, very ill.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And all watching birds, right?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Almost always, yeah. It was very exciting. Now I'm getting a little old for that kind of crap excuse me, excuse me. AndI whatever I do, there are a little far fewer birds, but it's still a passion for me. And ifI I have a feeder three feeders outside four feeders.</p><p>And I watch whatever comes in the yard socalled yard. And I garden a little now. In other words, my life is okay. It isn't stimulating where I am. It's bland. It's a senior retirement community.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, not everyone's life is extremely stimulating. I would say the majority has a normal have a normal life, right?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't know. Other people play bridge, tennis, golf. None of the above. I don't do any of those things. IfI don't go birding, I read.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's right. But where I live now, it's too far to go to the beach. I used to go to Jones Beach or Petre Island, Gratiot, and now that is too far for me, and I go swimming in the pool. But I still drive and not at night. I've decided to stop driving in the dark. It's not such fun.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's harder. It's not as the visibility isn't as good, right, at night?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It's a little bit dangerous, I think, for other people too.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I will think about it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You're not there yet. Wait until you're 86andahalf. Okay.</p></p></dialogue>

And they people came out from Europe and said this is going on and nobody listened. They couldn't believe it because it is unbelievable.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, that's true.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I went to Yad Vashem, and my husband who came from Eastern Europe, when he was born, it was Russia. By the time they left after World War I, it was Poland. And he was a very sweet man and my children adored him. After awhile when people get sicker, they don't get nicer.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's true. What was he called? What was his name?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p>Did you try did you try to help your mother arrive to England? Try to work some paperwork</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I wasn't consulted. I don't know. I was told she was coming and that's before the war started. So she really got out in the nick of time. And when she came to America, I picked her up at some kind of gathering point.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you know how she managed to get to America?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The [have no idea it's too I don't remember now. But eventually she remarried.</p><p>And I told you already that?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [have two stepbrothers late in that life. By then, I had children so it wasn't so entertaining anymore. And they her husband and she bought a very small house in Florida, and she was very happy there. Loved the gardening. And it was very nice. Then we went down every Easter to visit and later on. We went down because she was sick.</p><p>She had a heart condition, so I had to keep flying down and got another caretaker for her, and she was never comfortable or happy, and she didn't live very long. She didn't live to see her first grandchild greatgrandchild. Sorry.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's unfortunate. Did you get to be any closer with her after she arrived to the States?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="12"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, I even went to Cambridge to visit with her. She's I didn't mention this, but anyhow, she was the world's worst cook, but she became a cook in England. Somebody some very welloff people, and she cooked from the cookbook. She could do that. And the lady came from somewhere in Germany also, and she said we saved onethirtieth of our fortune.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's good.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So that's interesting too. We stayed in touch. When I came to America, I didn't write nearly as often as I should have. It wasn't a happy time. Do you understand? I dealt with it, but it wasn't a happy time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, I can only try to imagine. You probably were all left to yourself, and you had to start your new life in America, right?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And with all the I mean, it was such abrupt experiences from moving from Europe and, you know, leaving war behind. You mentioned that one person from your family was sent to a concentration camp, right?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was Tante Frieda, my mother's sister. She was in France and the French police took her. Really awful, really awful.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: But my uncle and his wife he was in one of the French camps in near Paris, but</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did they survive?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They got out. He was the one who was supposed to meet me in New York, but he didn't.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, that's the one, that's the only one.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="13"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The other, they were family went to Stedishav (ph). One survived, and the others, I guess, were starved to death is my thinking. And this other uncle who took me to the railroad station, they came from Dunwich. So he and his family all survived. One of the cousins went through the war with her mother, and she got cancer. And I think, according to a story, she was raped by the Russians when they came in. So that's but you hear this you know, these stories did happen.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right, they did.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And she had a child apparently that was lost during that time, which is really worse than what happened to me, much.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And there were four cousins, and we were all friends, and we went to for summer holidays, and they lived in Dunwich, and two of them are still alive.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you keep in touch with them?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I that's another story. I don't know if you've got time for those stories?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: [have lots of time as long as you have a little bit of time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [have to eat lunch soon. I went to India, and I decided I had to go by way of London, and I was going to stop and visit with this cousin, and he picked me up at the airport and took me to a motel, and we visited. And the next day they gave me a very big treat. They took me to the British Museum, which I loved. This is fine. But while we're having a small snack, my bag was gone with everything, everything, everything you can imagine in it, mainly the passport and the VISA for in India, and it was really quite awful.</p><p>And so we went from there to the American Embassy, Grosvenor Square, where they wouldn't let me in because I didn't have identification. Well, if I had identification, I wouldn't have to be there. So anyhow, finally somebody came out and let me in, and they started the process of giving me a temporary passport, and I had to go and get a picture taken, all that. It was a major mess. And then the next day I thought I would not be able to get into India because of British the Indian High Commission is closed, but it was open on Saturday. So I went there, another cousin took me, her sister, and I waited because he had to go and get money. For some reason or other, the banks were closed or something. I don't know. It could happen. And anyhow, I waited and waited and waited, and they got very tired of having me sit there, and I really wanted to get out of there. So eventually I got the VISA into my new passport. And then, the next day I was going to India and the plane was supposed to leave at 8:00 9:00 in the morning, but it didn't leave until 6:30 in the afternoon, so I sat at the airport for many hours, and my cousin brought some money so I could buy a lipstick and a comb. You know, this is basics.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="14"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It is.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. Anyhow, I didn't have glasses. I didn't have hearing aids. I didn't have my address book. I didn't have my house keys for when I came back.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, my.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: This was it's nothing to do with the Holocaust. It's just a major catastrophe that affected me deeply. Then I went to India and the group leaders had money so they advanced me money, then at the end I sent them a check. That can be done. And I sent my cousin money, but he had a special arrangement and didn't want to lose any money on the deal. Anyhow, it all worked out. India was interesting. Very cold. We were there in January up near the Himalayas. Which has nothing to do with what you're interviewing me with.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So I was asking about your cousins, but I guess you do keep in touch with your cousins, right?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: This story has something to do with this. I get this Kinderlink. This is a newspaper that's sent out by, you know, this group.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That organization, mmhmm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And I came across a note from a man, the Reverend somethingsomething. And he was looking for somebody named who used to be Getruhm (ph) and then his name may have been something else and they changed it, but anyhow I knew that is my cousin in London. And I sent him an email, and he got back in touch with this fellow. Now, from when he was a child, he was Gebcarl (ph). And in the meantime, he changed his name to Charlie, and his last name from RUHM, which was my grandmother's maiden name.</p><p>Yes, the family name. They're married, by the way. And they got in touch, and he was enormously pleased.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Good.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It's all the Kinderlink did it. I never had anybody that I had anything to do with before. That was a first major deed that I could do through that. So he and I are now we corresponded off and on. We send each other Christmas cards. Haha, we do send Christmas cards.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But you do practice Jewish religion, right?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You don't. Did you come from a religious house?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="15"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: No? In your home, your mom?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Christmas trees.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Oh, so you were would you call yourself assimilated pretty much? That you</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Absolutely. My greatgrandparents had Christmas trees. This goes back long ago.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>And then we were faced with being Jewish when this all started.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: The war started, I see. So, essentially, you were really mixed in the German society, right, before</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Until they started getting rude or, you know, things started happening.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. Until the nationalism started to rise, right?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I have one more question if you wouldn't mind answering it. It's probably, I don't know, maybe a little bit more personal than the other questions. I wanted to ask if you think that do you think that being on the Kinderstransport had I mean, I've heard different stories so far. Did it have maybe any negative or positive impact on who you are right now or how your life turned?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It doesn't affect it affected me. I can't say if it's either positive or negative. It just happened and you deal with it. Some people don't, you know. A little noise, okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Just a little bit.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It wasn't again, when I first got to England, I cried a lot.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were the people in England nice to you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Some were. Some were not.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The families that you stayed with?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I never stayed with the two except a few. Mostly they were quite all right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did they try to make it really easy on you? Did they put any effort?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't think they paid that much attention. People can be very detached.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So they were just accommodating you, essentially? Is that what you would call it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I don't know why they took me in, but they did. I think there must have been the churches probably passed around Church of England probably passed around requests, you know, who would take a child, and I was there. I was taken.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see, yeah. Did you make any friends during your stay in England?</p></p></dialogue>
