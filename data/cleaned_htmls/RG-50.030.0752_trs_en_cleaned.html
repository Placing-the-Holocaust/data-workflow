<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, the Russian Army came close, took over just about all of Poland.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And you can hear the rifle shots, and the Germans took out the whole tent, with the exception of some very sick people that were left there. And we start walking. We didn't know where we were going or nothing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So which camp was this?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: This was Blechhammer.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was it difficult to walk?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was difficult to walk. Mainly, we walk on the main streets, where the German Army started retreating. We walked alongside the ravine, so to speak, you know, alongside that main street. And there were guns, but the Russians machine gun the area where the Germans were walking. And occasionally, they hit us as we were walking.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can | interrupt just for a second?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The Russian Air Force was flying overhead and had machine guns, primarily, aimed at the Germans. So they had German guards with machine guns watching us. So they kind of machine gunned along the line of the prisoners.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Isee. So they must have been flying pretty low, and it was nevertheless dangerous because you were walking right next to them --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- on the side of the road?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Correct. So occasionally, they killed some prisoners. I don't think they could have helped it. They were aiming at the guards, primarily, and they carried guns, machine guns and rifles and so on to watch the prisoners. And we walked.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In-- very skimpy, in the prisoners" uniforms that we wore. Myself, personally, I had a -- I happened to have a sweater somehow. I don't remember how I got it. And I wore that sweater. And I also wore bags, you know, the empty bags of cement as protection to keep warm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you would wear that under the uniform?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yes. Oh, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And what kind of footwear did you have?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Myself, I had a pair of boots somehow I got, and there were no soles on them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, my.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So you know, they were very skimpy. It was actually -- you know, we got all wet.</p><p>My feet got all wet. And well, I didn't have any shoes. So I wrapped, you know, some of the stuff, my feet in cloth, that I could find or whatever I could get, you know, so my feet wouldn't freeze.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So when you were walking along the side of the road, and it was January, and there was the machine gunning from the Soviets, and the Germans as well, were there snow drifts? Was it loud? Was it icy?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. We actually walked not on the outside of the road, because it was impossible to walk, but we walked on the main road to the side.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And of course, the guards moved in among the prisoners. So you know, I guess they must have hit some prisoners.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Isee. So the guards would realize this, and then they would intermingle with the prisoners?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: With the prisoners, correct.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Isee. And by that point, were there a lot of German guards, or was it few and far between?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, it was a lot of guards. Again, they carried machine guns. However, you know, the roads were full of people going west, because the Russians were right behind us. So we could hear rifle shots from time to time. So they were very, very close behind us.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you were about to talk about one Sunday you ended up someplace.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: One Sunday, we ended up in a barn. I don't know where that was. And they gave us coffee.

There were all kinds of people that walked, because they were trying to avoid the Russians, you know, particularly if they were Germans, you know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It sounds like chaos.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, it was, absolutely. And we had Russian prisoners, and you know, all kinds of prisoners walked alongside of us. The road wasn't big enough for all of these people that walked, including the German Army.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell me this, how many lanes did it have, or at least the main roads you were on?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>Were they single lanes, one in each direction, or were they wider than that?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Ibelieve they were wider than that. I'm not sure, you know. Again, we were fighting for our lives. We didn't pay attention too much of what was going on around us, except, you know, we tried to hide from the bullets.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>

You know, the food was very scarce. I was in one of the areas where you ate in one of the farms that we walked in. I saw a house, people, that the farmer, I guess, lived in. And I run to the farmer, knocked on their door asking for food, for bread. And the commander, so to speak, the person in charge of the prisoners, he said, What are you doing here, in German. And I said, I would like to have something to eat. So that young woman -- it was a young woman. He said, he says, you can give him bread, provided that you sleep with me tonight.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So she says okay. And she gave me a loaf of bread. And when I went out, I got hit over my back with a cane.

We were there for almost about a week. And that was Gross-Rosen. And Gross-Rosen was very secluded, because they had -- they were mining marble in that area. So the people on the outside couldn't see what was going on there in that -- in Gross-Rosen. And you know, after five days or so, a week maybe, maybe longer, they loaded up -- they loaded us up on the freight trains. They were going and taking the marble to market, I guess. And they loaded up the prisoners on these open freight trains, and they took us. We didn't know where we were going, and with guards on them. Each car had two guards with machine guns or regular guns. I'm not sure what. At that time, I wasn't really familiar with the weapons.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. Just that they can kill.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right. So they -- when they loaded us up, we were on the way. And we got all the way to Weimar where we were bombed. I think the allied's air force made a mistake and didn't know who it was, because they did see guards watching these things, you know, and they bombed the train. A lot of Germans, the guards, including the prisoners, were killed, a lot of them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. And this was allied bombing?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: This was allied bombing. I don't know what air force that was there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But primarily, I think the U.S. Air Force was in that area, or the U.S. Army was in that area, you know, so.</p></p></dialogue>

Can I interrupt you for a minute.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Sure.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did the train go until Weimar, the Town of Weimar, or did it go up to the camp at Buchenwald?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: To my knowledge, the railroad into Buchenwald, the railroad tracks, to my knowledge, if I remember right, were bombed out. So they took us by truck.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Isee. I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Into Buchenwald. It was not all that far.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No, no. It isn't that far.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So in fact, we used to walk it after the war. Because Buchenwald is in the mountains, and this is below the mountain. So from there, we were there, I don't know, from January until April.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you were in Buchenwald for all that time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yes, and we were in what is called a children's barracks. It had three -- I think they had three or four barracks where they kept just children. And I guess, there was a whole story behind it, because the -- also Germans, since the 1930s, were -- they were prisoners.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes. In Buchenwald, it had had a lot of German political prisoners.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right. So they sort of protected, to my knowledge, the kids. And at the time that they tried to take the kids out, we went to this appellplatz, and you know, we all lined up.</p><p>This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

What happened in the interim, I don't know.</p><p>I guess they had -- they had, within the prison, you know, people that carried guns. In fact, outside of Buchenwald, there was an ammunition factory.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Now, I'ma little confused at this point. When you were in Buchenwald from January to April, --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- who was in control?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, the Germans were in control. However, there also, since the factory where most of the German prisoners worked, and the other prisoners, I don't know which one of the prisoners they kept work in the ammunition factory, they smuggled in a lot of arms, the Germans.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And to my knowledge, they had Germans with guns roaming the prison. So I guess, the Germans feared a lot that the prisoners, whether it was the Germans or Russian prisoners, I don't know, but I know there were Germans.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay. But when you are saying Germans, are you talking about German political prisoners or --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: German political prisoners that smuggled in arms.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, I see what you are saying. They were working in the ammunitions factory.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Inthe ammunitions factory.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: They were smuggling in some arms that were kept secret from the authorities?</p></p></dialogue>

As soon as the Germans left, they took over.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Isee. As soon as the regular Nazi, you know, they left, then these political prisoners</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes, these political prisoners came out and tried to help -- they were not just Germans. They were all kinds of prisoners. There were Swedes, and they had Danes. I don't know where -- the Danes I can understand, but I don't understand the Swedes, how they got there.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, because they are supposed to be neutral.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right. I don't know how they got there, but they had them there. So and the reason I know that to be a fact is because I was hospitalized. I had extreme diarrhea that they -- I begged them to take me away already. I couldn't take it anymore.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Iremember that part in our conversation before, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Right. So --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And what was -- what did you do and your brother when you were there? Were you also put to work or --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- or not?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. In Buchenwald, we didn't work.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Isee.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: At least the time, the period of time that I was there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Isee. Okay.</p></p></dialogue>

People cut out the innards of the dead and ate, you know. This is the kind of stuff that I saw. It was a matter of either dying or doing that, so.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What about, when you say that the Nazi authorities left and the political prisoners took over, could you say that they liberated -- the German political prisoners liberated the camp, or was it another army that did it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no. I think it was -- I can't think of the general's name that came in. Let me kind of put a little emphasis on the whole situation, the whole picture there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They had a -- if I can remember the town -- Erfurt.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Erfurt, yes, is near there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was in the mountains, across the mountains. You could see from Buchenwald all the way into the mountains of Erfurt. They had a battle going on in Erfurt. At night, we used to see the cannons going off, the artillery going off at night from Erfurt, because it lit up. So the general who was the tank commander, and I can't remember his name. My memory is not like it used to be.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's easy to find out though. We can look it up, you know, who that would have been.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, he got killed in Germany in a car crash or something. I'm not sure how he died, the general.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: He was in charge of the tank unit that came into Buchenwald.</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

There was just a tank came in with a couple -- they opened the turret, and they peaked out. And the Germans were already gone. They jumped off the guard towers, and the prisoners were chasing them. You know, so they caught some. You know, it was all chaos, you know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They killed some, you know, and they brought some back to prison. So they -- the Germans were gone.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The army came in and -- the American Army came in, and of course, they start giving us food, you know, rations and stuff like that. And then organizations came in from western Europe that fed us after a while. So but as a whole, Erfurt, they were there for about a week or maybe more. They were shooting at the Germans across the mountains, and you could see it. At night, you could see it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So when they finally came into the -- into Buchenwald itself, the tank and with the solders, --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: The tank, yeah, with the people in it, opened the turret and looked out.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And did they get out?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You know, I don't recall that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Idon't recall if they got out or were in the tanks.</p></p></dialogue>

I saw the Germans -- you know, I used to sleep on the top bunk. It was three high.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And the top bunk, I could look out the window. You know, what it is was glass, and when I got the window in a certain position, we could see the main road.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right. So they -- because we were on top of a mountain.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's right. It was high up.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right. So we looked in there, and I saw the tanks, the Germans running and Germans jumping off the towers. And it was just like a movie scene of some sort. So this is what I saw through that window. And I was kind of -- you know, because they were shooting into the barracks. So we got to the ground on the floor, and we just waited it out, you know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were there any revenge killings?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. They had, some of the people, I don't know what rank they were, what capacity they were, the Germans, they took them in to where they held the prisoners, the Buchenwald prisoners, you know, that they tortured them there. And they took the Germans, and they gave us two hours for people to go in and beat them up.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: So --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And things took place then, huh?</p><p>This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

How much revenge can you take, you know, so.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah. What did I want to ask you? Now, there is a famous photograph of, I believe it is Eisenhower. I'm not exactly sure. But when he comes and he sees what has happened at Buchenwald, he is so appalled that he orders the townspeople of Weimar to come and be forced to look at --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- what was going on in the camp.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Correct.</p><p>Q. Were you still there when that happened?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. That was in the beginning, you know, because we were there several weeks after.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Can you tell me about that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: About that, I cannot tell you very much. But you know, because first of all, the army kept away the prisoners from these people that they brought in.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, so you saw them at a distance?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We saw them in the distance. We couldn't get so close to them, because of the fact that, you know, revenge would have taken place. And in the U.S., don't take revenge on other people, you know, even, you know, they come into a town, and they don't kill other people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Either they keep them prisoners or whatever.</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. <span class="page-break" number="118"></span> Interview with Jacques Ribons 127</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So in other words, the reason why the prisoners were kept away from the townspeople was because to prevent any kind of violence happening?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, you couldn't help some violence.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because the prison -- the wires were all torn down. You could go out through the wires anywhere you wanted to go. I used to go to the villages and ask for things to eat, you know, in the beginning.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And did they give them to you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. I think they had so much fear in them, that it was beyond belief.</p><p>You know, a guy nearby Buchenwald was a mayor of this particular town. He was made mayor right after the Germans moved away and the Allieds came in, the Allied Forces. I don't know who installed him as mayor, but he was the mayor. I walked into the mayor's house, and I asked him, I would like to have a bike. He says, no problem. He gave me an address, and I went up there and tried to get the bike. And of course, the bikes were all hidden. You couldn't find them. So you know, the idea is that the -- the reason I'm saying that, that the Germans had so much fear of being beaten up or being killed. And in fact, some of them were.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, absolutely. Somehow or another, we got right through the fence. The fence was torn apart, and we just walked out. And we went to the nearby towns. I went a couple of times to Weimar.</p></p></dialogue>

There was a lot of other people. There were a lot of Russian immigrants and all kinds of stuff, all kinds of people that were on that ship. And we came to New York.
