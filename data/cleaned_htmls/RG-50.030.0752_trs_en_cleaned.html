<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, to turn it in. Everybody had to turn in. You couldn't listen to the radio because if you picked up in fact, you could pick up London on most radios.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: To the Czech border. That was the other I don't know how far away it was. It was quite a distance.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And we used to listen to Radio Prague.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In German and Czech mostly.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Ina roundabout way, yes, because the Czech language is a Slavic language. So you could understand some of it.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Before and after.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. But, you know, when the Germans came in, they took all the radios. You know, there was a death penalty, at least they said, if they caught you to have a radio.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I guess what I'm trying to do is get a sense of how much information came into the town. How well informed were people about the larger historical, you know, things that were going on? The political developments that were going on? Were people afraid or did it all seem very distant?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. My father went through World War I when he was a kid.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="17"></span>  Interview with Jacques Ribons 21</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And so he was aware of the things of war. And I heard him speak to his friends about the war. And the consensus among them was it's not going to last very long. Because they were aware there were planes and, you know, kinds of things that they can use to really to doajob on another country. So they were aware of things. And I heard them speak and I was sort of aware what was going on myself.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So there was talk of war, but there was also a confidence that you could beat somebody who invades your country?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: There was no confidence?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: There was never any confidence because within the government</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: the Polish government had some Germans in high office. And so they just they actually dismantled the air force before the war started.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you're saying there was some sort of sabotage from within?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. And since itwas you know, the last place I lived which was Sulmierzyce, they wehadseen you know, it was very close to the German border.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And we were aware but not to the extent that they came in with, which the blasts and the armament and whatnot was going on. So the war was wasn't going to last very long.</p><p>Nobody believed that it's going to last very long. Because the Poles didn't have enough of a force to fight them off.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="18"></span> </p><p> Interview with Jacques Ribons 22</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I see. So it was in that sense that you _ that there was talk that they were coming and they'll overrun us immediately? That sort of talk?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yes. There was no doubt about it. And they did come in, and within a couple days they were all occupied, the whole area.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell me the first time that you do you remember where you were when you learned that the war had broken out?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So there was an as announcement over the radio?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: There was an announcement.

It's been a couple years. So, therefore, he was supposed to report to one of the military I would say where register and they get you into the service.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: One yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So he left. We didn't know where he was when the Germans came in. And my father finally came home. I don't know how many how much time. I cannot remember the time element it took for him to come back. He was _ told the story that he was captured by the Germans and they held him. And they were going to kill him and a whole bunch of people that they were going to kill. So they had _ my father had a gold Omega pocket watch, which in those days was the style. And one of the German guards saw it. He</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="19"></span>  Interview with Jacques Ribons 23 says, "If you give me this, I'll let you go." So he gave him the watch and he really let him go, and he came home.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see. So it was for his breath.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right. Right. That was just the beginning.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And when was the first time you saw any did you see German soldiers soon after that announcement came? When did you first have the war come to you?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. What happened?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The Germans moved in and they started killing people. They rounded up the teachers, the priests, the rabbis, you know, and they started killing them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So this sounds like it was not based on whether you were Jewish or not but based more if you were, like, a community leader. "Cause a priest or a rabbi would be a community leader.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right. The elite. The teachers, the doctors, the old the educated people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. And they were the ones who were being arrested and killed?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right, either killed or sent to Germany to work. I am not aware how many people they killed, but I know they did.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you see anything did you see any violence on the streets?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: From time to time. The occupation was broadcast and we didn't go out on the street until they entrenched themselves within the city, within the town.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you stayed at home. When you found out that the war was on, your mother and your brother and your sister you stayed inside the house?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The German people the German soldiers did not know who was Jewish and who was not.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see. Okay. And what is the first thing that you noticed that was different?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The food. We didn't get much food. It was rationed. And the ruthlessness of the German occupiers. They'd just beat people up, beat kids up, beat grownups up and got them to work or picked them up in the street and took them to work.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So in other words, I get the sense that there's really no fighting that actually happened; that there was no fight that was put up in your area. They just ran in.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: "Cause I never saw when the war started.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, we ate what they gave us, which was very little.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: It was sort of, I think, a death camp. They packed us in in barracks. And, I mean, we were packed. The place was filling up almost. And I didn't think we were going to make it from there. But they took us from there. We were there about a week or two weeks.</p><p>Again, time wasn't --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- important anyhow. And they took us and packed us on open freight trains to Gross- Rosen. Now, come to find out, after the war when I went back with Lisa, that it -- they produced marble in that area. They were digging for marble. And the place was surrounded but you -- the people outside could not look in. No access to it. So nobody knew what was going on in that prison camp.</p><p>They took us. Anyhow, they put us on freight trains.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And anyhow, they gave us a little bit of soup a day and they took us from out, to march us out. Then put us back. We were supposed to go down for a while. And I got so sick that I really begged them to take me away. I had, unfortunately, diarrhea so bad --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Oh, dear.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- I could no longer take it.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="60"></span> Interview with Jacques Ribons 64</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Oh, dear.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So they took me into a -- I'm shaky.

Whether he was Jewish or not, I don't know. Whether he was a doctor, I don't know. So he came, of all the kids, he came up to me and he said, "How old are you?" I said, "Sixteen."

And they had Gls with machine guns guarding all this.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And they bombed the hell out of it. You know, they -- it just choked. They couldn't penetrate. It didn't kill anybody except a piece of cement fell on some person there that killed them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But it meant that you were a hair's breadth away from death so many times, so many times. And it's incredible. It's incredible. I mean, it gets me -- gives me the sense -- I mean, one of the questions that I have is did you ever not have fear? For the entire six years, was there anytime you were not afraid?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No. I was afraid. I was afraid for my life. I'd run into -- one time during an air raid, I went into a shack --</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="103"></span> Interview with Jacques Ribons 107</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- you know, that had a shed on top of it.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And they buried all the -- the whole -- there were about ten people there. And we were all buried. Fortunately enough, another bomb dropped nearby and uncovered us and we found each other right on top of one other.</p></p></dialogue>

Well, as I say, I know that it cost -- I know that it's not easy to remember these things but I also, on behalf of the museum, I'm very appreciative that you've taken the time and that you have shared all of this with me today and through us to be able to share it with those who will research and those who will show interest in what happened to people, in the future.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p>End of File Two Beginning File Three</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Hello. This is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Mr.</p><p>Jacques Ribons on June 10, 2014, taking place between Washington, D.C. and Las Vegas, Nevada. It is a continuation and addition to the interview we conducted with Mr.</p><p>Ribons on May 20, 2014. There were some topics that were omitted from the original interview, and Mr. Ribons would now like to complete that picture. So please, Mr.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="106"></span> </p><p> Interview with Jacques Ribons 110 Ribons, let me know what it is that you wanted to add to what you originally talked to us about.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Iam not sure that I gave the interview on the subject of a march from Blechhammer to Gross-Rosen.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Let's talk about it in detail, even if it might be in the original interview. Tell me about that march and as much as you remember. And what about it is significant in your mind?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, the Russian Army came close, took over just about all of Poland.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And you can hear the rifle shots, and the Germans took out the whole tent, with the exception of some very sick people that were left there. And we start walking. We didn't know where we were going or nothing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So which camp was this?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: This was Blechhammer.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Blechhammer. Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So from Blechhammer we walked. And every second night or every night, if I remember right, they took us to a farm. And we slept outside in the barns, where they had the cows and the pigs, and you know, the prisoners went there to sleep.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And so what time of year was this?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: What time of year?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. Was it winter?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: January.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="107"></span> </p><p> Interview with Jacques Ribons 111</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So it was cold?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. I think it was the month of January.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. So was there snow on the ground?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was it difficult to walk?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was difficult to walk. Mainly, we walk on the main streets, where the German Army started retreating. We walked alongside the ravine, so to speak, you know, alongside that main street. And there were guns, but the Russians machine gun the area where the Germans were walking. And occasionally, they hit us as we were walking.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can | interrupt just for a second?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Sure.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When they machine gun, does that mean they were flying overhead and doing this?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The Russian Air Force was flying overhead and had machine guns, primarily, aimed at the Germans. So they had German guards with machine guns watching us. So they kind of machine gunned along the line of the prisoners.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Isee. So they must have been flying pretty low, and it was nevertheless dangerous because you were walking right next to them --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- on the side of the road?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Correct. So occasionally, they killed some prisoners. I don't think they could have helped it. They were aiming at the guards, primarily, and they carried guns, machine guns and rifles and so on to watch the prisoners. And we walked. Probably every night</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="108"></span> </p><p> Interview with Jacques Ribons 112 we stopped. We slept outside in the snow. And on a Sunday, we wound up in a barn with the cows and pigs.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How were you dressed?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In-- very skimpy, in the prisoners" uniforms that we wore. Myself, personally, I had a -- I happened to have a sweater somehow. I don't remember how I got it. And I wore that sweater. And I also wore bags, you know, the empty bags of cement as protection to keep warm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you would wear that under the uniform?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yes. Oh, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And what kind of footwear did you have?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Myself, I had a pair of boots somehow I got, and there were no soles on them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, my.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So you know, they were very skimpy. It was actually -- you know, we got all wet.</p><p>My feet got all wet. And well, I didn't have any shoes. So I wrapped, you know, some of the stuff, my feet in cloth, that I could find or whatever I could get, you know, so my feet wouldn't freeze.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So when you were walking along the side of the road, and it was January, and there was the machine gunning from the Soviets, and the Germans as well, were there snow drifts? Was it loud? Was it icy?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. We actually walked not on the outside of the road, because it was impossible to walk, but we walked on the main road to the side.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Isee.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="109"></span>  Interview with Jacques Ribons 113</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And you know, on one side of the street. And as we were walking, the Russians, I don't know if willingly or not, the machine gun, primarily, they tried to machine gun the guards.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And of course, the guards moved in among the prisoners. So you know, I guess they must have hit some prisoners.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Isee. So the guards would realize this, and then they would intermingle with the prisoners?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: With the prisoners, correct.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Isee. And by that point, were there a lot of German guards, or was it few and far between?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, it was a lot of guards. Again, they carried machine guns. However, you know, the roads were full of people going west, because the Russians were right behind us. So we could hear rifle shots from time to time. So they were very, very close behind us.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you were about to talk about one Sunday you ended up someplace.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: One Sunday, we ended up in a barn. I don't know where that was. And they gave us coffee. And they were shooting, practicing, I guess, either that or shooting at the legs of the prisoners. So of course, they fell, and us, we left them there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Who was doing the shooting?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The Germans.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The Germans were shooting at the legs of the prisoners?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Right.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="110"></span> ontectrefieanneaushariarg tr hither btrmedortabeattfiealiaton</p><p> Interview with Jacques Ribons 114</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: As you were drinking coffee?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, we were getting coffee from that big -- what do you call it -- pot, and they were giving the prisoners coffee. Well, the prisoners did, but the Germans are the ones that allowed that to happen, the coffee pot.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And as we got the coffee, they were shooting at the legs of the prisoners.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, my.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So when that happened, of course, they fell. They couldn't stand up.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Ofcourse.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And we had to leave them behind. And I am sure -- I personally didn't see it, but I'm sure they killed them after they left.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. Yeah. Did people die as they were marching?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yes, many, many people. They were actually froze to death. We had to sleep in the snow. Occasionally, on a Sunday -- we walked about three Sundays, and I was able, with my brother and some other kids, get into a barn with the cows and the pigs, you know, and keep warm, you know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you were walking for at least three Sundays?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Ibelieve it was three Sundays.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So that would mean at least two weeks, maybe more?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Three weeks.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Three weeks?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: About two to three weeks. And again, I don't know how many prisoners died during</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="111"></span> ontectnetonancedjusietneey for ther biormatierabouttfisstecion</p><p> Interview with Jacques Ribons 115 that march.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Imean, it must have been an enormous amount of prisoners that passed on. I try to -- I'm sorry.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No, I was going to say, it's the kind of stamina you would need in order to survive that would be very high, and some people just couldn't hold out.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's correct. We fought for our lives, literally.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And Iwas fortunate. I was able to make it. I tried to help a man that I knew in prison. He was from France. And his name was Ribak.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Ribak?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: R-I-B-A-C or B-A-K. I don't know how he spelled it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: R-I-C --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, no. R -- Ribak.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, R-I-B-A-C-K?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: R-I-B, yes. And I helped him as much as I could, and then I finally gave up. I couldn't do it any longer, and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: In what way were you trying to help him; by helping him walk?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: By helping him walk. Yes, by helping him walk. I mean, I knew him in prison. We occasionally worked side by side, you know, so.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did anybody try to escape?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Probably. I didn't have the stamina. I wouldn't know where to go.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="112"></span> </p><p> Interview with Jacques Ribons 116</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We were in Germany at the time, so.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were there civilians on the road, too? I'm sorry I interrupted.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yes, there were civilians. There were people with push carts and their belongings. There were all kinds of people that walked, because they were trying to avoid the Russians, you know, particularly if they were Germans, you know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It sounds like chaos.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, it was, absolutely. And we had Russian prisoners, and you know, all kinds of prisoners walked alongside of us. The road wasn't big enough for all of these people that walked, including the German Army.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell me this, how many lanes did it have, or at least the main roads you were on?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>Were they single lanes, one in each direction, or were they wider than that?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Ibelieve they were wider than that. I'm not sure, you know. Again, we were fighting for our lives. We didn't pay attention too much of what was going on around us, except, you know, we tried to hide from the bullets.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You know, and we didn't know they were Russian planes until they came down real low.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: So it was chaos, absolutely chaos.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="113"></span>  Interview with Jacques Ribons 117</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And it was a 250-mile stretch. And I took my daughter and my son and my grandson on that stretch from Blechhammer to Gross-Rosen in a van.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, my gosh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Just recently about a year ago.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So that would be like in 2013?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you redid the whole death march walk?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The whole trip, yes, the whole trip. From my hometown where I was born to the trip, all the way to Gross-Rosen and from Gross-Rosen to Buchenwald.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So tell me, the 250 miles, does that go from your hometown to Buchenwald, or does that go just from Blechhammer?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: From Blechhammer to Gross-Rosen was about a 250-mile stretch. At least, I didn't know. My daughter told me that it was that distance.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Ofcourse. I mean, at that time, how would you know. It took you three weeks or so at that time. How long did it take by van when you went?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: By van, I don't know, about eight hours, ten hours. I'm not sure. I didn't even think of paying attention to that, you know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I drove with my daughter, my grandson and my son.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did any of it look familiar to you, the road, when you went on it again?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no, no. It was totally changed, because they -- first of all, you know, with so  <span class="page-break" number="114"></span> ontectnetonancedjusietneey for ther biormatierabouttfisstecion</p><p> Interview with Jacques Ribons 118 much chaos, you didn't even pay attention to anything, except, you know, you try to survive. You know, the food was very scarce. I was in one of the areas where you ate in one of the farms that we walked in. I saw a house, people, that the farmer, I guess, lived in. And I run to the farmer, knocked on their door asking for food, for bread. And the commander, so to speak, the person in charge of the prisoners, he said, What are you doing here, in German. And I said, I would like to have something to eat. So that young woman -- it was a young woman. He said, he says, you can give him bread, provided that you sleep with me tonight.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So she says okay. And she gave me a loaf of bread. And when I went out, I got hit over my back with a cane. And I went to my brother, and I gave him half of the bread.</p><p>We ate that just one night, you know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, my gosh. What a horrible -- what a horrible situation and how cruel, how absolutely cruel.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It's much crueler than anybody can even anticipate.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, yeah. What human beings will do in order to kill the humanity in others.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I would imagine, you know, it happens all over, even today.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So the cruelest animal on earth is the human being.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Unfortunately. Unfortunately.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So anyhow, then we got to Gross-Rosen. We were there for several days. We were packed like sardines. And we had just a bowl of soup during the day. And I don't</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="115"></span> </p><p> Interview with Jacques Ribons 119 remember whether we got bread or not. We were there for almost about a week. And that was Gross-Rosen. And Gross-Rosen was very secluded, because they had -- they were mining marble in that area. So the people on the outside couldn't see what was going on there in that -- in Gross-Rosen. And you know, after five days or so, a week maybe, maybe longer, they loaded up -- they loaded us up on the freight trains. They were going and taking the marble to market, I guess. And they loaded up the prisoners on these open freight trains, and they took us. We didn't know where we were going, and with guards on them. Each car had two guards with machine guns or regular guns. I'm not sure what. At that time, I wasn't really familiar with the weapons.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. Just that they can kill.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right. So they -- when they loaded us up, we were on the way. And we got all the way to Weimar where we were bombed. I think the allied's air force made a mistake and didn't know who it was, because they did see guards watching these things, you know, and they bombed the train. A lot of Germans, the guards, including the prisoners, were killed, a lot of them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. And this was allied bombing?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: This was allied bombing. I don't know what air force that was there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But primarily, I think the U.S. Air Force was in that area, or the U.S. Army was in that area, you know, so.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did you ever make it then to Buchenwald --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="116"></span>  Interview with Jacques Ribons 120</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- or just to Weimar?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, we made it into Buchenwald. They took us to Buchenwald, and I --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Excuse me. Can I interrupt you for a minute.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Sure.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did the train go until Weimar, the Town of Weimar, or did it go up to the camp at Buchenwald?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: To my knowledge, the railroad into Buchenwald, the railroad tracks, to my knowledge, if I remember right, were bombed out. So they took us by truck.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Isee. I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Into Buchenwald. It was not all that far.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No, no. It isn't that far.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So in fact, we used to walk it after the war. Because Buchenwald is in the mountains, and this is below the mountain. So from there, we were there, I don't know, from January until April.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you were in Buchenwald for all that time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yes, and we were in what is called a children's barracks. It had three -- I think they had three or four barracks where they kept just children. And I guess, there was a whole story behind it, because the -- also Germans, since the 1930s, were -- they were prisoners.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes. In Buchenwald, it had had a lot of German political prisoners.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right. So they sort of protected, to my knowledge, the kids. And at the time that they tried to take the kids out, we went to this appellplatz, and you know, we all lined up.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="117"></span>  Interview with Jacques Ribons 121 And then they took us back to the barracks. What happened in the interim, I don't know.</p><p>I guess they had -- they had, within the prison, you know, people that carried guns. In fact, outside of Buchenwald, there was an ammunition factory.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Now, I'ma little confused at this point. When you were in Buchenwald from January to April, --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- who was in control?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, the Germans were in control. However, there also, since the factory where most of the German prisoners worked, and the other prisoners, I don't know which one of the prisoners they kept work in the ammunition factory, they smuggled in a lot of arms, the Germans.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And to my knowledge, they had Germans with guns roaming the prison. So I guess, the Germans feared a lot that the prisoners, whether it was the Germans or Russian prisoners, I don't know, but I know there were Germans.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay. But when you are saying Germans, are you talking about German political prisoners or --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: German political prisoners that smuggled in arms.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, I see what you are saying. They were working in the ammunitions factory.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Inthe ammunitions factory.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: They were smuggling in some arms that were kept secret from the authorities?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Absolutely, yes.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="118"></span>  Interview with Jacques Ribons 122</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And yet, they would patrol the place with those arms; is that correct?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not patrol, but they watched. As soon as the Germans left, they took over.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Isee. As soon as the regular Nazi, you know, they left, then these political prisoners</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes, these political prisoners came out and tried to help -- they were not just Germans. They were all kinds of prisoners. There were Swedes, and they had Danes. I don't know where -- the Danes I can understand, but I don't understand the Swedes, how they got there.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, because they are supposed to be neutral.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right. I don't know how they got there, but they had them there. So and the reason I know that to be a fact is because I was hospitalized. I had extreme diarrhea that they -- I begged them to take me away already. I couldn't take it anymore.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Iremember that part in our conversation before, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Right. So --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And what was -- what did you do and your brother when you were there? Were you also put to work or --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- or not?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. In Buchenwald, we didn't work.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Isee.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: At least the time, the period of time that I was there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Isee. Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="119"></span> </p><p> Interview with Jacques Ribons 123</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You know, there were deaths all over. People cut out the innards of the dead and ate, you know. This is the kind of stuff that I saw. It was a matter of either dying or doing that, so.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What about, when you say that the Nazi authorities left and the political prisoners took over, could you say that they liberated -- the German political prisoners liberated the camp, or was it another army that did it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no. I think it was -- I can't think of the general's name that came in. Let me kind of put a little emphasis on the whole situation, the whole picture there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They had a -- if I can remember the town -- Erfurt.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Erfurt, yes, is near there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was in the mountains, across the mountains. You could see from Buchenwald all the way into the mountains of Erfurt. They had a battle going on in Erfurt. At night, we used to see the cannons going off, the artillery going off at night from Erfurt, because it lit up. So the general who was the tank commander, and I can't remember his name. My memory is not like it used to be.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's easy to find out though. We can look it up, you know, who that would have been.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, he got killed in Germany in a car crash or something. I'm not sure how he died, the general.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: He was in charge of the tank unit that came into Buchenwald.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="120"></span> </p><p> Interview with Jacques Ribons 124</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And did you see then American soldiers?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. There was just a tank came in with a couple -- they opened the turret, and they peaked out. And the Germans were already gone. They jumped off the guard towers, and the prisoners were chasing them. You know, so they caught some. You know, it was all chaos, you know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They killed some, you know, and they brought some back to prison. So they -- the Germans were gone.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The army came in and -- the American Army came in, and of course, they start giving us food, you know, rations and stuff like that. And then organizations came in from western Europe that fed us after a while. So but as a whole, Erfurt, they were there for about a week or maybe more. They were shooting at the Germans across the mountains, and you could see it. At night, you could see it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So when they finally came into the -- into Buchenwald itself, the tank and with the solders, --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: The tank, yeah, with the people in it, opened the turret and looked out.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And did they get out?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You know, I don't recall that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Idon't recall if they got out or were in the tanks.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Where were you when you saw this?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="121"></span>  Interview with Jacques Ribons 125</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We kind of roamed around, because there was nobody there to keep us anywhere, you know, because the Germans were already gone. I saw the Germans -- you know, I used to sleep on the top bunk. It was three high.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And the top bunk, I could look out the window. You know, what it is was glass, and when I got the window in a certain position, we could see the main road.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right. So they -- because we were on top of a mountain.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's right. It was high up.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right. So we looked in there, and I saw the tanks, the Germans running and Germans jumping off the towers. And it was just like a movie scene of some sort. So this is what I saw through that window. And I was kind of -- you know, because they were shooting into the barracks. So we got to the ground on the floor, and we just waited it out, you know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were there any revenge killings?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. They had, some of the people, I don't know what rank they were, what capacity they were, the Germans, they took them in to where they held the prisoners, the Buchenwald prisoners, you know, that they tortured them there. And they took the Germans, and they gave us two hours for people to go in and beat them up.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: So --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And things took place then, huh?</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="122"></span> </p><p> Interview with Jacques Ribons 126</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, you know, you punch the guy. How much revenge can you take, you know, so.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah. What did I want to ask you? Now, there is a famous photograph of, I believe it is Eisenhower. I'm not exactly sure. But when he comes and he sees what has happened at Buchenwald, he is so appalled that he orders the townspeople of Weimar to come and be forced to look at --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- what was going on in the camp.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Correct.</p><p>Q. Were you still there when that happened?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. That was in the beginning, you know, because we were there several weeks after.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Can you tell me about that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: About that, I cannot tell you very much. But you know, because first of all, the army kept away the prisoners from these people that they brought in.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, so you saw them at a distance?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We saw them in the distance. We couldn't get so close to them, because of the fact that, you know, revenge would have taken place. And in the U.S., don't take revenge on other people, you know, even, you know, they come into a town, and they don't kill other people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Either they keep them prisoners or whatever.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="123"></span> Interview with Jacques Ribons 127</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So in other words, the reason why the prisoners were kept away from the townspeople was because to prevent any kind of violence happening?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, you couldn't help some violence.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because the prison -- the wires were all torn down. You could go out through the wires anywhere you wanted to go. I used to go to the villages and ask for things to eat, you know, in the beginning.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And did they give them to you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. I think they had so much fear in them, that it was beyond belief.</p><p>You know, a guy nearby Buchenwald was a mayor of this particular town. He was made mayor right after the Germans moved away and the Allieds came in, the Allied Forces. I don't know who installed him as mayor, but he was the mayor. I walked into the mayor's house, and I asked him, I would like to have a bike. He says, no problem. He gave me an address, and I went up there and tried to get the bike. And of course, the bikes were all hidden. You couldn't find them. So you know, the idea is that the -- the reason I'm saying that, that the Germans had so much fear of being beaten up or being killed. And in fact, some of them were.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: By the Russian prisoners, you know, the ones that were older, not the youngsters, you know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Finish the story about the bike. Did you finally get a bike?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No. They didn't have it. It was all empty.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="124"></span>  Interview with Jacques Ribons 128</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: All the barns were empty. Everything was empty. You know, so | didn't get a bike.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So but it means that by the time that the Americans got -- they were entrenched there, you were able to move out of the camp?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, absolutely. Somehow or another, we got right through the fence. The fence was torn apart, and we just walked out. And we went to the nearby towns. I went a couple of times to Weimar.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was it like? Did you still wear your prisoner's uniform?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We didn't have anything else, really. Just a prisoner's uniform.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did people behave?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Fear.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Some of them were beaten up by others, by the prisoners. So, you know, I was a kid incapable of doing anything, too weak.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But you saw it in their eyes?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh, yes. I saw it, saw them being beaten up, and they were beaten up when they brought the Germans in. I don't know whether it was soldiers or civilians that were brought in, and kept them where they used to torture the prisoners. They kept them there.</p><p>And they used to let them in at, let's say, 3:00 in the afternoon for a half hour to beat the hell out of them, you know. But you know.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="125"></span>  Interview with Jacques Ribons 129</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But were these civilians that were brought in there? A. Yes, civilians. I don't know what capacity, or if they were soldiers, they also were, you know, in probably civilian uniforms. I have no idea.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But what I'm trying to get at is, they weren't former guards that you could recognize?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. The reason they were brought in is because they happened to be German, not because they happened to have been a particularly cruel guard?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They had some too.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, yeah. I'm sure.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But they watched how much beating they could get, you know. They wouldn't allow, even though that person had seen about 19 Germans being shot, you know, soldiers.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And I couldn't tell you who shot them. I know they wore military uniforms, but whether there were civilians in the uniforms or American or any other nationality that shot him, you know, so.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And how old were you at this point?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Iwas born in 1927. This was "45.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You were 18 years old when you were seeing this?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. You know, we were used to seeing all kinds of stuff.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Ihave seen dogs chasing the prisoners and eat them up alive, you know, kill them  <span class="page-break" number="126"></span> </p><p> Interview with Jacques Ribons 130 and eat them. You know, it was not something -- or people being hung, for whatever reason that they found, you know.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It wasn't really that long. There was a -- you know, I didn't know, because I didn't -- there was a rabbi, I suppose. He was an American chaplain that worked on taking the kids out of Buchenwald. And I guess, each government, to my knowledge, I found out later, let in so many kids. And some kids, I understand, went to Cuba. Some kids went to England. Some went to Switzerland, and they went to France, they went to Belgium.</p><p>It depended on the government how many kids they would allow in, into the country.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: By horse and buggy?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They wouldn't spend money for gas to take the Jews across a couple of towns down.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So how long we traveled on that, you know, with the horse and buggy, I don't know.</p><p> I can't really remember.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The march was very important because a lot of people died. I don't know how many.</p><p>Hundreds and hundreds of people died.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: From Weimar going to Gross-Rosen.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because they'd shoot them. They'd shoot them in the legs. And when they did that, they couldn't walk. And when we left, they shot them.</p></p></dialogue>
