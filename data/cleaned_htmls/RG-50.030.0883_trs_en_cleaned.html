<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: At the most, okay. Was it a well-integrated community?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It must have been at one time, but of course, as time came on, it -- it changed.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Did -- did your mother help out in the butcher shop, or no?</p></p></dialogue>

And they took us all over, showing us places. At one point they asked whether I wanted to go back to Rohrbach, and I said no. Until just the day before we were to come back to the States. It was too late. But, at a later time, maybe a year or so later, my younger daughter and her husband visited the elder daughter <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> ontactrefieannedjustanmiang er hither btemelortabnattfiexaliaton Interview with Henry Stern " June 8, 2016 and her husband. And I described the house that we had lived in, and they decided to go.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And look for it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And they found it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did they?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And they told the story of how they walked around looking at the building from different angles, taking pictures. And a woman who -- came out, and wanted to know what they were doing there. And she explained that this the house their father and family had lived in. And she said, I often wondered what happened to those boys. My folks told us about it. She invited them into the house and served them tea, coffee, refreshments, and they looked throughout the house. The house itself was very unusual, because my father had it built.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And it was the first house in the village that had running water, and a running toilet.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, you know, that's what -- you anticipated some of the questions that I have.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Because I always ask people, what kind of modern conveniences did you have in your -- <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion Interview with Henry Stern " June 8, 2016</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: It was -- it was the first building, or first house in Rohrbach that had a pull chain for the toilet, and the villagers would come in to experience this phenomenon.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You have a museum piece there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I been trying to find that house on the internet, I've not been successful. But I understand that the synagogue has changed hands several times. And I think at one time it was a bakery, and a grocery. I have no idea what it is now.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So the building remained, but it no longer was a place of worship.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. What is the address of the house that your father built?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's what I've been trying to determine. As close as I can come to it, it's at the corner of Herm(ph) gassen and Bunder(ph) gassen.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So Herm(ph) gassen and Bunder(ph) gassen.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That I don't know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You don't know. In your mind's eye, can you paint a picture for me of what did the house look like? Was it two story, one story?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Td say, I think three story.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay. <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion Interview with Henry Stern " June 8, 2016</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: It was a very big house, on a very large lot. There was a side yard, there was a backyard, which was a garden. And --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was it stone?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, brick building, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And the family had a farm -- let's say a garden, full of planted vegetables and such.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When you say you had running water, does that also mean you had a bathroom with a bathtub in it?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And how did you heat the home?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't recall.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What -- do you think it might have been coal?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: It could have been. <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Henry Stern 8 June 8, 2016</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Would you have coal ovens?

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think I'm prejudiced. I really don't know whether the -- probably -- it was probably the most modern house, at the time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Does that mean that your father was well-to-do?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I wouldn't say that he was rich by any means, but the family was confortable.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Did you have an automobile?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no. That's interesting. The first automobile that I saw, was when a cousin, who had just gotten married, she and her husband drove into the village on their honeymoon. And I remember vaguely, a night trip we took to visit an au -- an au -- aunt in, oh, in bent -- Bensheim.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Bensheim, mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. And I don't even know where Bensheim is in Germany.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- in the village.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Very unusual.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. So what was the mode of transportation for most people, aside from their feet?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Was there a railway station?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Not that I know of, no, but the --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And was the travel between towns in, let's say, to Frankfurt, which is a large city, were there buses?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No. In fact, one of the things I read is that if youngsters wanted to go beyond an eighth grade, which was the only education in Rohrbach, a one school -- one room schoolhouse -- but if they wanted to go beyond eighth grade, they had to go to Bietingen, and the only way they could go is to walk, bicycle, horseback --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I see.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- ora cart.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- to -- to Bietingen.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. Was it an agricultural community, in general?</p></p></dialogue>

His main job is to buy cattle for the butcher shop, and he would have to go from village to village, and to market to market to buy the cattle.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, a horse and cart.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes. Apparently they came over as young men. Don't ask me when, but they were young. Eventually William moved to Newport News, Virginia. Saul stayed out west, in Texas, and he opened several businesses, but he ended up in Borger, Texas, running a clothing store. <span class="page-break" number="15"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Henry Stern " June 8, 2016</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They really didn't tell us about the family, and what we have been able to gather is memories from different members of the family. And it's all hearsay, actually.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I understand. Sometimes that hearsay is unbelievably accurate, and sometimes it's not, but you need more verification to determine whether it is, you know. And that's sometimes not so easy to come by.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right. And that's one reason I've been going on the internet, getting information.</p><p>In fact, I utilized the local Mormon church to get on the internet.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. So this sounds like entirely a private enterprise. Nothing that would have involved a community agency, a Jewish agency, a government agency.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not that I know of. Remember, in order to bring immigrants into the country, the sponsor had to sign a paper, they would be responsible.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The government didn't want -- couldn't do anything, th -- the government at the time, was handicapped. We were in a depression.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's true.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And in addition to that, you had the American firsters -- isolationists. They didn't want to get involved with other people. And of course -- and before Father Coughlin, and so on, they were quite influential, at the time. So, what could the government do? The politicians were scared, they wanted to stay in power. As we have right now.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And when they filled that quota, they persuaded other people to sponsor immigrants.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, this i-- this is not inconsequential, you know. Can you tell me a little bit about your memories of who -- what they were like, what were their personalities?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>Like I asked about your father and your mother, what can you tell me about them?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, Roselyn(ph) was a beautiful lady. She was outgoing, and just friendly with everybody. Bill was a doer. He served many terms as president of the congregation, Rodef Sholom.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was he particularly well-off?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, far from it.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Wow.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We were coming out of the depression at the time. How many pieces of china and gifts were -- were being bought at the time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Not many, cause that's not a necessity. <span class="page-break" number="36"></span> ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion Interview with Henry Stern "" June 8, 2016</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: That's right.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: That despite that -- did he talk about his own family in Germany, did he talk about Germany, did he talk about getting people out, did he --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, not -- not to me, no, not that I'm aware of.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We were the first that they brought over.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. And so, how did your father get on his feet financially, and your mother?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My father took a job, the only job he could get, I assume, in a warehouse, at five dollars a week. My mother would bake cakes, that she would sell on order, from people in the community. In addition to that, she became the janitor of Rodef Sholom temple. And many is the time, after a rain, she had to go down to the temple and bail water out of the basement.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's not easy.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did they find it hard to adjust here?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: My father did, yeah. My mother, not too much. But eventually -- <span class="page-break" number="37"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Henry Stern " June 8, 2016</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: What was -- excuse me for interrupting, but what was hard for him, in the adjustment?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He was used to the German way, what he had been doing.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Had they -- had he had higher education, your father?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It was unusual.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: But I would say within a year or so, he opened up a grocery, again on 26" Street, just a half a block up from where we were living. And if I remember correctly, the store was opened after sundown on s -- on Saturday, first day. And Bill Morgenstern came to the house afterwards, and said, how did -- asked how he did, and the answer was, we took in eight dollars. And Bill said, that's great.

He and I would take stuff, and run up and down the stairs, hawking [indecipherable] a penny. And we used to sell extras, those days there were a lot of extras. Saturday nights, after football games, the papers would put out an extra with the scores. And somehow my brother found what was called, Peninsula News Company.

And Walter became editor of the school paper.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>He won a prize, I forget whether it was the American Legion, or the VFW, city- wide contest, essay contest. And he graduated with honors from high school.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. They had a chance to leave Germany, but they refused, because the grandmother had diabetes, and she could not enter the United States. So they stayed, to take care of her.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. Just three, four miles from Newport News, down the road, on route 60. He didn't like it, so he and his wife and daughter Edith, they moved to -- I think it was Brooklyn.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And he got a job in a silversmith company, I can't think, it was Gorham(ph), or somebody up here.

There was my father's brother Joseph, and his wife Tilly(ph), and Joe -- Joseph, who I remember, whenever you met him, as a kid, he always reached in his pocket and brought out a piece of candy he offered you. He opened up a small hardware business in Newport News.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: A decent size community. At that time, the shipbuilding industry, th -- because of the war, brought in a lot of people. And, of course, the army and the air f-- corps -- we're near by Langley Field, Fort Eustis, which we know is Fort Useless.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Probably others as well, because while I'm familiar with the family members that were brought over, he had gotten other people to sponsor other immigrants, and I'm not familiar who they would have been.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Why?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because the influences of Henry Ford, Father Coughlin, and so on, were also felt in Newport News, and didn't want to bring anything to bear on the Jewish fa -- congregation.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Pll mention a couple of things. I played football. At one assembly in high school, the coach was passing out the letters and so on, and I remember him saying, I knew we would have a winning season, because I have a Jew on the team.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Mm-hm. And yet, probably at the time, the most successful basketball coach in Virginia was Julie Kahn(ph).

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Still.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Ican recall back in Fairmont, I was conducting a campaign -- I think it was for Israel bonds. It was either Israel bonds, or JNF.

He said no, I won't do it. Well, I was president of B'nai Brith at the time, and he asked me to do it. So I said, okay. And we set up a dinner meeting in a hotel.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: This is West Virginia, mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And, in addition to the Jewish people, I invited the presidents of the local banks, cause we were trying to sell -- it was bonds, now that I remember putting it together, we were approaching the banks to buy bonds.

We had put up one night, I forget where, in a -- I guess you would call it, almost a bed and breakfast type of affair, an apartment building. And I had con -- talked to the man about paying the next day with my credit card, and he said, fine.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, please do.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Directly across the street from our house in Rohrbach, was the synagogue.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: From the information I've gotten on the internet, there were three tourists, they disappeared. The building was sold at auction for around 500 marks -- 560 marks, I think it said.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was a forced sale, and there are no records of that money ever having been paid. I thought that was interesting.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It is interesting. It is interesting. So this was clearly in the 1930s.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: This was in 39 -- "38, deg39. <span class="page-break" number="58"></span> ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion Interview with Henry Stern * June 8, 2016</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And you have not found any re -- any document talking of any restitution to anyone, for that building?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The Jews had disappeared. And apparently they made no effort to try to locate any that may have emigrated.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Who would be the rightful owner? Which legal body would be the rightful owner of that synagogue?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, depending on -- I see there you're getting to a legal matter -- depending on the validity of the auction sale, who -- who bought it -- there's no record of who the buyer was. As far as any Jews -- well, the Jewish congregation --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah, that's what I mean -- I meant.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- family, who's left? I'm the only one from my family left.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: From all of these people who were brought over, you're the last one?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>

They re -- they weren't born then. But they have -- the community has a history, their parents or grandparents, they share in a responsibility for what happened. They can say if they want to, that they didn't know, but God, who do they think they're kidding? They had to know. Just as the Poles say they didn't know that we had concentration camps around the corner. They had to know.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, they were in them, too. There were millions of Poles in those concentration camps as well.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did Mr. Morgenstern -- how was her -- his final years? Do you know? Did he continue working, and retire from his china shop? Do you know what happened to him?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I remember that from the 61" Street house, they bought another house, overlooking the James river, which was just a mile or so away. Was a nice, small house, well taken care of. And he used to sit out on his back lawn, looking at the sunset, as it disappeared -- the sun disappeared over the James river bridge, and so on. He died, I think, in "56, or "57. He had retired. His son Jules had taken over the business.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did the kids know of all of his activities, and what he had done? <span class="page-break" number="60"></span> ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion Interview with Henry Stern "4 June 8, 2016</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I think so. Ernestine certainly knew quite a bit about it.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Are they both a-alive still, the children?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Ernestine is alive. In fact, we're going to see her next week.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Ah, okay. Okay. Is there anything else you'd like to add to our interview today?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [really can't think of anything else, no.</p></p></dialogue>
