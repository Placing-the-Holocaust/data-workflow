<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can you describe the setting of your childhood?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was born in the countryside, the real countryside in a small island and my father was my teacher. It was a certain circle where the people thought the state should mix in as little as possible. The state should have nothing to do with religion, therefore they had their own church, built their own church and had their own priest. Also, they made their own school, and my father was chosen as the teacher. We were not allowed say , as people usually do. It was two fine words. About 75 children went to my father and only nine children when to the official school.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Your father was a teacher?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. He started being a teacher of the first high school. That's different from a high school. The first high school were usually young people come to learn. But when they had no school at this free school, they asked my father to take it over and he did.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How many children were there in your family?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Twelve. My father's first wife died when she had borne three children. And my mother had nine children, and when we were 12 years old we had to go out to work, to work for the farmers. That meant in a way, even if my father would protest, that our childhood was taken from us. To go in the fields and here other children of our age were playing. That was awful.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Why did you have to go to work at 12?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because we were poor. My mother said sometimes to my father who was educated and a school teacher, that he should leave this free school and he could earn double. But he was an idealist.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What were the strong ideals that he believed in beyond the state not intervening.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was only that people should choose their own priest, choose their own teacher. That was a personal question. That is called in Denmark after the <span class="page-break" number="0"></span> thought of being a priest, but I would like to study. That was impossible when I worked on the farms. But then I worked for a community making ditches and they would stop when it suited me and go to the only person in the village who could teach me foreign languages. That was the doctor. There I learned English and German so much that I could start in the gymnasium in . That was the nearest place at that time. They laughed at little old me and said that my pronunciation was rather different than what they used there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you went to gymnasium at what age?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Eighteen. I was 22, I could not get into the gymnasium. We had to take something called</p><p> before that. So, I went four years to school and then I went to</p><p> to study, and what interested me is what I would call the history and</p><p> ideology something like that. I wanted to study literature. What interested me was the ideology in different times. The development of the human spirit.</p><p>So, I started with something called comparing literature. Comparing all the different cantors literature. Then I was in love with a young lady and all told me that this would not give me an earning. Only if you should be a professor and that would be two places in Denmark. So, I started to study as other people two literatures and that was German and Danish. And I finished that. My first book was comparison between and</p><p> who are completely different ideas but who psychologically are very alike. They don't like the people as they are. , you would say that it <span class="page-break" number="1"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Had you been to Germany before this?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When was your first trip to Germany?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, my when I went to school on the vacations I always went -- rode on my bicycle. My first trip was around England and then I went on bicycle to Rome and on bicycle to Paris, and I had to go through Germany and I slept in . There I have memories in Berlin when I wrote my name Jakobsen some guy said Jackobsen and I found that I would fail in my duty to the Jews if I told them I am no Jew. In Denmark there were many Jakobsen who were not Jewish so I let them believe I was a Jew instead of that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did they treat you badly?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They were about to throw me out, the leader of that thought he could not throw me out into the street in the middle of the night.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When did you begin these vacation travels to England and to Rome and to Germany?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>What years are we talking about?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I work from when I was 12 until I was 18 and I was born in "06, so it must have been in "25. And in "25 there was still so much unrest and little bureaucracy in Germany so I was told that it would be too dangerous to go to Germany and therefore I went to England the next time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you only spend vacations in Germany or did you ever study in Germany?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I had not studied in Germany, only vacation. But I studied German and if I choose between taking English and Danish and German and Danish I preferred the Danish literature. People like . <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> if there was not a revolution in Germany or in other more progressive states then the revolution in Russia would fade. Also, according to Marxism the revolution should come in the most industrial states and areas, not in a state like Russia. And it failed in Russia.</p><p>Different from what people believe I could see this plan had not led to anything. That Russia is much backwards.</p><p> Q. Did you meet Trotsky? Did Trotsky come to Denmark?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We had a great meeting made by the social democratic students of Trotsky, and I heard him there. He spoke German and his German was not as good as I believed. The day afterwards I went to see him and there I was forced away by his . <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> privately. But they were very cautious of course.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When did you meet your wife?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My wife came here as . I think you know what it means, but I think I have to explain it. The British had Israel as and they would not allow Jews to go to Israel if they had not learned something agricultural. The Jews are not very agricultural but she chose to learn poultry farming. She went to Sweden to learn poultry farming. And one day when one of my Jewish friends from Hamberg proposed that we should make a trip to Sweden and meet one of his Jewish friends in Hamberg who was working poultry farming there. And so we met. I like to come to Denmark and that could only happen if we also married. Also the Danish government did not want to take all the Jews from Germany to Denmark, but when we married there was no problem.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was her name?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: . The family is still in Germany and they change the name <span class="page-break" number="4"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Her family did?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. Only one brother was left and that was because he had been a German soldier. He could stay there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Let me ask you about your deep interest in German literature and German ideas.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It is not deep interest in German literature and German ideas, it is a deep interest in literature and ideas. But it is correct in that way that once I had to decide where I would choose English and Danish as my fields at the university or German and Danish and I chose German, and that was because I preferred to Dickensian.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Why did you prefer and 2</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because I thought that ideologies, how the people have thought so different movements. There was much more of this sort in German. It is quoted</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When you talk about movements can you describe a little more what you mean?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, the first through the office catholic church, catholic means they said no church.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can you describe a little more about the ideas of - and that so much interested you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: is not so much his own ideas as his formulations and they met in Paris but is a great poet in that way that he can formulate things and Shuller's ideas that is old ideas about thought, the unreal things, the immaterial things, the unreal things that are very far from people today.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did Shillar thought affect your moral judgments?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I think I would be moral before I knew Shillar. I like Shillar it his pathos.</p><p> , that is Shillar and that is the same as the Christian that if <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> lost. I think where people knew German, I know this fairly well because I was a delegate to the Council in Europe in and they really speak German but they are not German speaking and Denmark had also taken part of old Danish part of</p><p> . Hitler would restore the old strong German. <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> hotels and eat in restaurants all the time, and he convinced me that was necessary. And he sent me to and said I could go there and he would give me money and <span class="page-break" number="6"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You spoke of the government that was neutral in terms of the Germans. Did the government think you were in opposition to it?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: The government chose to make no resistance and in that way could count economically better. If you open a war the who fought with the Germans had no sympathy <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> 0</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Some people wouldn't believe and some people stayed home. I think we brought seven or eight thousand and that about six that would not believe us and stayed at home and wait there until they hear a shot.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was this operation to save the Jews to rescue them and to hid them and then to send them to Sweden, was this one of the largest efforts that was made before 1944? Was this a major effort on the part of the resistance?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The meaning of resistance was that the Allies should win and we should be one of the Allies and Germans should lose. The other thing was a thing of sympathy. That has nothing to do with the end of the war, the Germans. The to win the war was not diminished by news. That was a humanitarian thing. In Denmark we have a distinction where some of our friends were Jews and who were not.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You had many Jewish friends such as Eric Kone and Joseph and Fanny Davidson, what happened to those people?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: There were many Jews in the leftist front in Denmark, and my friends were there and I belonged myself. We were many called themselves Trotskys. There were many sects among the communists, but many Jews were on this leftist part politically and then of course the Jews -- but those who I knew personally they were from the leftist Jewish organizations.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did that make them doubly vulnerable because they were Jews and leftists?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: All those who had been in Nazism all the time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did the rescue, the hiding of the Jews actually take place? Were there doctors who hid the Jews. Whom did you turn to. Whom was the network?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: There were all sort of people. It is true that the doctors in one hospital, a big hospital because they were my friends and I told them about it and mainly Jews who were told not to stay at home were sent to the hospital and people believed that they were ill, and they stayed there until was there and somebody came and took them to the <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> 1</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: About Christmas "42 I knew that now we have come so far that there were four organizations that covered the whole country. Two political parties, the communist party and the party and then which was people from all parties, but I knew they were dominated by government, which was not dominated by the communist, we had nothing against the communist. And the I felt it would be very important if we could make a common organization. We could prevent shoulders from the different organizations and the men who I had to go was . He was a member of the communist party and he was the leading figure in .AndI had to talk with him and we agreed that either no should political parties be in this organization or this should be the both of them. That is something that I said. In the beginning we said, Anna Shotts, who was the leader of the party would not be a member because his . People knew him and we were not as well know. But when we came to Christmas he was in . Then we was eager to <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> 2 Tape #2</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was your life like during this period? I assume that the government was not happy with the activities that you were engaged in?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The government told us that it would be great unhappiness. We felt that the great danger was that when Germany lost the war, which we hoped then we would be considered as the people who helped Nazism. Usually when three people are fighting for the freedom on Europe, it also means the freedom of Denmark, it would not be acceptable to sit and doing nothing when our people were losing their lives to win for our freedom.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you have to move around a great deal?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Already in the first summer in "40, and it came so that we were told that the offices would be central Germany, the military offices. And they came to me and asked me if I could find hiding places, and I had a list of 5,000.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You were saying that you found 5,000 hiding places?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: For the offices, the military offices, but I could use it freely and I was realistic enough to take some of the best for myself. But I never spent more than a week at a place. If I observed the first time that there were some Nazis in the same house, then I left at once.</p><p>But even if there were no signs of that, I never remained in one place more than one week.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you wear different disguises? Did you change your appearance?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not very much. At that time there were very few people yet and I thought that wearing a beard was almost to tell you that you were working underground, so I did not. But I had a very big hair, completely straight and short. And you expect this which was only usual -- [had no reason.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were there many other resistance people who led the same kind of life that you did?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. People who are less known than I was, many people knew me before from books, they were not nearly to take so much caution.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you come into very dangerous contact with the Nazis? Did they ever get close to you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was arrested by Nazis. I was in , or and it was in <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> 3 same time I saw a German patrols, it was on the way to protect their way to</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What happened to your wife during the war?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: When the Jews were persecuted, she was sent to Sweden like the Jews. She got work in Stockholm as a photographer, what she had been in Germany. She had worked in the famous House in Hamberg founded by . And <span class="page-break" number="11"></span> 4</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was the relationship of the Danish police and the resistance movement?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The Danish police is not one person. They had different attitudes. The Danish police of course had to obey the Danish government, that's the usual attitude. But as the military people in the summer of "44 came to us and said they would acknowledge us as the underground government and obey us. The resistance was very much against it and in the same bed later they could . The police were, in my opinion, more loyal to the freedom council than the office.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you felt that you could rely upon them, you could work with them?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yes. But their job was more, not the actual sabotage, but if it should end in a real fight in Denmark, Denmark was divided into six regions and the military man had the command in each of them. That was for fighting. We believe a long time that the British would go ashore in . It came in another way. We didn't know that and as late as the 2nd of May we were not sure who would come first, the Latvians, or the rest of the powers. The Latvians were at . [have the impression that even many communists would prefer that the western powers would come first.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, then the resistance prepared many different eventualities, one was, as I understand, one was the military engagement when the invasion came. What about sabotage? Was that a different part of what the resistance did?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Sabotage was the main thing all the time. We start with information but when I came out of those people and told them about this information and asked them to make local newspapers, somebody wanted to do something more. And we talked about sabotage and some were ready for that. Later we made what we called the military <span class="page-break" number="12"></span> 5</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did you decide?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: First we had to know and that was through the ministers where many of my friends were.</p><p>What the Germans were doing there and there, what was important, who sent their wares to Germany was very important. I could always -- I had some people who were working all the time and ministers who knew everything about that. They could tell us what was important to sabotage.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The trains, the factories, what?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The train was a late thing, but very important. The train was not just delivering wares to Germany. The train was when Hitler needed troops more on the western front, Holland, Belgium and Norway. Then they went through and it was important to make sabotage in the start some trains were blown up but then also some innocent people were killed, and we forbid that and made only railway sabotage. So, the railways when the trains came and had stopped troops for a couple weeks. Sometimes it was</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was there sabotage on the coast also, boats, Danish ships, any of that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I do not know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were any of the Danish boats --?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: At one time, and this is a very great thing, one time we knew that the Germans would take the complete Danish fleet and the high marine officer did sink them.</p><p>That was for only people who knew about it, something. They were sunk. That was a very important thing. That was at . <span class="page-break" number="13"></span> 6</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Why is Denmark different from other European countries in regard to anti-semitism and what happened during the war?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I don't think we are different from Norway or Sweden. Not at all, and I do not know the relationship. The Jews helped the in a difficult position many years ago. <span class="page-break" number="14"></span> 7</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, only one time. I went to Sweden to help Denmark acknowledge as Allies, also by Russians. We did not know who would be first at our friendship. The Russians were very quickly forged through all of Germany and even the Navy could not know. The Danish government had joined the anti-communist pact with Italy and Germany and Spain so we were afraid whether the Russians would consider us helping the Germany. Therefore I proposed in the freedom council that we should take up the relationship with the Soviet Union, which Denmark had broken itself and sent back the ambassador. I proposed</p><p> who was a friend of mine a little family man and they agreed and so I went to Sweden as a fisherman and went through the British Embassy. The Russian Embassy did not know me, the British did, and they told the Russians I was good enough and the Latvians would accept a representative for Denmark, not simply Denmark.</p><p>Then I told them we would send an ambassador who was not very political or we could send a man who had not been an ambassador but who had played a role in the resistance movement and the could prefer whom they wanted. They preferred a man who had been in the resistance movement and he was sent Sweden and was accepted.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was the policy of the freedom council to collaborators. How did you feel Denmark should treat the collaborators?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: The Danish freedom council had made a great complex of laws, who regulates, he was of an organization of all lawyers. He had made that and the political parties also made it and when we compared they were not so different. There was a question of death sentence. We were all against death sentence and it was not within but before we agreed we also had politicians and what these politicians did and I had to go around all Denmark and show it to resistance people. When they heard that there was no death sentence then they said I think we must kill that person before that law is made. I am sure that more people had been killed if I had not returned and told them we have this sentence. As a consequence of judgments and not what we call the</p><p> the long knives night. <span class="page-break" number="15"></span> 8</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: If people are imprisoned they can be . If people have been executed, you cannot give them life again. That's a big difference. But I'm sure we're all against death sentence in Denmark today. There is no -- it was only in this law against , it is not been outlawed in other sorts of criminality. <span class="page-break" number="15"></span> 9</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So when the Jews were rescued in Denmark there was no sense that you were saving them from extermination camps but just from capture by the Germans?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We sort of saved them and found some things, that was enough. What that would be we couldn't know better than that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were there women who were leaders of the resistance in Denmark?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. But we were all in the resistance. The resistance means many things. There are sabotages and there are what we call the illegal army, illegal newspapers and I'm sure many women worked in the newspapers.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And in hiding people?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We had lived in the underground for several years and when I had lived in one place one week, I left it because somebody might have seen me too many times there and they very, very often knew we went and did could tell us a good hiding place.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: As I understand it, there were some disagreements in the freedom council between the parties on the right and on the left between Helga and the social democrats. Did these ever affect the rescue of the Jews, these differences, or was there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I can't answer that. There was no difference. In the freedom council we never thought of who was a social democrat. There were two parties, the communist and the</p><p> and we were unpolitical. I knew the Jews because I was a social democrat but we never spoke of such things.</p><p> (viewing pictures)</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: This is my first wife. She was born in Hamberg and she wanted to go to Israel, but Israel was a British mandate, and to go to Israel they demanded that you have learned an agriculture thing. She was a photographer of x-rays in hospitals. Then she chose to Sweden and learn poultry farming. And one day one of my friends from Hamberg who had come here as a refugee asked me if we should not make a trip to Sweden and there we could meet one of his friends from Hamberg. In that way I met Goldstein.</p><p>She is called , but the two middle things she did not like especially. <span class="page-break" number="16"></span> 0</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: This is about your .
