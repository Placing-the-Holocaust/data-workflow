<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And the Germans come into Krakow?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you're forced to wear a yellow band or a star?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And then what happened.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Then what happened is that the apartment below us was -- belonged to Jews and the German -- what do you call that -- German mayor.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: German mayor, new mayor of Krakew was put into that apartment because the people were furriers and they went to Americ</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So the apartment was empty. And like I said, it was a beautiful home, oh, gorgeous, the one from the furrier and good enough for the mayor to take it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You said it had belonged to Jews?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. I don't know if the whole building belonged to Jews, that apartment I know belonged to Jews.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were not living there?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So that's unimportant too. We -- after awhile we were asked, not asked to move, but we were thrown out of the building because of the Germans moved into our apartment.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You and your mother were thrown out?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right. And we were moved in to our apartment in a different section of town. I can't even tell you what section that was because I wasn't that familiar with Krakow.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uhu.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes. Like actions?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. Any that they come in and, you know, throw you out again or take your belongings.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We were -- at that point we were -- we had that thing on the door. Of course later on it didn't mean nothing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you had some protection in the beginning?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We had some protection in the beginning and that didn't last, of course, and we had to move again. And this time we had to move outside the city of Krakow and my stepfather was back in the meantime, he came back.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: He came back?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He came back, yeah. He never made it to where we wanted to go and he came back. I mean, it wasn't just him alone, quite a few men tried to get away and it didn't work.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. So he came back and was living in the other apartment in Krakow or to the place to the other town that you had moved to?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, it was like a suburb of Krakow.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Krakow. You don't happen to remember the name of it, do you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. But I have still a little book from my mother that she made with addresses.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: IfT only would know what I did with it. Since I moved from my house here to this small apartment I don't know where anything is. But should I find it, I would be able -- I would think that it might be in there. I don't remember.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Anyhow we lived in one room, my father, my mother, and myself. Out, you know, like in the field someplace. We had no bathroom. We had to go outside to outdoor bath, and we lived with people who owned that -- oh, God, it's hard for me to explain all that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It was like a building?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: A farmhouse. Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And we lived in one of the rooms.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And the farmer lived, you know, on the premises and we shared that room out there with them. And how long did we live there? I don't think too long. My mother got sick.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: While you were living in the farmhouse?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. My mother got sick and she was taken to the hospital and she never came back from the hospital. She got blood poisoning.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Blood poisoning?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. And passed away.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. And you were with your stepfather?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And I'm with my stepfather. In the meantime, Krakow was opening up a ghetto and my stepfather did not want me to go into the ghetto because he had to go to work and I would be alone all day.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It must have been hard for you at the time, I mean.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, it was. That's why I don't really like to talk about it because it brings up, you know, it stirs everything up. Like one woman here tells me I'm like an ostrich, I like to put my head into the ground because I have -- because there are so many bad, bad things.</p><p>I left some out too. We tried to get back to Katowice and how we were thrown out on the middle of the road, the Germans caught us, and all little details which would take forever to explain.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Please share whatever you want to share because we have as much time as you need.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I know but...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I'd like to hear everything that you're willing to share with us.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [know but, you know, as I talk new things come up again.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Then I interrupt myself and what I was saying and spit out the new things so I better forget some of the things because really it would take three years on the phone, as long as the war was, four years.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. So you're having a hard time at this point because your mother had passed away and you're living in a farmhouse with your stepfather.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. And my stepfather had to register to move into the ghetto, which was being raised in Krakow for all the Jews to get in. And, like I said, he -- my grandmother, in the meantime, and my aunt and my cousin, they had to leave Katowice because Katowice was made Judenfrei.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Jewish free?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. No Jews in Katowice. That was a birthday present for Hitler from Katowice.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That Katowice -- so my rest of my family, like I said, my grandmother, my aunt, my cousin, they had to go to Chrzanow or Krenau. I don't know if you heard that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q:How far is that from Katowice?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think it would be just between, the middle between Katowice and Krakow. I think maybe the middle. I have no idea how many miles or anything. I never...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you know how to spell the town?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. In German it is K, like in King, R, like in Robert, E like in Edward, N like in Nelly, A like in apple, and U like in united.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And in Polish it is C like in Charles, H like in Harry, R like in Robert, Z like in Zebra, A like in apple, N like in Nelly, O like in orange -- Chrzanow -- I think W.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you believe that's somewhere in-between Katowice and Krakow?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. I can look it up for you. I have an iPad, I could check it out.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: We can try to find that later.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Okay. Fine. So what my stepfather did, he spoke to my aunt over the phone, I assume, or sent me a letter that he doesn't want me to go into the ghetto and he wanted me to be with my family anyway. And so it was arranged that I am going to go live with my grandmother.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And that I did. And that I remember I was on a train.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. I know that my stepfather, since he came back, I was told, he ended up in a camp too.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. So first he was put in the ghetto in Krakew?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He was, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And then was sent to a camp?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I understand.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And had Nazis come to power in that town as well?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, Nazis were all over. The Nazis took over Poland completely.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. So you remember the Nazis there when you went to go live with your grandmother and your aunt?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. Because more or less that was like a ghetto where we lived already. I mean, it was where all the Jews lived.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So you weren't in the ghetto in Krakow --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- but you ended up being in the ghetto --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, it wasn't open yet on that day.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: But it was open. It was such a small -- it was a tiny town. I mean, really they couldn't even block it off if they wanted to.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We were put into cattle cars.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you allowed to bring anything with you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think so because I know I took my party dress.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: One suitcase.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't know if I went back because I know I wanted the dress. If I told my aunt that I - - but I didn't see my aunt anymore, we were separated. So that wouldn't make any sense, would it?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uhu.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because, like I later found out, my whole family I never heard from them again.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I really don't. I only know that that's where we arrived. And we were 150 women and we had barracks, which were really not as bad as my next stop. We had barracks and bunk beds, there was even a stove in the middle which -- and there was a big factory right next to the barracks and we started working in the factory that was spinning, spinnery, but spinnery is not what people think, we were making thread.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Thread? Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: From flax. Yeah. And I was servicing the machines about 150 -- oh, maybe not that many, I don't remember exactly how many spools on the machine. And if they needed -- once the spools filled up, you had to take them off and put empty spools on again, and that's what we used to do. And I must have been more ambitious because I wanted a machine, I wanted to run a machine. | didn't want to be running from machine to machine.

Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And then you were taken to a factory in the morning?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. It was right actually next door. The barracks were put up so that you really didn't have to, you just walked but of course you had guards.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You had live-in guards so, and when we wanted to write a letter to our family, if we worked, for instance, after hours in the field -- we worked 12 hours, from 6:00 to 6:00.</p><p>And then if you -- in summertime if you wanted to work in the fields, we would get to write a letter. And then the worst thing, which I do remember, is that they took us to a basement. People had potatoes in the basements, you know, by the bushel. I don't -- are you anything -- are you anything familiar with Germany at all?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes, a bit. A bit.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But you don't know how people lived?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But describe it to me the best that you remember.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Okay. Well, in the basement people used to stock up with potatoes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And the potatoes, many times, if the winter wasn't that cold, started rotting away. And from rotting away you had thousands and thousands of little flies. You know those food flies?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Food flies.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. And they needed those basements cleaned out and we had to do it.

They didn't. You did it. But sometimes you got, you know, you got curb (ph) for it, like a letter to write or sometimes you got nothing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So that was not the worst camp really, that was really because the accommodations were horrible, I mean, they were bad enough but not horrible.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can you tell me a little bit about the barracks that you stayed in with the other women?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. Well, the barracks were fairly -- they were new actually. They were a light wood. They were -- we had bunkers and we had -- we slept on wood and hay, like hay stuff, but at least it was clean in there and there was some heat. I don't remember the bathroom facilities anymore in that particular place, I do not remember them. But they couldn't have been too bad because it didn't make any impression on me. Where the other camp I was in, I remember those vividly.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, all of the women that you had come with from your grandmother's town on the cattle cart, were you all together in the barracks and working in the factories?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Or was there some sort of selection process when you got there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. There was -- there was -- some might have gone further to another camp and some might have gone to another factory. Not everybody came to be -- were all together, no.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. I'm sorry to -- can I go back for one minute?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can you just tell me a little bit about the conditions of the cattle car on your way to the camp?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The cattle car, the cattle car is -- what conditions do you want? We were like cattle.</p><p>We were -- we had no room to breathe because there were more people, it wasn't just the women from, from, from Chrzanow.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Chrzanow.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: There were other people too from other little cities.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You had called it I think before a station.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, like an assembly hall, let's say.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Like everybody was assembled in that spot and then we were put into, I guess, different categories. You know, they had other factories too, not only where I worked.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uhu.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Other factories were some people used to work in the fence and I don't know what else the Germans used you for. But like I said, I can't think now what everybody worked and I only know what we worked in.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. Right. And what kind of clothes did you wear while you were there? Did they give you like a uniform?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. I don't think so. I, I really honestly don't think so.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. And did you still have your belongings at this point, like the little suitcase that you had with your party dress or had that been taken way from you by now?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I think I still had it. Because I know when I came back in 1945 when I came back to Katowice, I wore my winter coat because I was so skinny. The kids used to call me that I looked like a herring. They used to call me herring, that was like an insult. So I didn't want to go without a coat. So I must have kept my clothes because I remember the winter coat.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: [know I had jewelry, which I got my ring from my mother, and the first one to -- when they called you have to give things up, I was they used to say ukopods (ph) and</p><p> + they -- used to call me ukopods (ph) because I used to be the German and, you <span class="page-break" number="20"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Twelve hours.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [know we got black coffee in the morning. I know we were always hungry. We got - - Iremember the soups that was if you knew the person who was dispensing the soup, you might have gotten a potato in the water that they called soup or you got just water with a little bit of potato flavor.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uhu.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And then you got -- I remember you got, you had one round loaf and at first it was cut into four so each one got a quarter of that round loaf. I think it must have been a two pound loaf. And then later on in the years, as supplies got more skimpy, we only got then it was cut into an eighth of a loaf.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So if you were able to keep it and just have a bite, good, but I couldn't. So J ate it all up and then I had to wait for the next portion. And I think that was, in the last few years I think that was for three days.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you said that there were guards watching you in the factory all day?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. We had guards standing in the entrance in each entrance of the particular division where we were working.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. And what were they like?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was women. You know, women with women is not good.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uhu.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because these were girls who were nothing and now they were big shots because they had the face of, you know, what to do. But that camp wasn't as bad so I won't even say anything about this camp.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was -- since I have a comparison between fair and terrible, I will leave it for the next camp.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And we were in -- we were next to Trautenau and that is -- I can't think of the name now, of the place. You have to give me a little time, it slipped my mind.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. No problem. We'll try to come back to it when it comes to mind.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. So you got off the cattle cart and you were marched to this old abandoned factory.</p></p></dialogue>

Parshnitz, that's the name of where we were.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You know how to spell that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No, I would love for you to spell it for me, please.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Okay. It's P like in Peter, A like in apple, R like in Robert, S like in Sam, H like in Harry, N like in Nelly, I like in Ida, and T like in Tom, and Z, I think there's a Z at the end like in Zebr</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A:</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Parshnitz?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. So tell me more about the factory.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Okay. So, No. 1, we had no bathroom facilities except open stalls. And when you went to the bathroom, there was a line in front of you waiting to take the next seat but you had no privacy whatsoever. I mean really, so that was getting used -- I mean, you have people standing right on top of you waiting for you to get -- that was terribly dehumanizing. We had no hot water, only cold water. No toothbrushes, no nothing because --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So anything you had taken with you from the old camp you no longer had?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes. We had the clothing, I think. Because, like I said, that coat was --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: The winter coat, right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. So I must have had some clothing with me. But I don't think we were wearing clothing there, our clothing. I think we wore a uniform in this camp.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I can't remember. Don't forget it's 60 years later.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes, of course. No. You're doing great. Whatever, whatever comes to mind you let me know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Okay. Well, that was -- like I said, that was a terrible place. I did the same thing like I did in the other, in the other factory.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Making the thread?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you working in the same place that you were living?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No. No. We had --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So you were living in the old factory but they brought you somewhere else to work?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Exactly. They took us to a factory that was working.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was it close by to where you were living?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, we had to march over there every morning through ice and snow or not.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We were, we were -- now we were more people. This was a camp for 2,000 people.</p><p>From 150 we were 2,000, and we had 500, I understand, Hungarian women from Auschwitz that came that were there too in our camp.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay. And where were the other people from besides Auschwitz and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Mostly from Poland, they're mostly Polish people. You see what they did too is that from Poland they sent the people to Czechoslovakia, and from Czechoslovakia they sent the people from Poland or Germany, because they didn't want you to run into anybody familiar. Like let's say you would know a guard or something, this way you didn't know anybody because you came from different parts of the country, of the countries. I think that was the main objective.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So now we had guards that were standing in front inside the barracks -- not barracks, we weren't in a barracks -- inside our sleeping quarters and we were counted every morning, like when we went to work. And if it -- if somebody was missing, we would be standing in the cold in wintertime, of course, forever and the day until they found the person that was missing -- and I'm jumping again.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But it's really -- where we lived was hell, that's what I told you. And the guards, when we wanted to go to the bathroom, we had to excuse ourselves. And if the guards said, no, you can't go right now, we couldn't go.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: So we had to --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay. Did you also have guards in your sleeping quarters?</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. <span class="page-break" number="28"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not in the sleeping quarters in the factory, in the entrance and exits in the factory. So if you wanted to leave your post and go to the bathroom, you just couldn't do it without asking the guard who was standing between you and the bathroom.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. And the guards again spoke German?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The guards spoke German. Maybe they spoke Polish too or Czech, I don't know. I spoke fluently Germany so for me it was, you know, no -- I had no problem speaking German so I...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And the factory that were working -- you were those 150 women and then more people from the camp?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: More people from different places that were sent there too.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So it made -- like I said, we were 2,000 people among the factory.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. And can you tell me about your meals at this place?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My meals, what meals?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: We used to say, "Too much to die from and too little to live on."</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So it was a starvation diet. It really was. And I don't know how much longer, you know, we could have done it. Because we were all losing our strength. Because if you don't get enough nourishment and all you do is work.... Unfortunately I was in my growing stages and that's why I have so many hang ups right now, I think. Maybe I would have had those anyway but I'm blaming everything on these years whatever I have.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. Iunderstand. Did you make any friends in this camp?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Friends, I made friends. A girlfriend that I, to this day we are in touch, when I was in Chrzanow, in Krenau with my grandmother -- I'm going backwards.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I made friends with her and she's in Australia and we are --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But she wasn't sent to these camps with you?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, no. We met after the war.</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. <span class="page-break" number="29"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay. And what else can you tell me about this camp Trautenau? Was it very crowded?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, yeah, it was crowded because all we had is bunk beds -- they're not bunk beds. I always say bunk beds, they're not. One bunk bed, single.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right, single beds.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, and that was what the whole thing was, just beds. And an entrance to that bathroom where they stood in line in front of you or I stood in line in front of them, whoever was on the potty. And there was no, nothing else, except cold. It was cold in there because I think the factory was cold anyway because of the flooring, stone flooring and no heat. And, yeah, you know what I forget to tell you, that I was in England too.</p><p>But I can't -- you know something, it really -- my life is so, there is so much more. I forgot to tell you after I came back in from the -- oh, that is really later. What am I saying?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Later, we'll get to that. We'll get to that. That's after the war. Right?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. Are you going to be with me on the phone till tomorrow morning?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Don't worry.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Really it's too -- I talk too too much. I maybe should cut it shorter a little bit because...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I think you're doing fine, but if you feel like you want to stop or take a break, that's okay. Whatever works for you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: What time is it now?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It's 3:10.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: 3:10. Another half an hour but that's going to be it then.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Okay. No problem. Okay. So we're still talking about this camp. In this camp, where you said there were so many people, were there men in this camp or still only women?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Only women.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Only women. Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We had men one time -- towards the end of the war, they were dissolving camps. You know, we weren't that far from the Brzeznica, to get you an idea, you know what the Brzeznica?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes, of course.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. <span class="page-break" number="30"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So we were not too far from the Brzeznica, that's a vicinity at least from Parshnitz and Trautenau is, and before the end of the war they were dissolving camps and we had the transport coming through with only men. And we didn't want -- I don't know, the British -- I was liberated by the Russians. That camp, where they had the men coming through -- I don't know who would have liberated them -- but to tell you these men could hardly walk, they were dying. They were dying by the hundreds. And they came overnight to park their bodies in our camp. And in the morning, when we woke up there was like a wagon full with corpses of men lying outside and on the wagon, and they pushed these men further and further to walk because they didn't want them to be liberated.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And that was the only time we had men in the -- hardly men because they were more dead than alive. It was incredible.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And so all your guards were also again women?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, except the guards on the outside. Like we had like in prison they have these patrol things, they were normal looking, and those were men, I think.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. And were those Nazi personnel?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That I cannot tell you. I had no contact with anybody except for the women to ask them if I'm allowed to go to the bathroom or not.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. And the prisoners, the other women who were with you, did you treat each other well at that time as well?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I think the Hungarian and the people from -- that were not from Hungary, I don't think they liked each other too much, why I could not tell you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Okay. But you sensed some tension between them?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Then we had lice sections where we all were -- I mean, infections.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Lice.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: We were, a bunch of woman, we were disrobed. Whatever we had on, we had to give up. They shaved our heads and to check us for lice. We were defumed --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- of lice. And we had no -- they took our hair off -- oh, that was wonderful too, that was another wonderful experience. And there was another incident which was horrible</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. <span class="page-break" number="31"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> when we were all sitting naked around, and just to think about it make me shudder. And so that was -- what else would you like to know about that camp which was a horrible camp?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was there ever a time there that you got sick?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You didn't want to get sick because if you got sick and you couldn't work, they had every months transported, transports that picked you up and you were gone and never heard of again. So you really didn't want to get sick.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So somehow you managed to get up and go to work every day?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. And like I said to you, we got too much to die from and too little to exist from.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did anyone ever escape from the camp?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't think so. People had no energy. They had no, no strength to go anywhere.</p><p>Maybe that's why they kept us so -- and the guards all over, and lights, and they had these beamers going. I don't think so. I don't remember. Don't forget, 2,000 women you can't know what everybody's doing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. Of course. Of course. And you didn't have any contact with anyone outside of the camp, right?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not from that camp, no, no.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. And did you know anything about what was going on, sort of in the outside world?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In the first camp we heard that the English or the Americans -- I don't think America was yet in the war when we were there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We heard a little, but in the second camp we didn't hear nothing, we didn't know anything.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And were there any sort of like executions or killings that went on while you were in the camp?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. I didn't see anybody being executed. No. Like I said, we had these transports and they picked up the people who weren't productive anymore and I think those were sent to Auschwitz.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So whoever, whoever didn't make it it was because of hunger or, or they got sick?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Or being sick, right.</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. <span class="page-break" number="32"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Exactly. And they -- that's why people didn't want to get sick or didn't let themselves be sick.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You know, you push and push till you really drop dead, practically, because otherwise you wouldn't dare.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. Is there anything else you remember that you want to share about this camp?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. I was wishing for somebody to come and get us out of there not knowing who to wish for, or who was in the war or not.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. And you were in this camp for how long?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: To the last day of war, the 8th of May, 1945. The last of last days. That is the official, I think the 8th of May is the official date when the war really ended.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Wow.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And that's the date when the Russians liberated us.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So before you were liberated did you know that that time was coming?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did anything change in the camp in the days prior?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. They kept -- the guards were all gone.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: All the guards, from outside and inside. And we knew something was up.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because that was a -- that was the telltale that something was going on. Who is coming or what is coming or why is it coming, we didn't know. But we knew, you know, that there is something better ahead.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. So you said May 8, 1945?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. Like I said, the last, the very, very last day.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So what happened on that day?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: On that day the Russians came.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>

I mean, you know, we were jubilant that we have -- that the Germans are gone. That we are free, that much we knew.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And what some of the women did, they went to town -- they got their strength, they ate -- first of all, everybody ate and ate, whatever the Russians brought us. And then of course a lot of people got sick because their stomach couldn't take what -- to digest all that food. And then the women who had more strength, or some of them, they went to town, to Trautenau, and I understand they smash all the windows, the store fronts, and were -- what do you call that, taking merchandise?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Looting.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, they were looting the stores, which really wasn't very great, but that's what they did. And the Russians, of course, helped them. Maybe they went with the Russians on their Jeeps. I don't know how they got downtown, but they did. And I had to go to bed. I went to bed because I was so weak that I just let go.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So from May till I think August I didn't go back to my home town because I just couldn't. I had to recuperate, but anyhow...</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In, in -- over there, I stayed in the camp.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, okay.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And how did the Russians treat you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They treated us right, I think. I, you know, I don't know. I understand there were some rapes too. Of course nobody, you know, I didn't have that problem because nobody would even look at me twice, never mind once. And I was so dumb. I was so naive. I didn't even know what was going on in camp, women between women, I had no -- I swear to you I had no idea that something like this existed. I was a very dumb, young woman -- young girl, I wasn't a woman.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You had said that you were also younger than most of the women who were there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, I was. I was always the youngest because I was one of the youngest taken.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you stayed there until August with the Russians?</p></p></dialogue>

And then again cattle car because, you know, we had no other transportation but cattle cars, they wouldn't take us and we had no money to pay for anything.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So the Russians took you by cattle car?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. We just took a cattle car. They -- not the Russians didn't take us but we got a certificate from the camp who took over the director for the camp.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uhu.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He give us a certificate that we spent, you know, so much time in the camp and to please give us, you know, more or less a courtesy, show us some courtesy and that same piece of paper we travelled with because we had no other identification.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you decided to go back to Katowice?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And another two women, sisters who lived outside of Katowice, were with me on that particular trip back to Katowice.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And why did you want to go back there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because I thought maybe somebody from my family is back. You know, I didn't know that nobody is going to be back.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And that's the only place I knew, where I grew up. I knew my mother wouldn't be there. But, you know, my aunt, I thought somebody's going to, my cousin maybe.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Of course nobody was back and I didn't know what to do with myself. And those two ladies were nice enough and they said they were going to take me home with them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The ladies that had travelled with you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, they were travelling. They came from camp too but they were more mature women than I was and they knew exactly where they were going.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. And did you register when you got to Katowice?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

I went to the Jewish, to the Jewish --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Registry?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- registry and I registered. And of course I was looking for somebody that I knew from my family, of course. Like I said to you before, nobody was there. And I thought I'll go back to the train and I throw myself under the train, really because I didn't know what to do. Everybody -- Katowice was normal already because Katowice was liberated in January.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So more time had gone by?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, had gone by. And they were back to normal, you know, what normal was.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And here I didn't know where to go. My grandmother had a house in Poland that she owned. Not a house, an apartment building but there was strange people living in there, I didn't know anybody. And like I said, if not for the two women that took me, I would have not known what to do with myself.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. So you went with them?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So I went with them and maybe three weeks later, or something like that, my stepfather came.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He survived the war.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Wow.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And he went to the Jewish welfare, whatever that was where I registered, and found out where I was and came over there. And of course I was very, very happy to see him.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I'm sure.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And he then took me away from those ladies and we were together. And we built -- and we lived in a, got a room together. And I don't know if it was my grandma's home, but I don't think there was anything open, if he decided to evacuate, I don't know that. I don't -- like I said, I don't know how but we were together and how long, not even a year, because there was a lady who lived in my grandmother's house and she -- and my stepfather and her became friendly, and then my stepfather had his sister living in London, England.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: A sister, okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: His sister.</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, the one that you had moved into their apartment?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. That's right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: There was a children transport going to London from Katowice, and my aunt in London arranged for me to come as a domestic.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Why did you -- why did your stepfather want to send you to England as opposed to staying there with him?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because he felt I had no future. The Russians were there and he figured I will have no future in Poland. He said if I go to England, it's going to be more of a future for me than in Poland. And eventually he got married to that lady and I think maybe they wanted me out. That I realized later on when I got a little wiser that maybe they felt it would be better for me not to be there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you know when this was?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: When that was when I got to England?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: In 1946,</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay. So you weren't in Katowice that long --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- before going to London?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. I went to London.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So someone was arranging a transport?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah. It came from London from a Dr. Schonfeld, I remember --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Doctor who? Can you spell that for me?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [hope that's the right name. He was -- he worked for the -- for one of the organizations and he arranged the transport.</p><p>This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was actually a children transport and for that transport I was already old.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because at that time I think I was already 18. In 1945, I was 18. Right. And those were all smaller kids. Like I said, it was a children transport but somehow I got on it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And what was the name of the doctor again? I'm sorry.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think Schonfeld, something like that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Schonfeld. Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Something. Yeah. Don't hold me to exactly information --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay. No problem.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Because I even have pictures from the boat where he is on because we docked right at the London Bridge in London. London Tower, London Bridge. London Tower. I don't think there's a bridge called London Tower but --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Tower of London?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. We came right into London. Docked right into London, in main London.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. How was that trip?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was another disappointment because here I was and I thought everybody is going to say, oh that poor girl, look at what she did -- had gone through in her young life. And I be -- everybody going to feel sorry forme. Aye-yi-yi did I get a rude awakening. My aunt, I mean, my step-aunt actually, really she said as domestic and that's what I became.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hmm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And I most normally didn't have the best of manners and she was a stickler for manners, which maybe was good because I learned quite a bit from her.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But it was a hard life. It really was a rude awakening. And she had a friend, a young woman who lived in the same building, and I could hear complaining about me. And I was so lonely and I was so unhappy but I grew up.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. Did you stay in contact with your step-father?</p></p></dialogue>

I stayed in contact with my step-father and as a matter of fact, she was the one who wrote a lot, long, long letters because we didn't have iPhone or T-phones or whatever.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Like we have now.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And did you go to school while you were living with your aunt?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I went to the Northwest Polytechnic at night and guess what I took up? Instead of learning how to speak English, I took up Russian.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Wow. Why did you decide to do that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because I thought it so close to Polish that it's going to be easy.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was my thinking, very smart. But I didn't take up English. I learned English.</p><p>Maybe not a hundred -- I mean, I'm not really that fluent because I have words missing but my age has something to do with it too.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, your English, your English is very good.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. Well, I worked -- after a couple of years with my aunt, I learned enough English that I went and looked for a job.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did she have other -- did she have children?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: She had one son who lived in Manchester, he was attending the University of Manchester.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So he wasn't living in her house with you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. He came to visit sometimes and he was my first love too, really. So that, that was that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It must have been hard, you know, at first not speaking the language.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, it was.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You know, was there any sort of discrimination or --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- other problems you had?</p></p></dialogue>

Like I joined a club too, I don't know which club I joined in. I don't think it was Bacop</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't remember. You know, the people went out at night and there were a lot of foreigners in that club, not all British people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And everybody was jabbering away and I was sitting there, I didn't know one thing. I didn't -- I couldn't participate. And I loved to talk, as you have noticed. I came back and I was again, you know, so frustrating to be out with people and not, not to be able to participate.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. Of course.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But I did learn and I did make up for it and that is part of my life, that was part of growing up for me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So how long were you living with your aunt in England?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Until 1951.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: "51?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Too much. Too much. Anyhow, they found out through my stepfather that I -- you know what, I should write a book.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You should.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Anyhow, yeah, let's go to another subject. What should we talk about, it's already time.</p></p></dialogue>

And we met and they said you have no future here, we going to see that we can get an affidavit for you to come to Americ</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Of course they couldn't give me an affidavit because they themselves needed an affidavit to come to Americ</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: But again I have a relative in Akron, Ohio -- or had, I don't think she's still alive -- Dr. Proscauer (sp) and him I didn't even know. I know his wife --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- when I was a young kid. And he put up an affidavit --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- for me. A man I have never seen. Anyhow, I waited, I think, two years for it to materialize to come to Americ</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A:</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: What happened to the man you were dating for those two years?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, the man I was dating was a Vietnamese man. He was a young man, he was same age I was. And I thought when I -- my relatives said you coming to America, like I said, you have nothing here, there's nothing for you here and blah-blah-blah -- so I already told you about the affidavit.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uhu.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So I thought when I tell him that I am going to America, he's going to say, well, darling, don't leave, we going to get married, but instead he said bye bye.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So that didn't happen. And I left to go to America and I came to America on the Ist of January, 1956.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Well, I live in New York but --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh, you live there.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And there was a son living in the house. And like I said, I had a room there for me that they made up. And I -- then after a couple of days I went and registered with the unemployment office, or whatever I had to do get my, I don't know, social security, if that was already, that I don't remember either. Anyhow, I got a job in the garment center.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. And I didn't like the job because I rather do office work instead of being in the garment center, didn't particularly like that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So I went to the unemployment office again and told them I was laid off and I'm looking for ajob. And I got called, I got called for an interview to -- do you know Chamber Street? Of course you know.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And at lunchtime again I helped my -- the office manager, who was the accountant too, I helped to type bills.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And then I got that job to type, to be a billing clerk. And that was so much fun. I sat right next to him and he was the most wonderful person you would want to work for.</p><p>And there I stayed until the day I came to Toledo, Ohio. So here I am now and got married. I met my husband shortly after I came to Toledo.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did you end up getting to Toledo?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: How did I end up -- my husband -- I became pregnant. After my doctor said I will never have any kids, because we were married five years and nothing, and the doctor said you just won't have any children. Well, did I fool him. I became pregnant and we didn't want to raise a family in New York. So my husband looked for employment out of New York and he got a job in Toledo, and that's how we came to Toledo. And it was hard. It was really hard. Our beginning here was very, very hard because we expected Toledo to be something what it wasn't. You know, we are here now 55 years.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Wow.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And it changed, Toledo grew quite a bit in those 55 years. And it's still a hick town, even 55 years later. So it wasn't easy. But now, you know, now I'm at the end of the rope anyway so it doesn't matter anymore.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you had children together?</p></p></dialogue>

We came in January and I delivered my daughter on March the 4th, highly pregnant.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And how did you adjust to sort of, you know, normal life after what you had experienced?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Ladjusted actually quite well, you know, because a lot of people couldn't adjust.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Do you know that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes. Absolutely.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. Because a lot of people couldn't handle it. And I -- I am pretty much happy- go-lucky and I think that helped me. Maybe, maybe not deep enough -- you know, you can call it anything you want to. I'm not a deep thinker.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I mean, do you think that your experiences during the war sort of -- you know, how did it affect you raising your family and your children and, you know, just sort of the values that you live with now?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I felt to be -- really started out, you know, it was hard. I didn't bring anything into the marriage. I know my husband definitely didn't marry me for money because all I had was two turtles, so that wasn't very much. And I gave my kids anything I could, whatever we could give. Because I always said, you never know what can happen. I always have that in front of me to this day, I have that in front of me as far as money is concerned now. You know, do I have enough money? Will I be able to make it to the day that I no longer will? That's how I think now. And I believe in giving too. I like to give with warm hands and not with cold hands, so that is more or less how I changed. But I always was a giver even when I was a child.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So it might not be just the camp. I don't know if it changed me. I -- maybe I value things more than I would have any other time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Maybe I value friendships too more. I value human life more.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You must enjoy spending time with your grandchildren.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh, very much so. Unfortunately being that I -- I am so tied down with the machines I have and can't go out without carrying oxygen with me -- and yesterday I was -- I had to go to a rheumatology specialist and I have -- oh my God, what is it called, that sickness?</p><p>Fibromy --</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you had some health problems over the years?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yeah. I have, I have bad ears; I have bad eyes; I have bad body; I can't breathe.</p><p>But otherwise I'm doing wonderful, as long as my mouth can go.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And your husband's still alive?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. I lost my husband 11, it's going to be 11 years in February.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, I'm sorry.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So, and I had to give up my house because I couldn't, I couldn't handle it anymore and I was so attached to my house and that bothers me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right, I'm sure.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. I live now in adult living place and of course after home I had a very nice, brand new -- when we moved in -- brand new ranch house. And I loved my house. And I had a dog and I had my kids and I had my husband. And I had to give everything up.</p><p>And the kids are married, you know, they live their own life. I mean, I talk to them daily.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Two and three times a day.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And they live close by?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, in Toledo everything is close by.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's the furthest.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, that's good then.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. Okay. You think we more or less, more or less we have it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes, I do.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Absolutely. I'm sure we'll use everything. And if there's anything that you decide later that you want to still talk to me about or you want to add, you know, please let me know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>And if there's anything that you have from the war that you'd like to share with the museum, I'm sure that they would love to make copies of any documents you have or any pictures you have.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I do. Ido but I don't -- my daughter has them because I have one room and a bedroom and it's really not the biggest.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right.
