And -- and she was a registered nurse, and of course, during the -- in Poland she didn't work, because my father is an officer, made very good salary.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not really, not really, th -- the only communication, he was writing the Polish consulate in -- in -- in -- about -- asking about some of his papers, but I don't -- I didn't see any postcards from -- from his parents, so it, of course, when Bolsheviks took it over, probably i-if you are sending letters, they probably threw it in a round file. The circle file.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, did he talk much about his underground activities during World War I?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, that's true. Do you know the name of this military academy that was in Russia?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not really. Probably Kiev military academy or something.

And one of the guy from Serbian society, he went to Ukraine about five, 10 years ago, and they paid him for his house which he had over there.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And did they have girls? I'm sorry, I interrupted you. You -- I -- were they the only two boys, or were there more children in that family?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's what I am aware of, because I haven't discuss it with my father, but I know for sure that him and his brother, because he lived in same town.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Of course, of course. Tell me a little bit about your mother's family. Were they also landowners? <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> Interview with Eugene Chmielowski deg January 31, 2015</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That -- I don't know too much about my mother's family, but evidently they were well-to-do, because she -- she graduated as a registered nurse. At the time it was like at the university, at that level. So evidently, you -- they could afford to send her, you know, to -- for her education. So evidently they were doing okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And was her family also in this Vinnytsia - Kiev area?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Evidently so, because you know, when the -- my father and they met, so that they had to be someplace in the area.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Which -- which to me suggests that -- did you know any of her family members?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>It sounds like you didn -- you wouldn't have had the chance to do so.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, there was a elderly woman that used to live with us. She was a part of my mother's family, but I don't know what was her relationship to -- to my grandparents there. But she lived with us, about 95 when she died.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see. Okay. But this is also unusual for the people that I've talked to, that so much of your parents" families were on the other side of the border. And that that border was closed, you know, during the 1920s, and the 1930s. Most people had their families around them. The larger families. Did you -- before World War IL, did you visit with your doctor uncle much? Did you see each other often?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yes, they used to come over to our house, we used to go to their house. And by the way, we were doing much better to hear that he's a doctor. <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> Interview with Eugene Chmielowski " January 31, 2015</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, if your father was a high ranking officer, that would -- that would make sense.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, of course they were talking about Bolsheviks, how bad they were, and so on. But as far as Germany, England, I don't think they discuss it ver-very much. Of course, my father thought that after 20 years, the Bolsheviks became more human.</p><p>As it turned out, they weren't.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. So they -- beca -- did they talk about Bolsheviks more because they were from the east? <span class="page-break" number="26"></span> Interview with Eugene Chmielowski *deg January 31, 2015</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Exactly.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Let me think. You mentioned before, your sister came to take care of your mother a little bit, in August of 1939. And your father begged her to stay, and he said, the war is coming, the war is coming.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did -- did -- did he have some sort of inside information, or was this something everybody felt?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It's everybody felt that it's a matter of days. As a matter of fact, he -- he got the letter from -- from the army that they inducting him back.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: He's being mobilized.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Mobilized, right. And he became the chief -- chief of anti-aircraft defensive cover, except they didn't have an air -- aircrafts.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So -- so at that point, he was 51 years old?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Do you remember the day the war broke out?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yes, I do.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell me about it. <span class="page-break" number="27"></span> Interview with Eugene Chmielowski * January 31, 2015</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, listening to radio. Radio that day used to say, this plane is crossing our border, this plane is doing this, and the Warsaw is bombed, and other towns are bombed, and so on. So it's a--</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did -- how -- what was -- when your parents heard this, and when people in the -- in Kovel heard this, how -- how were people behaving? How were they reacting to this news?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I think they took it in stride. For example, we -- we lived -- we lived close to downtown, and on one occasion we went to the -- where there was a army headquarters, and they have a army mess over there, and we went there for lunch, with my father, mother. And as we were having lunch, all of a sudden the planes came over. You could see the faces of the pilots, and one of the lieutenants says, oh, those are Polish, because they got Polish insignia on the planes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did they really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They did. And as he said they are Polish, they started shooting. So we went -- run away from the building, and there were some planes over there, so we hid in there.</p><p>So that was like probably third and fourth of September.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Amazing that they were so close you could see the faces. <span class="page-break" number="28"></span> Interview with Eugene Chmielowski * January 31, 2015</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. They -- well, there was no aircrafts. And the -- later my father got couple with those aircraft guns, so then they were flying very high. Evidently they had some space on the ground.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So those first few weeks, your -- was that as close as you got to someone from the German military --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- was this person in the plane?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Or did you see soldiers on the ground?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not German, Russians.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. But before we come to the Russians, those first weeks before they -- they arrive, what were people doing? What was happening in Kovel?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, they were going to work, and I think schools were closed, because they made the hospital with those schools. So -- and I was going to go to the fourth grade, but never happened. And --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: By the way, were there Jewish people in Kovel?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Quite a few, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And what professions did they usually have, or jobs, or trades?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Running businesses, running businesses, what else? <span class="page-break" number="29"></span> Interview with Eugene Chmielowski 8 January 31, 2015</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Did your family know any? Did you have any interaction?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh yes. My mother had a good relationship with those Jewish people, because she was running that orphanage, so she needed some funds. So they -- they were --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Supporting it.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Of course, where we lived, the owner of this house was Jew, too, and -- and I was talking with his son. His son was six, seven years older, and I was telling him that we going to beat Germans, and this guy says, no way, they're too strong. Of course, he was 15, or something.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, two military experts having a conversation.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Exactly, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, people still continued going to work, even though there was no school. What was the talk that was going on?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, really, we didn't interact with -- with the outside world, you know, we just --my mother, father, and myself, except for that trip that we made to that military mess over there. Cassino(ph), you could call it cassino(ph), really. So, I never finished that lunch.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No, I guess not. So you stayed at home.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. <span class="page-break" number="30"></span> Interview with Eugene Chmielowski " January 31, 2015</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you -- okay, did you do any preparations? Did you expect the Germans to arrive at some point?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, we as a military family were given the gas masks, because at that time everybody was expecting the day going to -- to gas, but never happened. So we -- we --we received the masks, those high -- high tech masks that -- because the old ones, you could choke in them. The new ones, they were really comfortable, but we never use them. And later we cut them to pieces because they didn't want Russians to take them over.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. So how do things progress throughout September? What happens?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, September 17", Russians entered Poland. And they were marching. And we -- we lived in that house, and by that house there was a water pump. And as they were marching, this soldier -- I was outside -- came by me. Says, can you give me a cup, because I want to get some water. So to was -- ma -- my first interaction with the -- with the Russians. And he was very, very polite, very nice. So that was probably on the 18" of September.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was Kovel close to the border?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, we're very close. I don't know how many miles, but yes, Kovel was pretty close to the border, Russian there.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Knock on the door, it's three -- three en - NKVD guys enter, and there was one civilian, who sort of sided with Russians. He was a Polish citizen. So they -- we had the big radio. So they took that radio, they say it's no way private person could have a radio like that, it had to belong to the government. And then he -- had the leather -- leather briefcase, they took that one too, and they took him away, and told my mother that he'll be released in -- in couple days, which of course, never happened.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did they say why they were arresting him?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, they arrested all the officers, all the officers --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So, was he expecting this to happen?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, probably. But he had the chance to go to Romania, that -- that was still when the war was on, because the -- the people were going -- from part of the government, they were going through Romania. So they stopped and they say to him, listen, let's go with us, we go to Romania. And my father says no, I got to take <span class="page-break" number="33"></span> Interview with Eugene Chmielowski " January 31, 2015</p><p> care of my wife, and my -- my son, so he didn't go.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you think he fully -- do you think he expected he'd be back in a few days, like they said?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Ah, probably not. My -- my mother went to the NKVD, and says, where are they going to process him, and so forth. And she says, where is the radio? Oh, you'll get it back eventually. Didn't care about the radio, she cared about him.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>

They said, we are going to release him right away, if you're going to give us some information about lot of people in this town.</p><p>And of course my mother turned them down, for two reasons. She was really patriotic. Second is she knew that they were lying. So, she didn't pick up it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How long did this take, when they came to your home, and they banged on the door? Was it a half hour, an hour, sa -- all day?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, at least hour and a half probably. They were searching the house for -- for guns, some reason. Suddenly that's a -- most hour and a half, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember saying goodbye to him?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, he said goodbye to me. And he said, take care of your mother. <span class="page-break" number="34"></span> Interview with Eugene Chmielowski * January 31, 2015</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And so, half an hour, and pack. My mother started arguing with those people, with those NKVDs. Probably Germans would shot her on the spot because she was telling them that Stalin gived his own mother, and so on. And I started to pack, and this NK VD man was helping me packing, because my mother didn't pack.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: She was busy arguing. <span class="page-break" number="35"></span> Interview with Eugene Chmielowski deg January 31, 2015</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Except one thing I couldn't reconcile, because she wrote to us in Russia, a letter, in 1940, in December. She says that she -- she -- she passed the parcel to -- to my father, and at that time, he wasn't there. So evidently those -- those prison officials took the parcel and told her he is there, but I'm sure he wasn't there, because it was December of 1940.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I still want to talk about the journey a little bit. Do you remember leaving Poland? Did people know when they were leaving Poland?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, she had a, I guess, heart condition.

And I didn't think much of it. I mean, I was sorry they arrested him. I didn't think, you know, he'd be killed, but -- but all my life I have everything took in stride, because I figured well, it's not going to help me if I am going to despair and stuff like that. Is going to make things worse. So, I was on the train, doing nothing, like most of the people. They were singing, and so on.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was it that you were trying to keep yourself from being sad?</p></p></dialogue>
