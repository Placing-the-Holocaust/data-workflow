<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How old were you when you started to live in Alshanka(ph)?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: When my parents were hiding. I'm really not very clear about my age, we had no documents, we had nothing, but when we were in Alshanka(ph), I was a few years old. I don't exactly know, a few years old. I know when they were killed I was seven.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But still you waited for them?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, it's very strange what, I don't understand psychologically, yes I waited for them. I mean, strange things remind us. First I waited for them, knowing when they were dead and I also knew the circumstances of their death, but then for the rest of my adult life, not for the rest, until twenty something, I completely eliminated the thought of them ever being there, like I eliminated the fact that I had parents. I don't understand it, maybe that was the way of surviving the trauma.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I need you to help clarify some chronology for me, because I'm a little confused. You were born Kleinfeldt(ph)?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Then when your parents put you into hiding, was it that time that you were adopted by another family 2 <span class="page-break" number="0"></span></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay, so the war ended, people are in the streets, there's a band playing, you're waiting for your parents, did you consciously know at that time, did you have information that they were dead?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yes, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Because you saw it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. Well, like I could hear the sound of the guns and I, on some subconscious level, knew that they were my parents because I had reactions, I suddenly couldn't walk, so that was unusual for a child a few years old, so that was immediate reaction to this, yeah, I knew they were not there any more.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So we're at that day, you're standing and waiting for them to come, do you remember what you were wearing, do you remember what it looked like that day, what it smelled like that day?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: This is after the war, you mean?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm, do you remember that day?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I only remember that the band was playing and everybody was happy, greeting whoever returned and I waited until the whole village already left and I was still waiting and I was very sad. I actually forgot that moment, it just came to me recently, during some activities, that also the band was playing and suddenly the moment came to me.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember what the band was playing?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Something like marches, something of the sort.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were people singing?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, I am sure, yes, it was sort of a happy moment.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you by yourself or were you with other people?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: By myself, the usual. The other people did not really associate with me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You were alone?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, I was usually alone after my parents death.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you were a 10 year old, standing there alone, with all these people celebrating?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Let's see, 10? Probably not 10 yet. But I don't know if you understand what being Jewish was, I mean, that was something like being a cockroach or something, I don't know what to compare it to. These people are very anti-Semitic. So no, I was usually alone. That was nothing different.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How long did you wait there with everybody?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Probably a few hours.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Then what?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And then I went back to my usual, being in the farm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So tell me what, the war is over, you're no longer. . .</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In hiding. Yes, no more in hiding and I was this family, old, sick, uneducated people who This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

I know that to, I mean it was clear that to win her approval was to work, efficiently and I was needed, they were poor people, so I was always working and no playing, really.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What kind of work did you do?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, in the farm, taking care of their cow and finding a pasture for the cow, because they did not have land of their own, so I spent lots of time with the cow alone in the woods. And being eight and later nine or so, preparing food for them when the worked. I had to stand on the stool to reach the stove, I was very small and I stopped growing. So I cooked for them, I cleaned, took care of the little tiny store they had, the grocery, so thats type of work.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: At that time, were you aware of what it meant, that the war was over? Did you know that you were no longer in hiding from that time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, yes. I didn't see any Germans any more and I didn't hide any more, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What did that feel like?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It felt much safer, but I pretty much, I was pretty much used to danger already. I mean each time I saw Germans, I knew this meant a possible death for me, or possible for the people who are saving me, but my life was always in danger, a peasant could kill me, I understood that being Jewish was the worst thing on earth, so I was pretty much used to it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So when you no longer had to feel that way and had to feel like you had to hide who you were, did that open something in you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I really don't know, because I don't think I knew how to be happy, how to celebrate This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

I still was pretty, on the same level, serious-looking kid. I didn't cry, but I didn't laugh either.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you didn't go out to the cow and say to the cow, look we're free, let's run off together?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Probably not. I really didn't, I don't remember being really a child. As far as being a child I only know that I cuddled the cow. That was like feeling she was my mother, probably. But otherwise being pretty serious.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Even when you had the chance to lighten up?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't really remember moments like that. That's why I don't exactly know how to play.</p><p>I was in some retreat, can I digress now? I was in some retreat, people obviously with psychological problem go there and the game was to play like little children. The instruction was go on the floor and play like little children and for a moment I said, I wanted to leave the room and they said, where are you going, and I said, I don't know how to play, I really mean it, so I don't want to spoil it to other people.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What were these people's names?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Rorat.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, these were the Rorats?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, the first family, we didn't talk about it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Did they formerly adopt you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. Rorat, that's how my name became.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When that happened, did you decide at that point you were no longer a Kleinfeldt(ph)?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Actually I was no longer Kleinfeldt(ph) during the war, they changed my name to disguise the Jewishness, so I had some other name, Alshevska(ph), it was the name of the village, so they gave it to me, so I was no longer Kleinfeldt(ph) any way, I was Alshevska(ph), just any name.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So when you were a kid and at that point when you didn't have to hide any more, what was your identity, who did you think you were, who were you for you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: This was difficult, but I don't think I had time, or thought much about it, I mean, with the first family, my only occupation was to keep alive and somehow withstand the abuse. With this family I wanted to be helpful, so I was either working, doing something with them, and then I started going to school, so my life was pretty busy. I don't think I thought much about This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

I don't know what a child does. Maybe this is survival methods.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you identify with being Jewish?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well the people reminded me of this every moment of my life. Not only that I'm Jewish, but that I'm scabby Jewish, it doesn't translate exactly into English, does it? Scabby, lousy, rotten, dirty Jew, all those things. So yes, I did know I was different, I was Jewish.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So at the point that you didn't have to hide this any more, was that at least a feeling for you of, like the equivalent of coming out, of saying okay, yes I'm a Jew and yes that's fine.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I never thought was fine, because nobody else thought it was fine and I did not think it was fine. I actually felt very inferior, very ugly, very inferior.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You were saying that there were efforts made after the war, on different Jewish organizations, what was going on that you were aware of?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I had my sister, not with me, but she was already with Jewish people in Lublin, which is the bigger city and she wrote me that we have an opportunity to leave Poland and possibly go to United States, but I was separated with my sister, we were not close and now her asking me to join her wasn't, it wasn't, I don't know, it didn't mean as much to me as being with this woman who was taking care of me. I didn't want to hurt her feelings and somehow I was not very much concerned with my sister. I knew that she will do all right, she was older than I, stronger and everything and maybe their methods were not the best, the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

They didn't talk to me, I mean, they tried to kidnap me because they knew I don't want to leave, so they either tried to kidnap, or if they contacted me they were saying the worst things about the villagers, so that didn't play with me, so no, so that's why I didn't go. I didn't leave them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How long did you stay in the village with them?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I mean, in their house 13, 14, but later there were no more schools, even to that age, I have to walk several miles to school, there was no school in that little place, but at 14 there was not even enough school in the next, I don't know how you call it, next village and so I had to go to Lublin and then I them very early, so that I was with them <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> Edwarda Rorat 12 February 25, 1996</p><p> Page 12</p><p> was the only Jewish kid in the class and he hated my guts. He absolutely couldn't stand me.</p><p>He was a cruel person altogether, he used to beat up the other children. But I was so good in learning, in behaving, in everything, that he'd no excuse to hit me, there was no excuse and he absolutely couldn't stand a Jewess, so he continuously used to just call me something, it was sarcastic, it was unpleasant and eventually he did hit me. And that was the time I could not be hit any more, that was sort of a saturation point in my life. So I came home and I said I will not go to that school again, that's why I had to march several miles to another school, rather than going to this one. So it was pretty difficult for a few years old child to go through school and forest, not a single person there. I had to leave early, before sunrise, I mean it was dark and go by myself. There were wild animals around and walk, so I wasn't easy.</p><p>And then after school, the same thing, walking several miles by myself, but the good thought was that studying always came very easy to me compared to the other children that it did feel good to be a good student and my adoptive parents were very proud of me. But that again, it really, nothing was ever simple. When I was too good there, the children were jealous and they also could call me, oh she's so good because she's Jewish and almost being the best student was almost like an insult that that's because Jews, you know, they are so manipulative and so shrewd and whatever. They turn it in . The teachers like me, but <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> Edwarda Rorat 13 February 25, 1996 Page 13 they felt I have to be educated. They believe in that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What about the parents of the other children, was there any resentment by them?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I really don't know. The other children had hard time learning. I suppose because of my background I had it easier, my parents were educated and that probably was in my genes. So I had it real easy, I was delayed with my schooling because of the war and the way I was catching up, I was practically flying through those classes. So that's why I could finish really on time, otherwise it wouldn't have been possible.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I want you to help me get a picture, and actual, so I can make a little movie</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> and describe, what kinds of trees were in the woods, did you walk <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Edwarda Rorat 14 February 25, 1996 Page 14 when I carry some food with me, I gave it to dogs and they ate it and then I felt safe with them. And in the winter it was deep snow, sometimes up to my shoulders or more, I have to part the snow with my arms. In summer it was not too bad, I walked bare feet and I loved the blue sky and lots of poppies, you know the red flowers? They grow there in abundance in fields. And the birds were singing so I think this is my love of nature. Did I describe my walks?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Sounds like a really nice part of your day.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was after the war of course, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And then you would get to the school, what did the school look like, was it a wooden building or what?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, the school, when I walked several miles to this other place, this was already better place than my school in my village. It was a small room, nothing really special. I particularly like classes of religion. The priest was giving them and he was teaching of all those miracles that happen in Catholic religion. Of course I was educated and brought up actually in Catholic experience, so I was learning this. Of all the miracles that happen in Catholicism and I suppose this was pleasant to me. Maybe I thought that miracles will happen to me too, I don't know. And I was reading all the books on the subject. So actually this is my most pleasant thought, the priest. He was not anti-Semitic, at least didn't let me feel it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you feel any conflict between, being brought up as a Jew that you were not to This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: A conflict within myself? No, I was very curious to learn this Catholic religion, it was very soothing to me, I like the miracles and as I told to you, I eliminated the thought of my parents from my mind and I did not remember if my parents were religious or not, I don't remember any of that. So I was trying to learn what I was taught.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you pray for a miracle?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I sort of did, yes, I remember at one time I was such a good girl that it was my way to be loved by these people and I was so much in a hurry to prepare for them the meal when they were returning from working hard in the field. I wanted to cook for them and I lost the key and I thought, if I don't find that key, how will I cook for them, that thought was unbearable.</p><p>I just didn't know what to do, that I behaved in such a way that I win them. I don't know if I prayed for it. I really don't remember praying, don't forget that I was brought up Catholic and then I was educated in my very sensitive years as a Communist, so when I think of it now, it all get little blurred and confused and then I came to this Capitalistic country and became a doctor, so altogether nothing goes together really.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay, you're in this Catholic school, you're praying for a miracle of the finding of the key.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>The key gets found, you know there's some validity to this thing.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yes, yes, yes, yes. But I really don't, I must tell you I don't dwell much on my past life. Actually I pretty much avoided talking about myself altogether, so by not talking about it I guess I don't remember how I, did I pray? No, all I wanted, not to be called a dirty, lousy This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did that happen? Did people stop calling you that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I was moving on to better school, then eventually went into Lublin, so no, yeah, they did stop calling me openly that, that changed, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How many people lived in the village that you were in?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Even that hard for me to tell now, maybe 50? It was a very small place and they had their children and so on, but it was very tiny village.</p></p></dialogue>

But he and his daughter who mostly, whom I mostly remember as the worst person on earth, hated me with passion, and all my complexes really I think, date from that period. Her name was Wanda. She was very unattractive and they called her spinster those days. And most of the time I spent with her, they asked me to do the work of adult person, like bringing water from the river uphill, carrying it, I was this skinny, undernourished, seven year old kid carrying water, I spilled it most often, probably. Washed dishes, and taking care of cows, cleaning and they didn't even give me food, I remember eating the water where you wash the dishes, I found out this __, you know. So the water that the dishes and pots were washed, that's what I was eating. I had no room to sleep, I slept on the floor and very soon I was infested with the lice and fleas and any possible thing. Mostly lice, they were crawling all over me, so yeah, I was covered with scabs and I was ugly and skinny and everything and she was very cruel. She always threatened me with the knife and I do have many knife scars from her, that was the way to talk to the Jewess was the knife poking.</p></p></dialogue>

So I don't think that's so unusual, but the unusual thing is that he, I recall later Mr. Rorat was telling to Mrs. Rorat, you know, there were about 20 geese on top of her, hitting her and biting, and that noise and after I scared them all her face was dry, not even one tear. So they find it very strange and I find it strange too, but I knew, I mean I do remember I never cry, there was no, why to cry, there was no one to dry my tears, so I didn't cry and I didn't laugh either.</p></p></dialogue>

And then later I learned that, I learned crying yeah, it's pretty nice to cry. I only cry when I talk about my past, these days and since I rarely talk about myself, about the past, I rarely cry, unless situation like speaking with you on the subject or on some psychologically oriented retreats that I started frequenting, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When did you start doing that?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't know, I mean maybe I was going through some sort of, I wouldn't call it crisis, but maybe aging, so I became interested in Eastern philosophy. I said that's the only one missing, let's see, I was born Jewish, I was brought up Catholic, educated Communist, then came to this Capitalistic country, so somehow eastern philosophy was needed to bring me back to some sort of tranquillity I guess. So that's the retreat I found, which was run by the guru.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, because I'm very well controlled and since there are other people in the movies, I wouldn't allow myself. I am very good at controlling myself, I'm very good at denying myself anything that I feel I should. Let's see what else I'm good at. Not getting attached to anyone, whom I like in particular.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: This is, this is, really, this moment I also recall by being in this retreat, they had those different eastern tricks, I shouldn't call it that way, that you meditate and sort of empty your mind and that's why the memories might come and that's how it happened, that this moment came to me, that I did know I have to go to school because I would not disappoint my foster parents and I don't know how she was planning to do this. We did need the money, so here I'm in the school and I don't know how it came to me that I had this courage, determination or what, I went to the, I went to see the, how do you call the person who's really in charge of the whole school, the principal, principal. And I do remember entering his office, since I was very tiny, as I told you I wasn't growing. I remember his desk seemed so huge that when I think of his desk it almost seems like a skyscraper in New York to me now, it was so huge and since I was so small I only could see the desk, I couldn't even see his face, he was sitting behind it and he must have a hard time seeing me also, because I remember he stood up from his desk and looked down at me and ask what I want, I mean probably children never go to see principal, I somehow made my way to his office and there I am. So he ask what I want and I told him I need to be in this school, I have to get the education, but my foster parents have no money. He said, but this is private school and I said I really don't know what I can do but I don't have money and I suppose he must have been touched somehow that he allowed me to stay in that school, not only stay in the school, but also in the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you also good in that, a good student there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, excellent.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What subjects were you really good at?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In everything, in everything, you know, this was my way to, I know this was my way to win the approval, the same, anything I do, I work very hard to win approval and I knew that teachers like you very much if you learn what they were teaching. So I did. I study hard and I was always best in class so the teachers love me, yes. That was my Catholic school in Lublin. I have some sad thoughts from this, however. I could see my difference. This was private Catholic school. The children were sort of well off, nicely dressed. They were receiving visitors, their families and I never had visitors, it was too expensive and too long trip for my foster parents to visit. So I had no visitors, I had no nice clothes. So I guess I was, started understanding a little more so this was rather sad for me. That's my Lublin Catholic years.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You still seem sad to me.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't really remember, because this was such a different environment.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Crutches?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Crutches, yes. So yes I was friends with her, she had a very nice family. I don't remember why she was crippled. I think something congenital. Yes, so I was friends with her. So you ready for the Communist?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I'm interested what it was like to have a friend, friendly?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Honestly it was much nicer, but I wasn't really like everybody else, I learned to be secretive, I had to be secretive during the war, not to talk about myself, be extremely careful, that I am now one of the farmer's children, had to pretend to strangers and of course if German would come to class. That I became, I just was secretive. You cannot be that friendly when you're closed in and I suppose that's where my custom is, from those years that Lask other people to talk about themselves and I do not talk about me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But it was a time, it was after the end of the war, you didn't have to be secretive any more.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, but this became a custom, this became me, not to trust, not to say something that I shouldn't have say. And this perpetuates.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay, the Communists came along. Well tell me how you went from the one school to This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Imean the way it happened is that, in this part of Poland, this is closer to the mountain, I suppose there was not much iodine and my thyroid started growing. That's all what I needed, having these things growing in front of me and the doctor in school said, I have to be near the sea, that's the Baltic Sea, Polish, that's the north and there was no way I could afford to go anywhere, any place and strangely enough, this was the time I received letter from Stettin, which is near the Baltic Sea, the north, from some very distant cousin from my real parents. Distant cousin, though. She survived the war and found out that I was alive and that's what they did, she wrote me a letter, would I like to visit her in Stettin? So, to make long story short, I did take a long trip by train across Poland from Lublin to Stettin, with a little trepidation because I knew she was Jewish and I had very strange feelings about the Jewish people by now. I acquire anti-Semitism by osmosis or by whatever. I have never seen nice looking Jews during the war, I only saw then in hiding, with beards, smelling and wearing awful clothes and of course being reminded that being Jewish is the worst thing that can happen to anyone. So I had this strange feeling so I am going to feel about meeting her.</p><p>And then I did meet her, it was nice in some way and difficult in others and her husband was a true Communist, they put me in the Communist school. So from now on I was in the Communist school.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You said you had trepidation about meeting these people, you didn't feel good about Jews, you were anti-Semitic and so forth, so when you did meet them, what was your feeling This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

I have seen during the war that the Jews that were killed had these papers with them. So this was the difficult part.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you feel any recognition of part of yourself?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. Also my upbringing was different, I grew up in the village in poverty that you can not imagine and they were older, I was by then probably 16. I don't know their age, they sort of look old. They survived in Siberia the war. So now the Communist indoctrination started in school.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Where was your sister during all this time?</p></p></dialogue>

I was brought up by cow, I mean. The way she spoke, this was someone with education and mannerism and so on, so that part I admire, she spoke beautifully and knew literature and art and times before the was, so from that is was different for me, yes, but I did miss my adopted peasants and eventually I brought them to Stettin and I just moved, living with them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You lived with the Rorats, in Stettin?</p></p></dialogue>

They didn't and something didn't work and the whole thing was so ridiculous, how could it possibly be something suspicious when I was six or seven at the time of that, how could I? So then I became angry because I do have my temper when I let it and I said, all right, I collaborated, and that really finish it, but they were upset with me that this was the arrogant way of me to answer and it really aggravated me so that's what I remember, that for a long time I had to hide that I am actually Jewish. As a peasant it was much better for me, but eventually this come out, I mean they find out my Jewish cousins, oh blah, blah, so I had to tell the truth, that I am Jewish and I was not killed, I don't know why, but it really was at times very difficult with the Communism, I had a very bad influence at home because my cousin was not Communist, her husband was, she was not and neither were my peasants, Rorat, so I had that influence at home and hear the propaganda at school, so I really, I had problems with that and then since I was the best student, I of course had to be in the forefront of the organization and everything and they ask me to report on other kids from the class, to report if they have family in America or maybe or so, oh I have to also hide that I had sister in America so that .

I always follow what I was told and I was actually hoping that I will not pass the competitive exam. But I did pass competitive exam. And then I was hoping, maybe they will not accept me because then the Communists have to approve you, if you're good or not, after I pass the competitive exam, then I have to face the board of Communists. And I was hoping maybe then I flunk and I almost did, almost did. Because they ask some questions about the political system and something, it was give and take. And I did answer truthfully, almost every, not almost, practically everybody was disappointed with Communism and so was I, but you don't say it to them, right, if you want to be admitted to medical school or to anywhere, but I told the truth and they were absolutely shocked because no one who has any brain would do this. I remember they were sort of bored with interviewing and here I come and they all lifted their head and I do remember they ask if it is the Communist organization that taught me that honesty. You see, they were, and they were sure I would say yes, that I learned this in Communist organization, but no I didn't give them the satisfaction. I said no, I learn it from my foster parents, that I always have to be truthful and that was the end of interview and there were several other students sent in there and after we left they say, okay good-bye Edwarda, they will never take you to medical school, how can you answer in such a truthful way, that's not the way to do it. But they were impressed with my frankness and this actually they need, they always wanted to have good students in the Communist organization and they did try to recruit somebody like me, so yeah, they did take me, in spite</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was very difficult for me at the beginning because the first year or so in Polish medical school is a lot of the basic sciences and also seeing the cadavers and doing autopsy on them and I could not tolerate this.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no, it's such a part of me, it's so ingrained in me that I have to be accepted that I couldn't scream because the neighbors wouldn't accept it, remember? I have neighbors, very acoustic apartments, no, so I couldn't do that. That's from my childhood, I have to be accepted.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay, so we're in medical school, Communist medical school, whatever that may mean, I have no idea.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, well like it was very difficult to study, it's a very demanding, very demanding and I of course had to be on scholarship, otherwise I had no means of supporting myself. There were no jobs like here students can get jobs, there were no such thing. So I had to behave in the Communist organization and always have to be best student, so that's very difficult. I had to really study, otherwise I would lose scholarship.</p></p></dialogue>

And what else. I mean they did ask me to give something back for the scholarship, I have to do something for the system. And what I choose was to teach in lower classes, being a teacher, or teach illiterates, I was very good at that because I did teach my foster mother how to read and write, she was illiterate. I taught her that in her old age, so I was already good at that, so I now I was teaching illiterates to give back something to the Communist system. So I was either teaching in classes or teaching illiterates or going to help with the removing the bricks and ruins wherever it needs, area of the city needs to be cleaned, they didn't have enough workers, they wanted students to help and of course they want who got scholarship. So I would go to try to remove the bricks and all the debris that was there. Or at the time of, how do you call, when the wheat is grown, when the peasants harvest, the time of harvest I would go to the villages to help. Also at the time when potatoes are ready, I don't know how that is called, that the farmers needed help. So that's what I would do.</p></p></dialogue>

That's where we lived, in a basement apartment, the basement was pretty nice, so I lived with them. They had the apartment and some little salary.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: This was in the, in what years?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In Stettin, I finished medical school in "59, so this was in the fifties.</p></p></dialogue>

She had a terrible marriage and she didn't believe in marriages and nobody was good enough for me and he was 10 years older and divorced and she hated his guts, so we started having problems, yes.</p></p></dialogue>

When I developed and this would be another chapter, another book maybe, so I skipped that and just told you, this is the circumstances that I did, met that man who was probably for me or maybe not. I married him, but I never stay in relationships so I didn't stay in this one either.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But I'm interested in that process of, becoming a woman is becoming aware in a very definite way, you become aware of your body, you become aware of other people's reaction to you, it changes everything.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And because you were older when this happened, I would think you would be more intellectually able to look at what was happening and reflect on that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I had very difficult time to become mature and all that, I wasn't prepared for this, I mean my foster parents she never talked to me about what it is to be a woman, what it is about men and I wasn't prepared for any of this, how you relate to men and don't forget, in my important years I was a Catholic, so that's against sex, sex is dirty. So that was pretty tough for me, that period. And it didn't much help that I was raped first time when I was a virgin, so that didn't really help in my development.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Not when it happened, because it happened in the woods.

He was, he had a hot temper and I don't think he was best in psychology and also he really didn't know much about me because remember, I don't talk about myself.

I had no concept of it and especially that suddenly I was recognized as attractive. I was the only one, or very few who was dark hair and dark eyes and now that I developed, oh well they start noticing me and he couldn't deal with it, he was extremely jealous over me and continuously would fight about it and I couldn't deal with him accusing me of something. I mean I have no interest with other men and I felt he was accusing me continuously, we were having fights, we were breaking up, it was so difficult for me, because here, for the first time here, I love somebody, it's a wonderful feeling and especially the way he was loving, only Slavs know how, I mean showering with these words, with affection, with being there all the time, I can't describe it. And of course I was drawn into this and then we would have terrible fights. Somebody would look at me and he thought I looked at them too, and we just had fights so it was very difficult for me, it was hard to be with him and it was impossible to be without him, so there.</p></p></dialogue>

So he, one day he said let's go for a ride as we sometimes did and he took me to city hall, arrived there and he said let's get married and I said okay and I called my best woman friend from medical school to be a witness and my foster father, so there we were, we're not even specially dressed and we went to a restaurant for dinner after that, that was it.</p></p></dialogue>

So that changed and I received letter from my sister saying, you know law is changed now and we are the only two sisters and I would like to invite you to come to this country and that took many years, so that was before I met my future husband and although I had a little hard time with it, don't forget I was brainwashed against America, this was the rotten Imperialism, the worst system in the world, corrupted. That's from every point of view and the way they were, just brainwashed us, showing this funny Americans, all they like to do it chew gums and what else was it, and drink Coke. Later on Polish people are drinking Coke too, but at that time it was funny and ridiculous, chewing gum and drinking Coke, no culture or nothing and I had no interest in going to place like that you know, so my sister was a stranger. So I really did not have interest but my cousin Barbara and other people who were really not so devoted Communists, said don't listen to all this, you have only one sister, you should play along, you go there and if you don't like it, you come back, so that's what I started doing.</p></p></dialogue>

Apparently you can prolong it for some time, but not forever, so when I married, around the time I was going to marry my husband, my passport and my visa was not going to be prolonged any more. I was prolonging so long, that I think my passport expire when I was on the trip, you know, during the trip to States. So obviously couldn't prolong any more, so there, that's how the trip to United State came along. My sister paid for a trip, I thought that it was round trip. That's how I parted with my husband. It was very hard for me to leave him behind. I thought my heart will break, how I missed him when I came here. I couldn't stand the separation. Only later I understood that I cannot stand any separation with any person that I care for and for him this was such a deep love I felt that that separation almost killed me, I couldn't stand it, I wanted immediately to return to Poland, but my sister would not pay the trip. She didn't have any money, neither did I. So I could not return.</p></p></dialogue>

So I went to that hospital and walked to the superintendent <span class="page-break" number="47"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Edwarda Rorat 52 February 25, 1996 Page 52 totally and completely lost. And then I was, as you remember I went there because I want to earn money and return to Poland and then I found out how little they pay because I get room and board. The salary was so little that it would take long time to earn that money. Anyway I was saving everything and eventually I had enough to return to Poland so I went to the superintendent and I say I want to leave and he said oh, you signed the contract, you cannot leave. At that time I didn't know I could sue, I could do, I didn't even know about lawyers existed, in Poland nobody sue anybody that I know of. I didn't have money for such things, so I had to stay longer. And so on, so the time went by and I did not return.</p></p></dialogue>

Most people didn't believe in, so he didn't take it seriously. And no one ever questioned me about anything here. In the hospital all they needed was the working body, that's all they were interested.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Extremely, I mean because it was such hard work, day and night and what I learned in medical school was, I mean while we stay in medical school was clearly helping patients and it was almost, I mean we were indoctrinated by the patient is everything. It wasn't for money, there wasn't any money in Poland, medicine or no medicine there was no money, so it wasn't for money, it was not prestigious, anybody, everybody in Poland work and since medicine didn't have any money, then somehow nobody thought much of being physician or This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

So here I am in the city hospital and if I tell you one example you will understand my awakening to reality and different reality than I was prepared to, okay? Here I am working at night as I told you, unable to cope with all those patients and I'm only one, but anyway I quickly develop system that I will tend to the one who is dying and somehow the rest will take care of itself, so here it is, one patient dying, I have to give him intravenous infusion and while he's already in shock, his veins are collapse, it's difficult to find it, eventually I found the vein, the infusion is going, I'm very happy, I did what I need to do, but now I have to go to see other patients, so I told one nurse, don't do anything on the floor, just keep around him in case infusion is not going or when it is over, since I didn't know when I would be back, just stay by him, watch this infusion going and when it's finished, change the bottle or call me, don't do anything else, anything that I write any orders, I do myself, stay here. She said all right. She was a minority nurse. And I went to take care of other patients and I return, I don't know after how long, maybe half an hour, maybe longer. The bottle is empty by now, the infusion is finished long time ago, by now the air is in it, she's nowhere to be found until I open the bathroom, she's sitting in the bathroom and reading newspaper and smoking cigarettes. And the patient is dead of course.</p><p>The infusion stopped, he was in shock, he's dead, she never changes and this infuriated me so much that I grabbed this empty bottle and I threw it at her, but I missed, I missed her head and I told her she's dismissed, she must leave the floor, so she did. Of course I said it with anger. So next day superintendent calls me, that's not the one who hire me, this was different</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

I said yes. And he said, you have to apologize to her. And I said, I'm not going to. So he said, if you don't apologize, then you are going to be fired because I have enough interns, but we don't have enough nurses. So that was the awakening, okay? That was a rude awakening, he said he doesn't care that the patient died. It was clear. Well he didn't fire me because there was opposition by other doctors that I'm such a good intern and so on, but that among other things was awakening what medicine is like and what life is.</p></p></dialogue>

I didn't like the initial encounter, I told you, the cadavers and the basic sciences, but that was only the beginning.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I mean, toward the end of this I found out somebody was helping me, a doctor, a sort of, anonymously he was helping me. At night he would take my night calls without me knowing. Was helping me a lot instead of helping me also openly and so on, he was a Yugoslav man, a doctor there, ahead of me or something. And before you know he told me he loves me. Of course, let's see, oh I was hiding that I was married because I was brought up that every man likes to fool around with married woman, that's how it was in Poland, that was the time of virginity, so of course the virgin woman would not fool around, but married This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And he was helping me around, this is from Slavic country, familiar, we could communicate a little more in our language, which was easier for me than English and he was pretty unhappy here himself, was hard for him.</p><p>So we became closer and closer, he told me he loves me and one day, before much thinking about it, we did become intimate and that was really very shocking to me, that it wasn't really that much different than with my husband, because he always told me that what we do and this is so special, it's only between us, with no other men you would ever feel that and it's only, I mean I can't say it in English, I was really, don't forget, I was a Catholic and I didn't know anything about these things. He told me this is between us and forever and here it is, it's not so much different with this man and this man is like an angel to me, helping me, he doesn't fight with me, he seems so good. So I start doubting, suddenly start doubting, I had no one to discuss these things with. I start doubting if my relationship, which is so difficult, if it is so special. And being really stupid, I wrote my husband that I betrayed him, that was the word, if you have sex with somebody else, that's betrayal. As you know, I was always straightforward and I remained that way. I didn't know I don't supposed to tell him. So I wrote him that and then I didn't think there was a way he could forgive me and probably he couldn't so he has really, he had the nervous breakdown at that. I mean Polish people are different than what you know here and the time changed now, who gets a nervous breakdown over a woman now, a woman doesn't mean much, does it? So, he did get the nervous breakdown and then they let every postpone, he ended up in the institution for a</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And I thought there was no way back after what I told him, so I didn't return.</p><p>And of course, quite soon after I find out, I don't love this man. But then I never stayed in any relationship in my life and after I find out, I don't love this man. But then I never stayed in any relationship in my life, so sooner I was in with this one.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you in contact with your husband after that point?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was writing to him later that he absolutely should divorce me, he deserves better and I beg him to marry somebody else. I really meant it, I feel very guilty, I feel very bad and eventually he did marry someone who looks just like me. So I don't know, that's that part.</p></p></dialogue>

As I understand now, she went to the union, you know, they had problems on, so he didn't want me as a resident and that's just wonderful. This was one of the hospital that later became the worst, the absolute worst, it wasn't then yet, then, so I had to look for another one and that man friend, the Yugoslav helped me to find another, which was much nicer and I had to take exams, I need time to study, so I couldn't select any This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

That was one of the reasons, so I didn't go with him, but I didn't like to stay, he left and this hospital was on the list to be closed, so I thought I should do something and then I received telephone call from Beth Israel Hospital, because my reputation already spread, how good I was, so I received call from Beth Israel, without me looking for it, would I like to come for interview because they would like to hire me. So I went for interview, didn't check anything about director, about the place, about the salary, about my title, just jumped into because I needed a place, so that's how I moved to Beth Israel and that's how I moved to the city.

I think that's what it is, why would I otherwise be so afraid of being hurt. I'm very independent, that's the positive part, I can count on myself, I can be alone anywhere, I can travel alone, I can go to restaurants alone, I don't mind being alone, that is independence. I went as far in my field as one could. I could go higher, like trying to become director, but I never wanted that last stop, either being afraid of so-called success or I don't really like being in position of such politics and power ands so on, I don't need it. But also something prevents me from that, I think knowing that I'm not politician enough. I actually like diagnosing, I don't like politics. Happy, I know that my personal life leaves much to be wished for or desired, but I did find out that relationship doesn't work for me. It brings me as much happiness as there is, but also as much suffering. So it almost like comes to neutral, right? That I stop thinking about it, I stop looking for it, so it's like a fact that I cannot have relationship. It's just something that I didn't learn to be and I had no relationship in my childhood and later. I don't know how to be in it. I get so easily hurt.

I become clinging, I become possessive, even if I don't show, the partner feels it. And I did hear it on more than one occasion that I smother him. | think my clinging, my insecurity in that is so obvious that the partner can't take it, or there are no such people who would understand, get along with this, so it, I'm always afraid they leave me and if they don't leave me I leave them, I don't know, it's just the relationship I find difficult. It's the happiest moment for me and it's also the toughest and so without a relationship, life is not full. When I work it seems it's completely full, my work is so demanding and I give so much out of myself that during the day I never know, once I get there nothing exists, no private life, no nothing, I'm so involved.

No, about my being Jewish, still had mixed feelings about that, I did not find Jewish men attractive. Jewish people. So that made it easy not to socialize with them, right? And I didn't. Then I did, eventually I did and then sort of like coming around again I socialize more with European background. I find that I know more what I'm dealing with. If they tell me something I can see if they mean it, if they don't, I had very hard time with American hypocrisy, I come from different culture. There, if people like you they tell you, if they didn't like you they didn't say they do. They never say I like to see you if they didn't mean it. So here I come to the socializing and the people say oh it was great meeting you and I like to see you again, I was taking this exactly as that, I waited for them to call, they never did and all these disappointments, I couldn't understand the hypocrisy, I found it very difficult, so that's what I call my American period. I would say it was super, I found it superficial, the link with the American people. So I think now, if I think of my closest friends, they are European and some are Jews with similar background as I have, I find that wonderful. Actually my last relationship was with a Jewish man, who also had the, well, had some background during the war but his both parents lived and he really didn't have much hardship except he understood what it means to be a Jew and confronted with anti-Semitism and so on. I find that this was so great for me, something in common. But that ended, as all my other relationship.

If I like women very much, if this is close relationship, I start being possessive also the way I am for men. I think it's again the fear that they leave me.

I say no, but I can pay now. He said no, it's too late, you cannot come in, and just closed the door in front of my nose. That's now how I imagined the, any how do you say, a synagogue or church or any praying place. I find that very disappointing. And I gave it another chance, I went to synagogue again and I am very disciplined person, very organized, I am well behaved and I have certain concept of how the place of prayer looks like. I was seeing the Catholics remember, when they play the music or the priest is having ceremony and people are quietly sitting and listening and praying, so here I'm in synagogue, everybody's talking around and laughing and I don't know, I find it very disorganized, I didn't like the way it looked, you see, I didn't grow up in that spirit. And the prayer is in the language I don't understand, so all together I feel Jewish in some point. Feel Jewish, whatever that means, but the religion I don't.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh that, of course I do, yes, yes. I'm actually touched reading the book, when you read during holiday, it tells you about Jewish past and all the suffering. I'm deeply touched by that, yes. But I will never be able to really disperse it any more, that's for sure. I do feel Jewish, which is a big step for me.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: How did that happen, oh I think Communism ended it, because ended, I mean being religious in a communist, that's a laughable matter, it just doesn't exist.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I'm attracted to this Buddhism or I don't really know the religion but I notice the acceptance of everybody, I mean in this retreat that the guru was conducting, it's believing in yourself more, not in any god that I always had hard time to imagine where is her, where was he with all that suffering was happening? I couldn't believe it at that time, where was God?</p><p>As a child I felt that, I really did feel cheated that he's not protecting me. So in this retreat, it's more like believing in yourself and loving human being, trusting yourself. I mean, it's the same wisdom, not hurting anyone right, not hurting yourself.

I find it that it was the best religion during the Christmas they have Christmas tree and they have Hanukkah candles and any other religion that you want to observe. But this is for my recreation, during the daily life I don't have time for any religion. It seems my religion is the work I guess, I'm totally absorbed in it. This gave me, I think, it's satisfying that I'm okay. That part is satisfying.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When you say that you're not in relationships for long, it seems that you weren't in any kind of relationship for long.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Correct, yes. It's just they didn't last for me. I think it must be combination of factors, one of them is that I am independent, I know that I can live without relationship. I can live on my own and since I am so adept at denying myself anything, I can deny myself even happiness that you find through intimacy and love in relationship with a man. I tried, it didn't work for me and at this point I certainly am not going to go searching for the man, for the person, right?</p></p></dialogue>

I really felt tormented many times. Now I know better how to deal with the torment, that because I learned methods that the nature put me back in the best of moods so I seek that when I'm down.

No point of getting attached, right, they leave me, so I have no dogs, no. But I know more how to deal with the torment that I may feel.

When I first moved here, there were less building, but eventually became crowded, yes. I never thought I would be living in the big city. I don't think I belong here, that's not what I like, but I don't think I'm going to make any more changes in my life, I need some sort of something familiar, something that keeps me grounded and I started here and I stay here.

Like I always thought I should have a house in the country because I love the country and so on, but then you know I had ideas about it would be even more work for me, I don't like being alone in the house and so on, but it was always in the back of my mind, why don't I have a house. So when I discover that retreat, | suddenly had the place in the country and I had friends and that guru, that guru was, I can't begin to tell you. Better than any gods that I believed in because Stalin was also god for me when I was growing up, the educate, I believed he was a god. So this was the best of gods. He was so charismatic and such a, so much wisdom and he also came from a very poor background in India, he was the poorest, he didn't have shoes. So he had that sort of some wisdom that I could identify with very well. And his teaching was not to have too many possessions because then they possess you and many of the things really rang the truth to me and it was just great.

It wasn't an empty level, how are you, fine and I'm fine and you don't really want to know how I am and what's my problem, nothing, this is how we communicate in the big city. Over there the communication was one person listen and the other talks. And really talks, about the issues, the problems that the most secretive, the most, the ideas, the thoughts that we most attach, be completely open, not being afraid that you will be judged, it would be used against you. It was just incredible and then that person stops and listen what the other one says. That, I call communication. So it really helped me a lot, a lot. And then he was ousted last year.

And so there, and I really don't like much dwelling on the past because nothing I can do about that and I just hope that this interview help somebody. I know how people who never lived through the war have no idea what's important and how they don't handle the real emergencies well and I must say I feel very proud of myself how well I handle emergencies.</p><p>It seems I handle emergencies better than I handle peaceful times. I'm not maybe used to much of that. The people who never had to really, they didn't live through poverty, they didn't live through the war, they didn't live through tragedy, they're so attached to their little things, their chocolate they didn't have or it starts snowing, they don't have right clothes, I mean the smallest thing, they actually fall apart.

That now I would like something in return. Through my life I was always giver, giver, giver, giver, I must say that that changed lately, I would like this to be at least both ways. Where were we? Oh yes, helping. It's just work and giving, giving, giving. Do you know that I will never know how to ask about my salary, or increase or my needs of vacation or anything. I don't know how to do this and if it's not given to me, I'm very disappointed. I think one should be recognize and this should be part of it and I find life is not like that. So if I'm not given increase, I will not ask for it. I will never ask for vacation when I want it, I only take it when nobody else wants it. I will say this is a giver. That's how it is at work. But I also do count my blessings, I'm in perfect health. I never had to take any drugs or alcohol or any other addictions. I manage without, the way I manage. So those are the blessings. I suppose my profession is too. It is a very interesting and gratifying profession. And I being in this country counts too, I certainly don't like what's happening in Poland, I mean the way of this persecution</p><p> during the war.

I did have chance to punish them after the war, the father of Wanda was tried, he was in jail, he was found that he killed some Jewish people and she probably didn't kill, she was the woman, but she certainly was cruel to me and I could have hurt them if I testify that I remember something of them killing Jews and you know I could not. I went to jail and I saw him old and lost weight and looked so miserable and I just, I don't know, I just could not bring myself to say anything against him, so I didn't and the years, so that helped him that I did not testify against him.

My sister did not want them to know about the war, about our experiences, she wanted them to be normal American children and this really didn't always work, because it wasn't easy to be her child, as I found out.
