We played ball, we went to the dunes, we went swimming and then he was in my class for several years and then he was transferred to another school. He wasn't entirely a good student and couldn't stay in our school. But I stayed very friendly with him. Actually "til he was arrested also in a raid. Again a reprisal raid in July deg42, just before the deportation started. Also a German soldier had been killed and they emptied that whole street of all the Jews. One very long street, very nice residential street, went in every home where there were Jews and arrested them.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember any in particular, or anything like that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, we listened a lot to French songs, like Charles Trunet (?) You probably don't even know that name. He was very popular then, and also Austrian songs like Marta Keller, I think that was her name. No, that was not her name. We listened to American songs. Frank Sinatra was big. We played a lot of classical records. We had an old fashioned player. For his Bar Mitzvah he got a record player, you know, that you turned a handle to play, and we played a lot of classical music. What else? I don't know. We did what young people do. We went on trips, bike trips and stuff like that. He was caught in one of those raids and that was the end of him.</p><p>The day after he was arrested, he was sent on o Auschwitz or wherever. I never heard from him. With his parents and his brother. I even went in a day or two after because I worked for the Jewish Council in that department that was called Aids to Departing People and I was able to send some stuff to Westerbork because most people stayed. But later on I heard they weren't even there. And, of course, he never came back. And I didn't know that at the time during all those years, all of the sudden he might be back. He was young and everything, of course we realized that he probably didn't live three days afterwards.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What month was that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: It was June 1942 and it was just after his birthday. It was a Sunday. And I am trying to look back, his birthday was on June 4, 1942 and whatever the Sunday was after that; I think it was June 9", it was that date. He had just turned 20. He had a younger brother who was very, very bright and very, very musical, was about three or four years younger than him. Of course, he went, his parents, everybody. And then, after that I had some sort of a boyfriend, his name was Hans Rudelshim, and he was born in Kampen, which was near 5 I <span class="page-break" number="0"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Do you know what year Hans was born?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think probably also in 1922, it may have been "21.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was Rudi like?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Rudi was a very nice down to earth, rather simple kind of guy, I think. You don't know. I sometimes wonder what would he have been or become. He was as I said he didn't have very good head for learning, but his father was a stockbroker and I think he could have become that too. He was interested in business and everything. But there wasn't much time for development yet. You know, we were both 16 when the war broke out in Europe and 17 when Holland was invaded. We were kids. I mean even today 16 and 17 years old, and they are much more sophisticated than we were, but even they are little kids, while they know more of what goes on in the world, you know, with television. We didn't have television, of course. We didn't have a radio in the house until I was 14. If 1 wanted to hear children's programs on the radio, I walked 25 minutes to my grandmother's every Tuesday afternoon to hear children's programs. We were not really spoiled kids. It wasn't that much.</p></p></dialogue>
