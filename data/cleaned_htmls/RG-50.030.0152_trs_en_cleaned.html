And so therefore it was shortened to Meed, the first four letters of my name.</p><p>I also was known during...in the underground as . And therefore many people who remember me from the first years of liberation and the underground call me Czeslaw. But actually mine...I was born under the name of Benjamin.</p></p></dialogue>

I was born in Warsaw and...uh...the city where I lived, in the apartment...I...in those days people were giving...were born mostly in the homes and I was one of those from that generation...was born in the same house where I lived, probably until the end of the ghetto.

We belong also to the sport clubs and...uh...the school left on me a tremendous mark on my life. Uh...All my teachers were of my idols. I was very lucky with teachers. I... think and some other kids thought that way about their teachers that we had the best teachers in the world. They really cared for us and they taught us, and I have a lot of respect for the teachers. Uh... The teacher played a very important role in my life, and...uh...to some extent...uh...even mine parents became jealous. Why do I listen so much to the teachers and...uh...not paying enough attention for...for our rules for generations were established in my family and...uh...the main rules were...the...we call it in Yiddish... . that means respect for the parents <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A:I came from a very...all Jewish families were large. I came from a family which was for generations living in the same city in Warsaw. My grandfather which was great grandfather which was well known in the...in Warsaw, had a laundry business, and his name was . It was a very well known laundry. He had 18 children and...uh...1 don't remember now the names of all the children, but I was a youngster coming to the...for all the holidays to my great grandfather and I remembered big table. It's like a...like a hole. There were three rooms which were opened the walls in order to accommodate all the people, and we sat at the table. My grand great father had, as I said, had 18 children. My grandfather had 9 children, and I come from a family of 4. I don't know if the calculation is correct, but I think we were between 300 to 400 people of one family in Warsaw under the same name.</p><p>. And it was a Hasidic family, all belonging to the Hasidic sect of the Alexander Rabbi. We all...uh...assembled...uh...on Saturdays, especially on Saturdays. We came to the same synagogue and on holiday, we definitely made sure that we are in one the same place. Even people which were out of town had to come back and to be in the same synagogue praying together. That I think it was something like a tradition that wherever you were...but for the High Holidays, we all came together.</p></p></dialogue>

As a teenage I already was earning a living, going to school at the same time working, earning a living, being responsible for helping the family, being responsible for helping the education which was very went to high school. It was <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> We have all kind of groups. And we all had...uh... outlooks on life and we were already...we were...we were knowledgeable about the...the possibilities of...uh...of war ...of the expansion policies of Germany...uh... The first feelings of war came to us when Austria was incorporated, the Anschluss. Then it was the...the taking over by the Poles, part of Czechoslovakia...uh, I don't know it was a pact among Poland in Germany to divide part of the Czechoslovakia and...uh...we already saw more and more militaristic movements and we were prepared that something had happened, but we didn't...were not prepared it'll happen so rapidly and that's why when the German attacked Poland September Ist, they called it "blitzkrieg" [Ger: "Lightning War"]. We were...were looking at the...at the American...at the Polish Army, which was already beautiful dressed, the officers of beautiful shiny shoes and we really looked at them like a...a real defense group which will be able to defend the country. But...uh... shockingly enough, I think all the military lines were broken by the Germans within one day, and within the second day, the city of Warsaw was bombarded wherever you were there. And we were not even prepared that they are...when we saw planes flying we...everybody said it's our planes. It's our planes. We did not realize that we did not have an air force anymore that last...the first two days. And there were the German planes flying over us, bombarding us, and within a few days Warsaw was...uh...encircled by the Germans. I think it was...uh...September 7, when...uh... over the radio came...uh...the appeal that all people which are able to carry weapons, men specially, are being asked to leave the city and to go to the east where new defense lines are being created. I was attached so much to my family and I felt that even we are already everyday hiding in the bunkers in the cellars I couldn't leave my family and I did not...uh...follow that appeal, but most of my friends left on that day and they went east toward the Russian side. We did not even know in that days that Poland...that the decision was made that Poland will be divided between Russian and Germany, but we felt that it is safer to go toward Russia, especially those who believed in the...in the possibilities of a socialist communist government felt that the haven will be found on the other side where we had...uh...believed that...uh...after all it's This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

We knew very little really about the true...what is...what it is that government. And...uh...a lot of people left, but I choose to be with my family, and I did not leave. And I was waiting in...with the ghetto went through that...was 30 days until the Germans were occupy Warsaw because we were...defending Warsaw. We were doing everything to help each other, but we couldn't do anything against the planes which were bombarding and thousands upon thousands of people...civilians were lulled from the German bombardment, Jews and non-Jews. In those days...in the Warsaw we were free...we felt as Polish citizens defending the country and putting up the last stand against the Germans, not allowing them to come in. And that came until the day when Warsaw capitulated. The war came to an end, and the Germans marched in. Then starts a different chapter of my life. We were all hungry. I do remember the first days when the German came in. It was a parade. I was not coming to that parade because it's not in our neighborhood. I was living in the Jewish section, but I recall that...1 know that people told us there was a parade in the...in the main where the Germans...the victorious <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> back to the bunker and didn't bring bread. Mine brother, he was more lucky. And my sister was more lucky. They came back with bread. Each one of them had a loaf. And I who supposedly was the good organizer...supposed to bring the bread, came back with nothing. I was very much shocked that this was said to me to a man whom I knew and he said the bread are for Poles. And all of a sudden I who grew up with ideas of Poles was hurt that...look at this, my own Polish comrade, my own Polish neighbors are calling me, "The Jew." I know that...uh...there was a note of the anti-semitism before war, but I did not see it because I didn't want see it. I only saw the goodness in the Polish people. I saw goodness in every people. But I will not forget that first day when my eyes of the hunger saw the bread and just was so abused that I went back without bread.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What then happened?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Then...uh...We had to come out from the cellars. And whoever was lucky, whose apartment was not bombed out, we went in...back to their apartments, those who had the bombed apartments and there were many of them had to find shelter among others. So to our apartment we were joined by other members of the family which houses were bombed and they were sharing with us the apartment. Then became the daily struggle of finding food.</p><p>Uh...That occupies our minds. Nobody was expect any...uh...special, different treatments...</p><p>uh...that we would be chosen. We knew that we lost the war. What...we believed that this is not the end, that war begins, but war has to end. And we were counting on the war to...I know that the France joined immediately and England joined the war immediately, and we also hoped that the Russians will and we felt that this is a period which we have to come through and survive. But then become the difficult...the second difficulty which came was...it was winter. It was...uh...that winter it was September, it's getting cold and we had to find also not only food, but we had to find also means of...uh...of...-uh...heating and that was very problematic.

Those who had some contacts from this, and we remained without any leadership at all. Uh...Germans created a Judenrat...a Jewish...they arrested some...uh...the most prominent Jews they knew, and they created a Judenrat, and we started to be ruled as a Jewish community by the Judenrat. We were not ruled anymore by the general community...uh...by the city hall which was bombed in that time and completely destroyed, but there was a city hall, a Polish city hall.</p><p>Uh...Communications was not disrupted yet. We still had telephones in our houses. We had electricity in our houses which was...restored for everybody. It was restored for our community. And...uh...we continued the life...uh...without having any leadership.</p><p>And...uh...little by little life started to get organized. It was a struggle. It was difficult, but...uh...those who still have the homes and had the families..uh...it was...uh..</p><p>probably...uh...much easier. We were very busy right after the bombardment in burying the dead and people were drafted...not drafted, almost volunteered...we volunteered first to clean the houses to remove the dead bodies and to bring them to the cemetery and...uh.. buried them. In those days we still knew the names of the people and people had individual burial.</p><p>And...uh...we had to struggle for the daily life. That was the beginning of the days of the war. Uh...Finally after a month maybe or two, I saw that...uh...all my friends went to the west. I approached with the idea that I would like to leave. I would like to see how to go into the east. Where will you go, my Father asked, what do you mean you are going? We are here. We should be here together." But I explained to him that there's a possibility that there...I did not leave you on the September 7th, maybe I will go now if there's a possibility that we will be able to live over there, maybe everybody will possible move. My father was in the...nationally doing business. He had many clients and he in the...in the all the areas from the east. Uh...[ remember that my father used to sell his...uh...leather on credit, but it was...he was given drafts payable 90 days, 60 days from all over the country.

He gave me a bundle of drafts of people owing him money in the east. "I cannot give you anything else. Take these drafts. Whenever you're going to be in the east, try to collect something and maybe this will help you to live." Naturally, I was...uh...going around later on, when I arrived in the East, I collected very little. I...people said, "What do you mean. We're not...we haven't got our own money. How can we pay you?" So that was not...uh...not help. I was joined by a friend, who was a very close friend of mine, : <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 0 working. And...uh...they told us to go to Brest-Litovsk [Pol: Brzesc], which is...uh...the city for where...it's known by...for many things, but probably lately, you will be known by better if I would say that Begin comes from Brest-Litovsk. I went to Brest-Litovsk, and there was...uh...military compound, and they accepted us for work for...for digging ditches. And we were very happy. We got to work, and we also had a place where to sleep. It was a place where hundreds of people slept in the same house. Uh... They called them __ which is refugees. Solwasa____. And...uh...wherever I...we were earning for that day...working a day...we were paid by the day...it's sad, at the end of the day, we were paid and...uh...after getting the money. I don't...didn't have much of any other money, we passed a bakery and we bought bread. But we were so hungry that when we walked to...from the place of work...from the bakery to the house when we came to the house we did not...both have anymore bread. We had to wait for another 24 hours until we will earn the money and get another bread. So we were very hungry and very, you know, looking for a...what can we do and I did not think that to join the other groups which were traveling by trains selling from one city to the other.... We believed that we have to earn our living by work. And one night I came home and mine friend which I...

But we were lucky. We succeeded. We crossed the border, and I came back to Warsaw. I came back to Warsaw. There was no ghetto in that time. Everything was free. I arrived in Warsaw. He was living two blocks away. I made sure to bring him first to his father...to his parents. When I walked in with him to his parents" house, there was such a joy of the parents that I brought him back, that he came back, and I left and then I went back to my house. I came into my house and I will never forget. My father was there, my mother, a lot of people of the family. And he says, "What are you doing?" And I says, "I came back.</p><p>Why? I missed the family and I was hungry and I decided to be with you." My father did not speak at all, went into another room, and for the first time I saw my father crying. I am sure that he was crying that in his heart although he was opposing my departure of going to the east, he felt while I was away a lot of restrictions, German restrictions came in. He felt probably happy that one of his children is already in the East. Maybe there is a ray of hope.</p><p>He never spoke to me. I don't know exactly what he was thinking. But probably it was very painful for him that I came back. And I had the difference between one family I brought my friend and here was such a joy that I brought him. Here I came back and just created, you know, a situation where people looked at me. "What did you do? Why did you come back." But I came back. I started to look for work. I started to get accustomed to the German restrict...uh...new restrictions, and I became part again of the family. And I was sick in the first two weeks. I was bleeding. Crossing of the ices, the ices of the brook and frozen. I had some internal, probably, damaged which remain...remained with me for all my life and...uh...1 was urinating with blood for a long period.

Those days already came the restrictions. There was already talk about putting us...uh...Jews were not allowed to have any business. Jews were not allowed to have any jewelries, Jews were not allowed...all the restrictions started to come of us, and then the young people were supposed to go to work, and you could have buy out yourself of not working and pay somebody else to go to work, but the Jewish community had to deliver every day working battalions to the Germans. And life became, you know...uh...we had to adjust ourselves to the reality. That went down until probably February or March. I happened to meet a friend on the street which was one of the leaders of the youth movement where I belong. Uh...He was Mr. Borenstein.

I was responsible of making sure to maintain the library to...and to make sure to deliver the books. People were reading books. People were anxious to...to exchange the books in those days where already the curfew and...uh...there were the house committees created. When I look back today about the time when these restrictions came but the ghetto was created, I think every house in the ghetto became a community because at 7 o'clock we had to remain in the houses and I was...uh...in that house where I was living, probably at 31, as a young man and when a community was created, I became the secretary of the community...of my house. And that were again community life and...uh...since there were no schools...all schools were illegal...I organized a school in mine building, and I became the teacher of that school. I was...I had never had a preparation of being a teacher, but teaching was mostly...uh....singing together with the children, keeping them together and the children came very, very eagerly to school because part of their work was a soup. And everybody of the children was waiting when will we get that soup. So a child was...the children were so hungry so that coming to school is because they knew that during the school hours they will get a soup. And that was the most important thing why they came to school. Then I was...uh...by coincident, I was given a job when the ghetto was created already, to work in a battalion on the Aryan side. That probably...uh...was a very important moment. I did not know after months I for the first time came out...out of the ghetto to work in such a battalion. The work of that battalion was...uh...to... to...all the buildings which were burned out, standing like ...like skeletons...uh....to demolish them, but not demolish them by demolish because the bricks were very important. So we had to take...go on the top of a burned-out building and little by little take off every brick and clean it because later on these bricks were used for building other house...building, not for the...they were shipped out from the...after we cleaned them, they were shipped out. These were not for rebuilding Warsaw. It was for...for wherever the Germans need it. And I was in such a battalion working, and somehow I came to the...uh...very...was...very...very helpful that I was able to buy during the day for the exchange of all kinds of clothing which I This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

So it was not a question of getting a pay or pay for the work.</p><p>It was a question how much can I bring back to feed the family. And...uh...somehow we were guarded by...uh...a German...older Germans which were probably mobilized as...uh...to...not for duties on the frontiers. And there was one German who was in our group, used to come every morning...uh...to take us out from the ghetto and to guard us while we were working and...uh...bring us back. I don't remember the name of that German.</p><p>It was probably a man in the 50's, an older man or in 40s, late 40s or 50s. But he never screamed. There were others that were screaming cause we were...we were even afraid for the screaming of the Germans. He was never screaming. That means he was a good man.</p><p>And whenever I turned to him, asking him for permission can I go across the street, can I buy a...can I take some water or can I buy a loaf of bread, whatever it is, he would always let me do it. And he was very much attached. Uh...One day he showed me the pictures of his children. And he looked at the...one of the pictures. He says, "Here is a...my son. He's in the army. He's like you." I did not understand what he means, he's like you. He said, "He's in your age. It's the same like your age." And...uh...I don't know what went through this man. He never spoke, but somehow he thought about his son, and he looked at me sometimes and he says, "He's like you." He's my age. I don't know what he wanted to say.</p><p>If he is like you...if he's Jewish or if he's like you as a young man. But he...he was tremendously helpful. The underground, which I belonged, found out which there're doing the work that I was very much...have good possibilities of going out every day to the...with the battalion on the Aryan side and coming back. The underground started to get interested in it. And...uh...once...uh...somebody of that...the underground went with me and he came back the same night. He disappeared in the middle of the day. I don't know where he went, but he wanted probably to check out the way we are going in and going out. And we had to This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Nobody asked for names or anything. We just were counted. After a week of this...uh...going in and out, I got again a visitor from the underground who came to me...to my house and he says, "I want you to know from now on, when somebody will come and will give you that passport you accept him to go out. We understand it...the problem that somebody has to come back. We will always send somebody with you if we will have somebody to return. And that went out for a few months.

I did not have any leadership role, so I really did not know exactly what they were preparing and what they were doing, but I felt...uh...like a doing a service. And...uh...this went on. I also was able to contact on the Aryan side some people which became very friendly in the beginning for buying and I made contact with them that even once during the boarding on the Aryan side, I asked the German fellow...the...the soldier who was guarding me if I...I can leave for 2 hours, and I went to a home.

Somebody's here to see you." I walked out. And I walked out and here was a girl or I did not...uh...I only...she only gave me the password and she says, "You have to take me out today from the ghetto.". And I says, "Listen, it's too early. She says, "Yes." She says, "I am going to sit and wait here because I must leave with you together." At 7 o'clock in the morning, we had to leave the ghetto and that girl went along with me. I really did not...uh...for me was another person of the underground to be taken out. I was used to this everyday. I did not even get into any conversations. I only asked her, "Do you know anything...uh...who is going to come back cause I cannot take you." And she gave me a name of who is going to come back. So I saw she...she was very informed. I took her to the ghetto...uh...to the...to the...to the brigade...to ..and when we came to the...uh...to the gate to go through, somehow, I don't know why....what was the reason, the German who was inspecting us asked...picked on...on that girl which I took with me which it normally was not happen...says, "You go into the booth.</p><p>I got to inspect you..". Now I know that...uh...what happened with her that she had...uh...</p><p>documents...the map of the Treblinka which was drawn in the ghetto by people who came back from Treblinka to be sent by the underground and...uh...to...to London. So we had to bring it out from the ghetto. She was carrying that document. While she was in the booth...while she was in the booth, the only thing which I know that her name was Feiga and Vladka, with two names she gave me. While she was in the booth, some commotion started and a shooting started on the outside and the German left her alone, not completing the search and run out to see what's the shooting. And there was a shooting about another group, not in the group with our group. She rapidly dressed herself and she came up with me to the group because we could not leave until and she...we walked...we were given permission to walk. And she was not completely searched. (Sigh) Today, I should, you know if I recall it, you know, later on when I found out what she was carrying, I don't think that I would risk the life of the whole group because if that document will be found on her, probably the whole hundred people or whatever, all of us will be killed.

And...uh...she was also not ...uh... prepared that she will be...normally we were not searched. Anyway, after we went through and she came out and dressed and after we were on the trucks a few blocks, she jumped off the truck and I never saw her. I saw her later. Uh...This girl later on was...uh...I met her when I came to the Aryan side. This all story the way I met her. I asked for her because I wanted to know what happened with that girl and when I came back to the ghetto a lot of time the people of the underground asked me if I met Vladka on the Aryan side, and I really did not know who is that Vladka. (Sigh) She was...she got very acquainted with me and I asked... met another man on the Aryan side and I kept asking if they ever know how I can contact her. This was the time when I already decided to live on the Aryan side. I already got the passport from the underground, not to be part of anything particular on the Aryan side, but just the...the underground gave me...uh...without any assignment, they gave me a passport.

We were afraid...uh...to...to go into any public place, so we used to walk on the beach...uh...on the Vistula where few few people goes. It was cold and very few people would walk there because it was too cold, but we felt quite safe there. And most of our dates were just by walking.

It was a very decent, cultural place where we were coming in and eating lunch there. It was not a restaurant, but it was like a club maybe, but it was a place where for that when it was cold we used to sit there for hours eating lunch and talking. And little by little our...she started to tell me, she got more confidence in me. She said, "Today I was able to buy two revolvers." I looked at her. I says, "What do you know about revolvers? How do you buy it?" And she told me the story how she bought the revolvers. And she came back one day and told me that her...that she was able to test a bomb together...uh...with...uh...Mr...with Klepfisz, Michal Klepfisz, which was an engineer. I says, "Why are you getting involved in such thing? It's dangerous." I was more concerned about her than about the bomb and..uh... Anyway she promised me...I remember that, "I am not going to do such thing anymore." I don't know if she just made me feel good but I was more concerned about her. I became very much attached to her.

They changed the name on the Aryan side, Adam Novak, who was born with me in the same house...uh...a little bit younger than me. So we were the three people of the Ziferman and we were four people...or...five people of my immediate family in that small hiding. Finally, I convinced my father.

But my mother came out from the ghetto with a...with a truck, not walking because she could not...not walk such a big way. And finally I placed them all in that place. And the only protection we had was Vladka, which she came to...to us very often to inspect and the other lady, the Christian woman, did not know that...uh...Vladka is Jewish, but she knew that we are somehow connected with the underground.

In the meantime, Vladka was very much...uh...involved in the uprising and was the last shipment of ammunition to be taken to the ghetto. And I remember the...the struggle among these couriers. Everybody was very much interested to carry that ammunition to the ghetto. Today I am thinking about this.

She was not chosen in that group, but in her place Klepfisz went. ___ Klepfisz. He went with the last transport of ammunition to the ghetto. And the uprising started. The uprising started on November...on December...on April 19. It was on the Passover night (sigh).

Naturally, the drivers, they wanted to run away and they were stopped by underground boys with guns and they say, "You cannot drive. If you drive, you be killed." I was not present at this, but Vladka was present at this...at this taking out the people of the ghetto and by 60 or 70 underground fighters were brought to the Aryan side, among them...uh...which ought to...still alive is Dr. Edelman and Tzywia Lubetkin which died in <span class="page-break" number="20"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 1 as a means of making a living by hiding Jews.

So this was the best proof and we spoke to Guzik. He says, "You ask me how is it." He says, "I am sending my wife and my daughter." And it's correctly, he did send his wife and his daughter. So we felt maybe it is chance and from the underground papers we knew that something was going on that the Germans are trying to exchange Jews for trucks. We did not know exactly. But the underground never got a confirmation. So as a result Vladka did not want have nothing to do with this. Although she felt very bad that I have to leave and that's...she started to spend the last days to be with me in , she said, "I am not going to leave.

The next day the Germans came with the trucks to take the people for the transport and I overheard...uh... a conversation between the Germans...and I remained there because it was safe place to remain because I was watching already two transport leavings.

He was my enemy. And...uh...1 was looking always to be around animals. And I spent in my free time...a lot of my time in the zoo.

And...uh...anything I did...the animals I wasn't afraid.</p><p>It could have been even a tiger, I was not afraid. But I was afraid by the unknown of the human people.

Where I had to...you know, as I told you, uh...my parents had the hiding, the...the wall which was made in the shack of the two goats on the cemetery, and when there was a funeral and they had to hid themselves they had to use to go into that shack and sit in that shack. Uh...The two goats, which were in that shack, were very abrasive to my parents, never to the owner and never to me. But they always knew that they are weaker, that they can push them and...uh...when my mother passed by and my father, the goats used to really violently push them.

We were living...in the Polish uprising, we were living...uh...before the uprising, as I said, Vladka was living in Warsaw, and my parents and myself which I used to come then the cemetery was in Praga. Praga was liberated probably 3 days when the uprising days started, 2 days or 3 days after the uprising started. Uh...1 remember that we were informed by the underground that we should await an uprising because the Russian Army was closing in on Warsaw.</p><p>This was September. Uh...September...August, September 1944. So we...my parents...the cemetery were situated in a place between two factories.

That was holding, and I found a tremendous large room. But the only thing is the room was empty because usually all the...uh.. rubbish, rubble was brought in to the holes, but this was about the only place, and I decided to build that bunker and for the 2 months during the uprising I kept building that bunker and supplying that bunker with batteries with car batteries water and food and <span class="page-break" number="31"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 6 not going further." And...uh...I took over and I said to that officer, "We are not going further," and the first time I pulled the gun and I says, "I want you to walk. You go forward.</p><p>We are remaining here. And I wanna hear your voice, and if I am not going to hear your voice, I want you to know that we are going to follow with a gun." Uh...We were three against one. He had a better gun that we have, but he had no choice. He had to walk and we returned. And we returned...uh...it was also in that...uh...few hours, there were maybe the question of that young man...a wonderful fellow. He was also left alone, a Christian boy, and he asked me one thing, "Please. Swear to me that you will never let me die here. Take me out outside and kill me, but not in the...in the...in the...1 don't want to remain laying in that mud." You know it was...it sometimes the question of dying... We knew that we are...we have no chance, that maybe we will...the chances are mostly that we will die. But he did not want to die in that mud. He was ready to be outside and killed, but not in that mud and buried. There's something in...in the human...uh...nature that...it's not only that you want to have the...the privilege of living, but the privilege of dying connects in a...in a...in a way that the human be dies. We know that none of us will live forever. The dignity of dying. And I will never forget that I...although he was Christian and I turned to him in Yiddish and I am saying to him, "I am swearing to you...although you don't understand the language I am talking to you. I am swearing to you that I will never let you die here. I'll help you die outside."

Promise me that you will take me out from that hole, from this bunker and you will bring me to the cemetery and you will bury me in these two sheets." I did promise her, but fortunately I did not have to bury her.</p><p>But what was her wish? Only to be buried as a human being! Well, we were liberated in January 16, and the January 17, we came to Warsaw, and the first thing what I went...I went to the place of that bunker and I saw the place was untouched. That means the people are there. And I started to dig. I did not know that they were there and alive, all of them. When they heard me digging, they thought that they were discovered. While I was digging dirt, they were on the other side putting more dirt, in effect, in defending themselves and also deciding if they're going to be reached, they will kill the people who will get in. But it became dark at night and I did not continue because the city was...without people. I did not continue digging and I left and I went someplace to sleep...to sleep. When I came back in the morning, I heard that Jews shoot two Poles in the middle of the night. They found them and they took them to the hospital. Uh...Fortunately, they were not dead. They were just wounded. Cause they...after I left, ran out from that bunker and they went into the sewers for 3 days, and after the liberation for 3 days they still were in the sewers, not knowing that they were liberated. Three days later...I did not go anymore for digging because I was scared what I heard. I did not continue. Three days later we found them alive on the street.</p><p>They recognized us. Uh...This is one of the moments of an individual. Uh...Then I and Vladka left Warsaw with another couple...uh...together ....uh...the boy was a Christian boy and the girl was Jewish.

Vladka used to tell me, "You look like a terrible prostitute." The last day before I decided to walk out, I decided no. I took off all the clothes of the woman of the clothes and I put back my...my men's dress suit or whatever I had, the shoes. I says, "Whatever will happen will happen." The only thing which happened, I had a little bit kinked hair. And that was a weak point because...uh...</p><p>usually Jewish people had kinked hair. And I did not have the possibilities in all this time to press them. So we decided that I am going to put a big bandage on my head. And I was walking around with a bandage. Uh...the bandage became so dirty that some people said, "Why don't you go in to see a doctor because you're going to get an infection from the dirt.</p><p>How can you have a wounded head with such a dirty bandage?" So we can walked out of the city, somehow the German did not stopped us, but the Germans prepared...uh...wagons, horses and wagons, and the entire population to take those who are wounded to...because they couldn't walk the 20 miles to Pruszkow to where the trains were to take us to...because others to this concentration camp. One of the Poles saw me walking...me and Vladka, and he saw me wounded...uh...and motioned with his hand come and we jumped on his wagon and he covered us immediately with a sheet and somehow...uh...Vladka he gave a Red Cross...uh...arm band and we were...I never knew who that Pole is. He never knew who I am. He did not think that Hitler was thinking that he's saving a Polish patriot.</p><p>And...uh...this way we escaped. When the whole column of the...of the...of the horse...the wagons moved, when we came in between the woods someplace, we run out of that wagon, and we run and we came to Pruszkow to another city...town, and there where I was able to remain for awhile. I rented a...uh...a small...a bed, with a Polish woman and husband. I don't think that she...that they were from the high class society. She was.. baby was...was not...she was not such a delicate person. But whether I do, the Germans every night used to go around and look for the party...for the people who escaped to find them.

And anytime we heard at night that it's going to be, you know, there're going to look for the people, I convinced them that he should...we should both hide. The woman doesn't matter. But the men should hide. And I pushed him in that hole laying but while...while he was laying with me there for 1 night, the second night, the third night he says, "Czeslaw. I am not going to go in. I am not a Jew, I should be hiding." He didn't turn...he didn't think for a minute that I am a Jew, but he didn't want to hide himself. And that day in the morning I talked to Vladka, "It's time to leave because I think he's getting a little bit nervous and there where the bicycle came handy. We took...we had two bicycles. We bought two bicycles and with these two bicycles, we started to travel to find different spots.

We helped them dress the Christmas tree. We really brought in the holiday to them, and they were looking up at us as the people from the city who knew how to prepare the table and holiday. But most of the Poles hated us. Not because we were Jews....the peasants, because we were the people of the city. And the people that...the peasants hated the people of the city. As a result we always got... got always the worse work. Any type of work which was nobody wanted to do it was given to me. Let's let the guy from the city do the job. But I did not...uh...mind as long as I can survive. But why I want to bring out this and that's also something typical. When the Russians arrived on January 16, we were liberated. Uh...Everybody run to this stable because it belonged...and everybody grabbed a horse, a cow, and a...the liquidated the whole...the whole...uh...farm which was a major farm. And everybody took a horse and brought them to this place. And we did not think about it. I think we went to see the commander. Myself, Vladka and that Krysia. And the commander, I think, was Jewish.</p><p>We walked in to him and we told him that we would like him to help us to leave the town...the village and to go to the city. And I think that he should help us and I...we turned to him and we says, "I think you are Jewish." When he heard this, he stood up and he got very angry. "Who told you that I am Jewish." I did not want to tell him you look like 10 Jews, so "I have the feeling that you Jewish." But he did not want to admit. And he said, "Please do not show up anymore in this place. Go wherever you want." He...he didn't want to give us any help at all. So we decided to use again these bicycles and we went to Warsaw.

Later on, the next building, the Jewish committee was created.</p><p>Maybe...I don't know if I was coincidental or not, but the next building Targowa 40, the Jewish Committee was created. And...uh...my father, I don't know, immediately went to Loublin...uh...which was liberated before and I was not with him, but I recall that he told me how he met his brother, his youngest brother. He met with him on the street in...in Lublin.</p><p>They just came across each other on the street. They embraced, but for an hour they cried together. None of them asked who's alive. My uncle later told me that...uh...the story how he met with my father. That he says, "Don't you ask me who's alive?" He says, "Why should I ask you. I think everybody is dead." So he told him, "My wife is alive." And he told him, "My wife is alive." They were even afraid to tell if somebody is alive and ask about anybody else. Naturally, in 2 or 3 days later, my father came back to Warsaw and...uh...immediately got...engaged himself in the public work and then making a living, buying, selling, whatever he did and that's... A week later my uncle came to me and says, "Listen. I want you to do me a favor. You are with Vladka. We know everything. But father insists on the Huppah. And I spoke with Vladka, and she said, "Why not?" I think that was 10 days after liberation or 8 days in that room where we were hiding, we had a million of people. I think it was the first Huppah in Warsaw after the war. I am trying to tell you things of personal interest, but at the same time I am avoiding to tell you things of our involvement in the types of happenings of others. I spent a life with Vladka together in...as a Christian boy....involved, endangering life, never thinking that we are endangering in work with others. There were many people in the underground. The majority of the people in the underground which did the work what we were doing is sometimes maybe much more heroic of what I have to tell you, did not survive. They perished, not only by being Jews, but by helping others to survive. I don't know if history will do justice, that This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

People usually talk of those who survived, but our survival was not built because we were smarter. Our survival was not built that we were more capable. Everything what happened to us was just coincidental. It was sheer luck, sometimes more than your own intuition. It was sheer luck of situations we went through. But I would like to leave a legacy is to leave a legacy of those who did not survive.</p><p>They are always forgotten. There are many people alive today which survived because others cared for them, and mainly the others were the Jewish boys and Jewish girls...the majority of them did not make it.

The Warsaw ghetto is only a symbol. There were other ghettos and there people were sacrificing lives in other ghettos too. There were concentration camp. But the Warsaw ghetto will be remembered for many reasons because Warsaw represents like the symbols for others. Warsaw, I think, today life, especially Jewish life, is very organized. I wish it could have been organized like this the years when we were there. The war would be different. Jewish life was organized to such an extent that every house had their own committee. And we cared for each other. We had no means, but we shared. We were living under constant terror and more...more important, we were living under constant feeling of hunger and helplessness. We were living in a world abandoned by the entire world, by neighbors. We could have looked into the windows of our neighbors through the wall and our neighbors could have looked into the ghetto. But...uh...there was very little reaction. What was the aim of the creation of the ghetto. Today, I start to understand this. I did not understand this in those years. The other was the concentration, a gathering of...ingathering of the victims under the conditions of making them...uh...impossible to live, deprived of everything. Everything what we did in the ghetto was illegal. Eating bread, which was rationed, was illegal. Beside breathing, if you could, everything was illegal.</p><p>Schools were closed.

But it was done with calculation. Today we know the way we were treated in the Warsaw ghetto, people were treated not a ghetto, there was a pattern. Nothing was done in the ghettos by just by the will of the commander which came. He came with a text book and with instructions how to create Judenrat, how to create ghetto, how to create the rationing, how to create the labor camps. Everything was well __. So when we speak about the ghettos, we should also remember the way the people, not only militarily opposed them, which is important, but the spiritual resistance.
