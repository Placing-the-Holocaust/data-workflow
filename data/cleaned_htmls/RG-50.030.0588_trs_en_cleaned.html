<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, I sounds like in what--you're saying is that he was born in a place where at least his family had been for an generation?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Or two, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Do you know how your family--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: [have no idea.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Now, her name is unusual in my--when I hear it--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Limburger?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No, Katherine, because Katherine is a Catholic name.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You know, I never--she never was called that. She was called Katty or Kater, and I assume--that's how I knew it, and I knew her as Mutter.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, of course.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So it was Kater or Katty.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And she came from a place called Rexingen. My husband and I have been back to both places. Rexingen had the largest percentage of Jews of any place, and 40 percent of the population of Rexingen was Jewish.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Wow.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And a lot of them were called Limburger, and I always thought they were all related.</p><p>They were not all related. They came from a place in Poland called Limburg.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And Limburg I believe is the German name for (? Livoff?)</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I don't know.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah. I'm not sure, but I believe that they called (?Livoff?) Limburg, or could be many places or some other small--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: But they were not all related.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How interesting. How interesting. So your mother's family actually eventuallyway back, could have come from Poland? To Rexingen?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You know, I was--I was 12 when I left; and you know, bringing up children in Germany was quite different from these days. You didn't tell them your history. You were just there, and you just did things.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you the oldest? The youngest?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. I was the oldest of five.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You were the oldest of five. Who was born after you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My sister, Edith.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Remember there's a mike. Okay. There's a mike on you. There's a mike on you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: She was--that's my sister, Edith.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. And in a second she's going to put--put the machine on you again. (Unrelated conversation) So this is a picture of Edith taken in what year?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't know when that was taken. Edith died in "98, and after her, Ruth was born. And then Herman was born in--she was born in "30; Herman was born in "33, but I don't have a picture of him right away. And then Esther. Where's Easter? She should be on here. See</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="3"></span>  this man? Somehow or other I think it devastated the German economy when all these Jews left. And they're now doing a history. I'm sure you're aware of that. There used to be a man--I had to write to Germany for birth certificate or something to this little place called Korb.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So the place your were born in?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Where I was born. And there was a man there who knew my father by the name of (?Weterhour?) who's doing a history of the Jews that lived in that area. The problem was (?Weterhour?)--my German is gone. It's gone. And he couldn't talk English; so all the letters were in German which I had to have translated, and I think in "90, my son--where's my son--here. Had to go the France, and he says, "You know, Mom, I'd like to go to Adelsheim because that's where we lived," and I wrote to (?Weterhour?) And low and behold, I got a letter back in English. (?Weterhour?) was getting too old to take care of</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So that's the last name of the man?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's the last name of the man. This man was taken and his English is wonderful. So Allen went to Germany and met him, and he persuaded us go to.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: To visit?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: There's another little village called Sennfeld, which is near Adelsheim where the synagogue was still standing. And he--they opened it as a museum. | think upstairs are oldfashioned farm utensils, and down stairs is all Jewish. So we've been there.</p><p>(Background noise)</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But mostly we don't--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, out of five, this waswe really very close. These are my nieces. I got eight nieces, one nephew, and one son. So there are ten cousins.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you were four girls and one boy?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you were the oldest?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was you language growing up in--in home. Was it Yiddish, or was it German?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was German. I didn't--I don't--I can't speak Yiddish.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were there any other languages they were spoken at home? Did you feel yourself German, more German than Jewish, or equally German as Jewish?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I never gave it a thought. I knew I was German, and I knew I was Jewish.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And it was normal?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can you let me a little bit about what life was like. It wasn't Adelsheim that you have the most memories. What are your earliest memories?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because I was a year old when they moved from Korb to Adelsheim.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you have some earliest memories you could share?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: My father was very strict. I think he was boss, and there were--because of his one leg- -we lived on a hill. We were never allowed to go bicycle riding. We were never allowed to go to snow--sledding because he as afraid that if we needed help, he couldn't--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: He couldn't be there to do it?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He couldn't be there to do it. But we did. We did.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How can you keep kids from doing stuff like that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [know. And when we were out playing, and he wanted us to come home, he would stand in the front of the steps of our house and whistle. Everybody in that little Adelsheim knew that whistle so.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That was Mr. Rosenfeld's whistle?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't know what else. I think we had very normal childhood.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was your mother like? Was she somebody who stayed at home and took care of the house, or did she work?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, not really because when the weather was bad, she had to go with him to do whatever earned him a living because of his--he couldn't walk on ice. He couldn't walk on snow. So...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So she was part of his business?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I guess so, yeah. I guess so.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And how did he lose his leg?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In the war.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But as a soldier?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yeah, yeah.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: He was in the front?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. And, you know, when you're growing up, you accept things and you don't look at ages and somebody who's maybe fourfoot tall if you're that big, their tall. But he was only a teenager. When I think back of when he lost his leg, he was only a teenager when he lost his leg.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And so he was also very young when he became a father because that was</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In the 20s. Did he talk about World War I with the kids? Did he tell stories?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No. I just remember him saying, when he came home from the war, he went on a motorcycle, and he had a bad experience. I don't know what happened, but I remember he said, "Don't ever go on a motorcycle."</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So he was fearful for his kids?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, yeah. Friday nights he would inspect our hair for lice, our nails, our toenails. I think German men--I don't know about only Jewish men. I don't know anything about any other men--were very bossy. Very, you know, weren't they? So that I remember, and I remember when he came homebefore he went to the war, he had apprentice as a baker.</p><p>Well, when he came home and didn't have a leg, he couldn't continue baking, but he used to make (?Holis?) And he used to make tortes. He used to cook. He used to bake.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, that's also unusual for a man in--in a place where there was very distinct roles that were assigned to who does what.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I guess, yeah. I suppose. You know, when you</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You don't think of things like that when you're a kid?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not really. Not really.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was your mom like?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: She was a doll. You know, but it's over 70 years. It's hard. At this point you don't know what you imagine or what was real. It's very hard.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Does that mean you don't have memories of her?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yeah. Oh yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And so do you--can you say that there are some memories you know are real or distinct?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yeah. I remember. I remember cleaning for (?pay self?) on the ceiling to theto the attic to the basement. And, you know, when you have five kids, you're very busy.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you kind of in charge of some of the other kids, being the oldest?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [remember diapering Esther, and I remember after three girls when Herman was born, when he woke us up when he was born, that was a big thing. That was a big thing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What kind of education level did your parents have?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't remember. I don't really know. I don't really know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did you father attend Gimnazium or--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I don't think so. He was in the army as a teenager, and then he apprenticed--honestly I don't know.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Neither one of them was a professional.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And we were expected to get A's, and I do remember later on when our grades got bad, he was very upset, and the grades got bad because of Hitler. You know.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell me in what way? In what way did this affect you? In what way, you know, you were children. You were--in 1933, when he came to power, how old were you, eight?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. And how many 8yearolds remember what happened, especially if it was a bad thing that happened, you know?</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But it was a Jewish school that you went to?</p></p></dialogue>

And he came over and he said, "You don't have to do that." I don't know why that stands, but I also don't know whether that's real or not real.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> </p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Number 10 Elm street in England--in London--an outskirt of London, and they had a maid, and I spent a lot of time in the kitchen with the maid, and I think when she asked me something and didn't understand, she would show me. I think I had to credit her with learning English. Of course, I was going to school, and I didn't do too well in school, I think. They were never too happy with my grades.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So your aunt worked for a welltodo Jewish family?</p></p></dialogue>

This is the British. So one day he's sitting, and he's going like this (tapping sounds on the table) and I said, "Shut up." Well, you would imagine that was the call for the maid. And since then, I have never used shut up on anything.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did he understand that you didn't know?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yeah. He understood. He understood.

I don't know how she knew Doctor (?Lobby Nickels?) but they had a maid who was German, and my aunt wasto tell you the truth, I really don't know, but anyhow Ruth went to live with Doctor Lobby Nickles.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah, before the war. I think they must have advertised it for people who wanted to take--because they got 10,000 kids out. And a couple in Whales had wanted a child, but then I think the husband got sick or something was sick. Now this couple, Harrison, lived in Norwich, England, and Norwich, England, there were a lot of shoe factories and Harry Harrison worked in a factory that was owned by a Jew, and on the bulletin board that they needed homes for--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Children.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="14"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Children.

Well, Kindertransport went to London, and from London she was going to Norwich, but my mother had written to my aunt that-what was happening. So she wentmy aunt went to the station to see Esther, and Esther naturally walked towards her. I guess because she looked like my mother. I don't really know. But she went to the Harrison's, and the Harrison's were not Jewish. And they had one son, and you would think--Allen was seven, I think, at the time. You would think he would be jealous of her.</p><p>He adores--to this day, he adores the ground she walks on. He's been over herecomes over here quite often. And he's likethe parents have since died, but that's how Esther got to the Harrison's.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You know, I never--no because we were always told that my parents would pick us up in England and we were coming to America.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Germany. How diddid you--do you and your siblings have different attitudes towards Germany and going back and returning?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I don't know about Edith. She was in Germany duringwhen she was in the army, she was stationed in Germany, and she would tell meand she and somebody else went to Adelsheim.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: When she was in the army.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. British Army.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And someone on the street stopped her and said, "Are you Adolf Rosenfeld's daughter?" So that's what happened. Let's see--but their attitude--I remember Esther said to me--who can't remember Germany. She was tooshe was thinking of going back, and she said to me, "Did you ever consider going back?" As if they couldget lost in the sea--I said, "No. I wouldn't." Well, she persuaded me to change my mind, but that was in, I think "89 or something. I don't remember the date, but Morris got sick. So they wentwe made agreements to go, but Morris got sick, and she and her husband went. So I guess that was my attitude at that time. I don't ever care to go back, but when Allen went and met Rinehart, I changed my mind. I went to the house where I was born, you know. Have you ever lived in a small place?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: No--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Whenin a little town, you see a bunch of people, and you wonder why they're there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>We were standing in Korb. Rinehart had taken us there. In front of this, he says, "This is the house," and I have pictures of the house. That's where your father lived. So we were standing there, and somebody from the house looked out, and they wondered while all these people were standing there, and they said something. And it was the daughter who hadher parents had bought the house from my father, and she didn't live in it, but she came there once a year to go to the cemetery of her parents, and that's when she stayed in the house. So they just happened to be in the house and they asked us into the house. We went into the house. Then we went back to Adelsheim. The German government had sold</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="25"></span>  my parent's house to somebody who we wentwere invited into that house, which had changed greatly from when we lived in it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you had memories of how it had looked before?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yeah, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you have anydid you have any photographs that--let's say relatives had gotten in the United States that would have had your family before you went on the Kindertransport that would have had pictures of the place of where your lived, of how your parents looked, and things like that? We'll put it on tapethis photo that you're showing me of your family before the Kindertransport, it must have been very recent before the Kindertransport.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was. I think so.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Because Esther's already--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: She looked a little--yeah, yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, yeah.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Twice.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Twice?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In "90, and in "95.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. That must have been wrong.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay. So it would have been one of those</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: [have to ask Esther.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. So that would have meant three times that you've been back.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="26"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. That was over the weekend.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay. So</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: But it was a funny thing, you know, Rinehart had wrote us what they were doing, and he wrote to me, andI said to Esther, "You know, Esther, I think we ought to go." And she just went like that. About 2025 years ago, I got a letter from someone in Ireland. And said, "Dear Mrs. Esenstad, I think we are related." Well, he's thethe man who wrote it is a geologist, and he had been in a department in Ireland, and he went to Germany for a dig, and, you know, they keep all kinds of records. His mother was Jewish. His father wasn't, but when the war started--or beforehis Jewish grandmother and his Jewish aunt came to live with them in England, and they got to England because they were antiNazi and they escaped. I think they met at the university somewhere in Germany and went to work for the pope. And they both converted to Catholicism, but he said he was greatly influenced by his Jewish grandmother and aunt. So when he went back to Germany on a dig, he thought he would find out about his mother. I had written to Germany because I needed copies of birth certificates, and that led him to Korb, and when he got to Korblater I said to him, you know, soandso is in Englandis in America. And he wrote. They gave him my address, and he wrote to me, and he told me how we were related. He sent us family trees.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How were you related?</p></p></dialogue>
