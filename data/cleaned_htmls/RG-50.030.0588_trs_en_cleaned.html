I do remember when Iwhen we were in Adelsheim, we had to say, "Hail Hitler" to the to the teachers, and I don't know why that stands in my mind, but I met a teacher, and I was carrying books, and I dropped the books and said, "Hail Hitter." And he came over and he said, "You don't have to do that." I don't know why that stands, but I also don't know whether that's real or not real.</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And I guess that was Hitler who won. You know, the irony is we had a lot of relatives in America, and the whole family had affidavits to come to this country, but there was this stupid quota, and that's whyI remember my father was the second youngest. There was an uncle--younger. They were in business together in Adelsheim, and it was a question of whether my father should come, whether we should come, or his younger brother, and I remember he said his younger brother because if he can't work anymore he always has his pension.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Number 10 Elm street in England--in London--an outskirt of London, and they had a maid, and I spent a lot of time in the kitchen with the maid, and I think when she asked me something and didn't understand, she would show me. I think I had to credit her with learning English. Of course, I was going to school, and I didn't do too well in school, I think. They were never too happy with my grades.</p></p></dialogue>

So</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: But it was a funny thing, you know, Rinehart had wrote us what they were doing, and he wrote to me, andI said to Esther, "You know, Esther, I think we ought to go." And she just went like that. About 2025 years ago, I got a letter from someone in Ireland. And said, "Dear Mrs. Esenstad, I think we are related." Well, he's thethe man who wrote it is a geologist, and he had been in a department in Ireland, and he went to Germany for a dig, and, you know, they keep all kinds of records. His mother was Jewish. His father wasn't, but when the war started--or beforehis Jewish grandmother and his Jewish aunt came to live with them in England, and they got to England because they were antiNazi and they escaped. I think they met at the university somewhere in Germany and went to work for the pope. And they both converted to Catholicism, but he said he was greatly influenced by his Jewish grandmother and aunt. So when he went back to Germany on a dig, he thought he would find out about his mother. I had written to Germany because I needed copies of birth certificates, and that led him to Korb, and when he got to Korblater I said to him, you know, soandso is in Englandis in America. And he wrote. They gave him my address, and he wrote to me, and he told me how we were related. He sent us family trees.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How were you related?</p></p></dialogue>
