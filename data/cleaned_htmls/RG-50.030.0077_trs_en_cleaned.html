<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mrs. Gach, uh thank you for coming to visit with us this morning. We're going to be asking you uh to share with us some of your experiences as you recall them, and perhaps the best way to begin is to ask you to tell us your name and a little about your early life in Budapest.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: OK. My name is Lilly Brust Gach. I was born in uh Hungary in Europe, Hungary, Budapest, and uh I had a brother who was younger than I myself, _ three years and uh we had a wonderful, happy family life and childhood. Beautiful. Well educated, if I may say so myself, both of us. Uh we had elementary school. Naturally we started with that.</p><p>We don't have the kindergarten and what we have here, which is wonderful. From there we went to the high school. I was sent out to Vienna for my German, Switzerland to my...Swiss as to my French, and I was a happy-go-lucky girl. So was my brother. And uh we finished school. I got married very early, very happily, and uh then Eva was born.</p><p>Made us more happy, and since then she's my...my life. My husband passed away here in this country, 1957, January. It's a long, long time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: OK. Let's go back then to the time when you were growing up in Budapest. You had mentioned that you had a happy childhood.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, I did.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell us about the changes that you remember in the life of the Jewish community in Budapest at whatever time you can recall.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well uh, the Jewish...how should I say it...as a young girl I was going to the big holidays with my mother. I can sit next to her and I was very proud being there. So was my brother who was sitting downstairs uh with my father, my uncle, and many other family uh and friends whom we know, and I was really brought up in a very warm, Jewish family. I wasn't too religious, but all the holidays we were keeping and we got together with the family, mother's, father's, and this was it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And when did you first realize there were changes in the experiences of the Jewish community?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: That's a very good question, what you ask me. I realized the first time when I was in Vienna, Vienna, in the school , they call that. And uh I spoke fluently German <span class="page-break" number="0"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Do you remember what year that was?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yes. Sure. It was in 1927.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: 1937 I think...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Die 21s</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: OK.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: This is the first time that I went to Vienna. I was fifteen or sixteen years old. So she gave me a very interesting answer, and uh naturally whatever she said, it was fine. But I came back to Hungary and I told my parents. They said you couldn't read that. You you misunderstood. They didn't believe it. So I stopped asking because maybe I made a mistake. Even so I was reading fluently and these are two words which you cannot...I mean Jewish is Jewish...Juda...and dog is dog. . So this was...this was the first time, and it bothered me, but when, you know, young girl, going back to school and this was the end of it. Now then in Europe what's going on. Naturally in Germany, so the</p><p> ...they always said it cannot happen to us. This was the motto. Then come closer. <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> be notified where to go. When the paper comes, he should be ready, and then he will notify us where he is. We shouldn't worry, so I was worried. I don't have to tell you...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember who he got the paper from?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh sure. Oh sure. Well, this was a paper from the Hungarian uh...what was that...uh ministerial (ph) that he is going in...some were called in for being soldiers. Then some were called in to the so-called labor camps. Each man that they were working on the highways. They went up to...they were taken up to the mountains. There was nothing for them, so they made their own ditches for uh important things and then they they got...uh they were putting up huts for them. They were put in a uh train which took them...in Hungary, we were still in Hungary...naturally I went out with him. And uh I was very upset. I I didn't know what's going on, so they're starting to read the letters or the telephone calls. L...we didn't know what...what is labor...labor...labor camps mean.</p><p>Absolutely not. So then I started to work in uh his business and helping out and I was busy, and my daughter, naturally, and uh he wrote me a card. I showed you that I think.</p><p>The first one and then the second one that uh he's alright. I shouldn't worry, and uh there are a lot of people there. He's very...not helpful because he is not uh a person who can work on the fields but anyway he's trying his best. The food is so...I should take care of Eva...all my love. Open card...this was all read by the people how I found out. Sometimes it was crossed...he said something not...not . Then I started to find out what that <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> You have your family. Uh and uh so after two weeks he had to go back, to a different place. 101 . This was his name...or this number of that camp. So I went with <span class="page-break" number="2"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: ...one...he came back again but that time it was bad. This was a , which <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> never went back. The bank account was closed. And this was it. We were still at our home, became a Jewish house because he worked it out because he was up there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What does it mean...it became a Jewish house?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It meant that uh gentile people who were living in the house, houses where we were living, if they want to they can go out and they can take other houses where the Jews will be taken out from their apartment and they can have better apartments or whatever, and these people will and all these people, not one couple left our building, and there was at least fifty-fifty.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Who established your house as a Jewish house?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The Jewish . You had to ask for it. You had to have a reason because there are more Jews than gentiles for we should stay there. Now he was really there as a councilor and he said listen, we are fifty-four percent at least, and if you can do it, and I bring in in our apartment in every room some friends of ours...husband, wife, children, so according to that we had like six-room apartment here and they Ok'd it and the owner of the building Ok'd it, and so in every room we had a couple friends. I had an aunt and her husband and a son. He was sent to labor camp, shot in the with a child, and she was without. Then we had different friends. One is up in Toronto. Another one in ...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But during this period of time...?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We were together.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You lived in a safe house?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. We were living in a safe house, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And that was the term that you used for the Jewish house?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. This is what we used.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And your husband during those periods of time when he was living with you in the Jewish house, maintained his contact with the...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: With the Jewish ...this was the only place he could go. There was nothing for <span class="page-break" number="3"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Uh I couldn't tell you that. I can't remember that really, because they were not important in a way. They didn't have any demands on on the Jewish except that we should pay more taxes because the had a....the Jewish has a certain tax. We we we paid that. But nothing. The first one was when the Germans came in which was in 1944. There was no more labor camp for him, and uh the minute when we became allies to the Allies, then naturally the Germans who were allies became enemies</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And how did that manifest itself? What did you see?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, first of all, in our buildings were people, German-speaking people...one from Austria, a few from Germany...(cough-clearing throat) and we all spoke German and many other...a few other languages, and we got very friendly. They were younger people and they were out of their home, so they figured we invite them. They had beautiful libraries. Come over for a cup of coffee or some Hungarian cookies, you know, and they came over. When the Germans came over...took over, and I'm using the elevator, I see one of my favorite ones...he was the youngest. He was a Viennese and I knew Vienna very well. It was...I was there in school a long time ago then and uh he said, _, what do I do now? I mean you...are you an enemy? I said I am never... will be never an enemy and I am with you and whatever I can do, I'll do it. So this was a very good feeling and I didn't know...should I ask him to come in or shouldn't I? So I talked it over with my husband. I said...don't change. As what he said, you take his words. If he wants to, he comes in anyway, so don't say no, and he was right, so he came in and we were there.</p><p>One night around two-thirty...in the...it morning...sorry...somebody knocks our door, and</p><p> . This was the time when the Germans collected the people...two thirty in the <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> checked it. Naturally no time did they know the factory. They called it and they said oh yes, he's one of our biggest but we don't hear from them. Whatever you can say...I know Mr. Brust very well, or Herr Brust possibly and uh so he got...we were . 1 think we <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> worry. We will survive and then you'll give us back whatever we spent on you, or we give something for them, you know, whatever we had in our apartment.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: OK. So we've now established that through a period of time there were difficulties, but it wasn't all that difficult for you. When did it become actually a serious...?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We became...yes...when we were told that we should move in from that Jewish house uh to the Swedish house, because they cannot...the Germans won't respect our Jewish house and they will just...we we saw it. I mean they collected people on the street. They came in in the houses and uh in the morning, two, three o'clock. Uh in the meantime, the big war, the Germans went all over Europe. It started in Holland, in Belgium, always in the early morning and we heard that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What did you hear...that people were being collected?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: First of all we didn't have a radio. We were not allowed to have a radio, so the big one...we had a big, old-fashioned radio...there was no television at that time...they took it away, but my husband had a small one, and we put it in his drawer, and he opened Churchill...German...I mean England.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was it that you were hearing that was happening to the Jewish people who were being taken away?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, everything what what went on...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Which was...?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: First of all in Austria, they collected the people. They went...they were taken to certain uh...even in my family. They were picked up and disappeared, and we didn't know. A cousin of mine who is here in this country...he's quite a young man...he's not a young man anymore...he and his mother were taken. Then we got a card, a postcard, some kind of...what is that...uh sea...not sea...uh uh what is that...it is like a uh....</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The specific place isn't important.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. Anyway, he got a card...we got a card that he is .</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> AS is a little...uh it's not an ocean. It's like a... <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> 0</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It's a lake.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It's a lake. I should know that. That was...I'm going absolutely...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The question that I was asking was in reference...?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My husband was always in the Jewish . [showed him, look here what what what we got from Steven. So he said I just wanted to let you know. You know what that is...this is Auschwitz. I said what is that. And he got the notice from the...in the meantime is that Wallenburg showed up. Of course, he was an angel sent from God. I met him twice when I was going for my husband. I didn't want him to go alone on the street, and uh...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Before we get to Mr. Wallenburg, I'd like to go back to that point about the Germans were collecting people...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Collecting people from their home. They take them out. They had a big truck down on the street. They were pushed in in the car. They never knew then where they're going, how long do they...will they be away, nothing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But you did get some indication that some...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We thought they are disappearing. In the meantime we heard the BBC, late evening, you know, quietly.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Saying...?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And then Mr. Churchill and the English uh tele...uh radio told us what's going on in the war.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What did they tell you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They told us there is an Auschwitz. There is a Mauthaussen. There is a Theresienstadt.</p><p>We had never heard that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And what did they tell you was going on?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That this is a collection where the Hungarian people or wherever they are from Europe, they are put...they are put in a in a train without food. Everything is taken away from them before and then the left-over when they arrive and uh they are put in in ovens. So I said well, the English, I love them but uh they are crazy. How can they say that? I mean this is...it's impossible. You know, everybody said that because you don't believe that. So then Steven's first card came from and my husband says, you know what this is? <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> 1 our old house, in our old apartment, and we told...he told them. He was almost killed by our friends. They said you are crazy. You're picking up this news...this is...there is no such thing. And even so, if you hear it, tell it to Lilly, to your wife. Don't tell us because we don't believe it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And that was...that was...?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Don't ever say that. Just tell me. I want to know every word you want to say. Because I didn't want him to hold back.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: OK. So...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Then we went over to the Swedish house.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And what was it like in the Swedish house?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: This is a very beautiful house, four or five floors and uh we had the paper from the Swedish king that we are...we can stay there. We went in, early morning. Kitchen was full with mattresses. Everything was mattresses. So I said, you know...I was frightened and my husband says, you know, I don't want to stay there. So Eva said I am tired. I want to stay there. I sit down. She has this doll and uh a tack board (ph), . So I said leave it there sweetheart, and we will...doll here or a book and take the doll...now I remember well...and we will be back. We disa...we went out. They said don't forget you have to be back until five. . We never came back, because we decided but this is a <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> 2</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Uh Wallenburg was...I met him before we went to hiding. I was still a Jewish passport and I tell you how I met him. I picked up my husband and there was a big conference, and he was uh...my husband and the Jewish ___, the people, the President whom I knew very well there, Mr. Stern (ph), uh they had a big...and my husband said sit in in the back and just listen. You know that man? I said yes, I heard him but I never met, so he introduces...a very tiny looking, blue-eyed, blondish skinny man. If you would see him on the street, you wouldn't say oh my God, I have to look back, you know, because he's nothing. Very simple. And I listened. He spoke uh German and uh naturally and uh I listened and he said listen...I know, you have to tell me what you can do for the Germans, and you have to tell me what the Germans are telling me, telling you. Let's say they are collecting uh uh this part of the cou...of of the city or this part and I will be there and I try to stop the train that it shouldn't go, and and then he repeated it, so this <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> 3</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Eichmann. He is the nightmare. He came in, very handsome looking, funny face...you know, something which is...which , very elegantly dressed, boots.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You say he came in?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He came into the Jewish . He said I am so and this is my name or his title... don't remember what he was...and I am talking for my government. Now we are...we were allies and now we are enemies but we are still allies and when you want to uh have your...have your...the the freedom a few Jewish people, and I will have request for you, and if you can give it to me, I will take a few out and they can stay or we're going to send them...they don't go too far. We put them in the train, nice story. They will work. They will help us out in the factories here, factories there and that's all. Now we knew this wasn't true because we heard the BBC. This was our...this was the bible because we knew the truth.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So Eichmann was telling you the story...?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Eichmann did that, so he came in and he said I need now I don't know how many beds.</p><p>Get them. Said we don't have beds. You have hospitals, Jewish hospitals, this hospital. I send my men and we just tell them they should give it to them, so then he he got that.</p><p>What do we get for that, we were asking, not to him but the...I mean , so he said <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> 4 minutes. He said no, he's not in. So he said we are...I'm going down now and I'm going and I want to find out what happened. As I'm going down...a lot of people <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> 5 immediately our...his secretary... mean my husband's secretary, John. He is coming back. You walk on this side on the avenue and I'm walking this side.

What happened to the other part. They were sent...not all...a few came down. He said I was picked up...he had no idea what was going on, but I was up there. I didn't...1 wouldn't dare to tell him that, and I never did, and I said well, I just talked to the president after all and I told him that I would like to have you back because you are needed here.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And once he got back...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He went immediately back to the to the and said I am back. Thank you for asking for me and what can I do?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And what did he do?</p></p></dialogue>

He was a watch importer from Switzerland, and actually I didn't even call him. He found out...he came in the building, found...finding us, trying to find us. Not he but she, the wife of his, lovely, tall, good- looking woman asked Joseph where are they. So he said I want to talkto__--_--. T have an apart...uh a home up on the mountains, which is a beautiful . We had there too but we didn't talk about it, and this was given by a Jewish family that we should take care of it, and this is empty. We are going up there. We don't want to stay in the city. I want to have these three people, so we went up to that apartment. Finally, the husband, who was an officer of the Hungarian army, was in Russia, was all over the German army because we were allies. He came home without permission. He was afraid. The Germans...he was not the Germans anymore, with the Germans because they became enemies. He was with the Russians, but he was in Russia with the Germans, so this was a very unpleasant feeling for him, and he was afraid so he left the army. He took...they took off his army stuff except a beautiful jacket which he picked up in Germany...in Russia, with uh fur...fur-lined, and he came up and so we got in to this apart...to this beautiful house.</p><p>There was another officer, .

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And when they saw the Russian soldier...?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, they were happy, except him and uh well, I wasn't sure if I'm happy or not because I didn't...first of all, I knew that they are with the Americans so they cannot be that bad.</p><p>On the contrary, they are allies, but I didn't know that. So they came from house to house and they came into our house. The first one was , which means give me your <span class="page-break" number="11"></span> 8</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And is that how the war ended for you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, not yet. Oh no. This Russians...they were not bad. They were horrible looking with newspapers packed...uh their shoes. There were no shoes. They were using cigarettes and newspapers, picking up uh leaves, you never saw anything like that. They picked us up.</p><p>This Russian commander went...he became our friend. He brought some bread, but he was stealing that he was bring here. This was always...this was fine. A big Russian...it was late evening...he comes in to the...the Germans are coming back. We take you down.</p><p>We belong to them. And we didn't mind. To get Russian is better than the Germans. I don't know why but this...this was normal feeling and uh we were all transferred. There was a lot of people again and we got in a truck. We went down...I never was there...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Down to...?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> AE Down... ...we went down and we went out of Budapest which is let's say if I <span class="page-break" number="12"></span> 9</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: ...Russians liberated Budapest and if you could tell us how the end of the war appeared to you and what you did with your husband and your daughter at that point in time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. So when the Russians started out during the war that they were liberating us, and we were really lucky because when they went down to the village, there were Russians coming and going through the village. They...sometimes they came in in the houses and uh brought some food or...and that we should do it food and we should do it, and I wasn't a good cook and my husband had no idea what what cooking is, but there were others, so we helped. And then what they didn't use, they didn't eat up, they left it for us, but we couldn't do anything with that, but we were afraid from them. That's the honest truth. Even so they were liberating and I felt that uh they won't harm us, uh it was a very difficult time.</p></p></dialogue>
