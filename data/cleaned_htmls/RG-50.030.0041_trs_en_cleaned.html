<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In Sosnowiec. Wait a minute. Let me see how I called [Pofsehna School (ph)]. It's not a high school; it's a middle school. That's how you call it? See I was uh I went to <span class="page-break" number="0"></span> mother and my brother, and the people who were working for us - that's what I remember.</p><p>That's what I'm telling you. And we were at the store and I remember the, the Germans came and rushed in, the Germans and the, and the armed tanks and mine brother was missing. He was not at home and my - was shooting and I remember that my mother went to look for him and brought him home. That's what I remember. And after two, two weeks my father came back home with mine uncle. Many changes started happening. I remember I saw many people laying on the ground in Sosnowiec and I couldn't understand what's happen. I never saw things like that. And so I asked my mother what it is and she explained to me it's all killed and explained the nicest way she could to me. But you know children, they take in the way you explain to them everything and gradually everything started happening. We had to close up the shops. We had to prepare to go to the ghetto, the Srodula [Ger: Schrodula] and I remember that our, that they were attacking people on the streets, young ladies, and they told them to dig graves. And later, they told them to take off clothes and they shot through the breast. .(PAUSE) Sorry. And tell them to dig the graves, and the graves were still being, you know, I just don't know how to express myself. The people are still alive there. This is before we were going to Srodula. And I, we had a - I'm going to tell you about a young man who was extremely brave, and nobody talks about him. His name was Marek Lieberman. He was beautiful, blonde with blue eyes. Extremely good to people. A very wealthy person, helping everybody. Didn't care who you are or what you are. And somebody announce some about him. They came to the house, knock on the wall and took all the money. And we were called to come to the market, and he was hung. I was five feet away from him, and it's engraved in my mind. I can't forget it. It's always with me. People should know about it. His name was Marek Lieberman. And in the same time, his wife give birth to a baby; and I was sent out to check, I don't know where, but this was our talking in the city, and this stays with me. And I saw other incidents too. But this happened later.</p></p></dialogue>

You got, when, do you want me to tell you about the rest. When we were going, when we were going...this was in, in 1943, I don't remember which day. It was June, but I don't remember which day it was. I was standing in the line. The Germans were standing withus (tortures) tortures, yes, and the mother was standing with her daughter and she said something to her daughter and the German soldiers, soldier came, came, came toward them and hit the little girl and the mother was protecting the child. You know, she took her in her arms and he took a gun and shot her. . How can you erase something like <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> camps, and I didn't...you know, when you are with your parents, it doesn't matter how bad it is. But if you still have somebody who loves you, cares about you, who look after you, even if you don't have nothing to eat, even when you don't have, when you live three or four families in two rooms, you know there's somebody there who will protect you. So when you're a child you don't pay much attention. You play hop...hop scotch, you go to, I mean, there were no schools, but we had little classes. People were teaching us. People, all the people were getting together, having meetings until somebody talk about them, tell the Germans; then when they start, because the ghetto was closed and they were watching us.</p><p>Mine dad could go back to Sosnowiec everyday to work. My mother was in the ghetto with us children. I just had one little brother. Mine uncles, mine uncles, the Germans took them right away to a place and...I forgot how they called the place and I remember they were, they were hitting on the head of mine uncles. I know, because I went there because I was a little kid. I could run around every where. They didn't know who I was. They didn't caught me, so I just saw what's happening and report it at home. But they could not get them out. And they send them out to I know, they killed them right away there. Two of mine uncles. And one uncle they sent right away to a concentration camp. Many things coming back to me. I didn't thought...for many, many years I couldn't. (I'm sorry.)

And I remember at night I had to come back home, going to the cemetery by myself. But I wasn't scared. I was singing, and my father was waiting on the other corner for me. I remember good, I remember good things too, because people were getting together. People were caring about each other. We didn't have much, because they took everything away from us. When then came to Poland, right away they took, they came to the houses, and you know, they confiscate everything. I remember when they came to mine house; and uh my grandmother give my mother a silver something, silver tea and coffee set. And they took it away. And my mother went, she didn't allow them. And my father said, "Give it to them. I will get you new ones when, God permit, we leave here alive." Back of my mind too. Just a little thing, but when we went to...when we went to Srodula, to the ghetto, just allowed to take so much and so much. Just a few pounds. And <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> three or four families lived in two rooms. We had three families living in one room. I remember my father was singing to me at night.

And I went. And she went with mine brother. And it was whole place with young girls, with young people; and I remember the Germans said to me, in German, "[Eine puppe sehr giit (ph)]." They're going to be very good to us. We're going to have a wonderful time, all of us. And uh right from there they put us in those cattle wagons; and they picked up other people on the way from other cities, and it was horrible. I'm still...I still don't like to go by trains.

I don't know if we were gone three days or four days. I don't remember. People...people were dying. Holding hands, and just holding...holding hands. And we came to Klettendorf--no, we came to [Guntebrecher (ph)], to Germany; and I remember they let us out, like you know, when you sit so many days, when you stand and you can move. And the Germans, the Germans was screaming and beating us with the guns and with those, with those...those.... I don't know how you call it, they keep them in , yes, clubs ?. And it was just..(DISRUPTION) And I remember when we came to Guentherbriicke," this was our first arbeit __, arbeit lager; which was bad too, but it was not like our death. And there were already some people and they were just giving us work right away then. And so many people, most of the people were very sick. They couldn't go to work.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I met uh...you know, when you go, when young people go together, you just start talking to each other, and you meet. And I knew all of them. But came people from other cities; and there were two ladies who knew my mother when she was a young girl. Their name was Kaufman (ph). And uh I just met them, and I didn't know that they knew my mother; but I was just going to everybody, and I was just touching and thanking and introducing myself.</p><p>And they said to me, "Your mother, we worked with her." And so was a friendship, and so I knew right away somebody.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What kind of work did you do?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: When I came to Klettendorf, when I was doing...I was working with a shovel and uh, a laborer. Very hard work.

And I was dancing, and tap dancing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What were the living conditions like in the camp?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: What conditions? We were existing, not even existing. We, the food - I remember I took a piece of bread, a tiny piece of bread, and I took it to a lady. And I said to her, "Cut in very thin...very thin slices." So I would have it for a long time. And uh later I, I got a better job. I mean they sent me to put boxes together. We called it Sentung (ph), sending ammunition and things to other cities. And I had to put it together. And I was singing...I remember my father was singing German songs; and I knew a few, and I was singing. And there was one German <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> who was...he said, "How do you know those songs?" I said, "Because my father was singing." And uh he like it so much he gave me a piece of bread.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can you sing one of the songs for us?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, I can't sing, I can't sing. And uh later, I was sent out from this concentration camp to another one, to Klettendorf. In Klettendorf...let me think a minute. In Klettendorf, for me was a man's concentration camp and a woman's concentration camp. And in Klettendorf when it was, I...[ became sick. I mean, I didn't have...I was malnutritious, and I was working very hard. And I was working, and uh I was a mechanic. I was supposed to be on mechanic.</p><p>The German who had the place wanted me to repair a car. What do I know about a car? So he took a piece of iron and put it on my coat. He's going to kill. And was there another German who said, " -" You know, "Leave her alone. She doesn't know how to repair a car." So he said something to him in German. But he didn't do anything to me, because the other one was a soldier. So he...and I told this when I came home, you know, to...to the barracks, to my , to the lady who took us to take care of us. So she <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> of me. He said for me to stay on the hot water, and when I felt...she took a razor blade because we didn't have any scalpels, and she cut me under my arm and she let the pus out and my whole body was.... And I was fainting; and she...somehow she took care of me. She said, she told me...I didn't know this because I didn't know then, but then I met her in 19...I mean, I met her ten or fifteen years ago in New York at a wedding. She was telling my husband that she was nursing with me with little spoons with water, because we didn't have much to eat. And everybody contribute. All the guys were very supportive, helping each other. You know, everybody give something away, they don't have much; and this helped me back to life. And I was screaming, "I have to be alive because I have to go home." I knew that I didn't have anybody, but I was hoping so hard that I believe in it. And when I come home, I'm going to have a mother and a father. And that's what I told everybody. And everybody agreed with me. Nobody disagreed, and everybody said, "Of course, you will." I mean, the doctors didn't have to do anything. They just talked to you and told you, and you believed them. Maybe this will help you.</p></p></dialogue>

But with the ghetto together, it was--the whole war, six years. You know, sometimes I sit and I don't believe it myself. But it's the truth.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can you tell us more about the relationship between the young women together in the camp?</p></p></dialogue>

These are Klara Kartush (ph) in Detroit, Tonya, Tonya...I forget her maiden name--Jablon (ph). And Sara Stapler(ph).</p><p>Those girls were wonderful. They even took care of me when I was very sick. Because they had a transport they sent out in 19...in 1945, before the war ended, they sent a transport of girls. I couldn't go because I was very sick. So they left me; and those girls didn't go. They said, "We're going to save you." | didn't want to ask. They said, "You have to lie down, because we're going...we're going close the whole lager." But what happened...the good thing happened that the Russians came the night before, and we were liberated the 8th of May.</p><p>And they were supposed to kill us the 9th. Get rid of us. And you know, we were scared to tell them that we are sick because doesn't matter what. Right away, dead.

"We're going to teach, you're going to go back to school." And I was very eager to do this. So three weeks later, I went back to Poland without papers, with nothing. I went back to Sosnowiec. Hoping, hoping that I have somebody there. Can you imagine, I was sitting in the train...I was sitting with a priest with some girls. And I remember I didn't have anywhere to put mine head, so I put on his knee; and when he started talking about the Jews, I picked up mine head and said, "I'm Jewish.</p><p>And I'm . I'm Jewish and I'm coming from concentration camp." And I said, "You better close your mouth, because you don't know what you're talking about." He got up...he throw me down, and he got up and went away. Coming back from...to Sosnowiec, I didn't have any money. | didn't have any baggage. I just had whatever I was wearing. Mine heart was pumping. I was overwhelmed. I was very happy; but I was excited and I was happy and I was scared and I didn't trust. I was afraid to trust. And I went back when my cousin wrote me the letter to the factory there. Was one of mine cousins and the people working. And he said to me, "This is yours. And stay with me, and we will take care of you." Didn't say anything about a school, what he wrote to me. And I stayed a week. I stayed two weeks. I was, I was going around.
