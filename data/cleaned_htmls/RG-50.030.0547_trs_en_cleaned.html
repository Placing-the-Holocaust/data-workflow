My father later on, and maybe that's what he did early on, was in the hosiery and socks and so on.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, you don't know your father's business when he -- you know, you don't know how he made a living when you were born?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Before -- no, no, I do not know. Never talked about it. And the problem is, I never asked questions. You know, children, we didn't ask questions. We had a nice --I was dressed very nicely, everything was fine. So when I saw the pictures, and they were still alive, and I just looked at the picture, oh how nice. But I never asked any questions. I was -- I was a child, I just did what had to be done and I listened.</p><p>And when the time came that I had to go into hiding, I don't know if I asked why, but they always -- I think they just gave a story, well, you're gonna stay with -- should I say the name?

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Four and a half.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, cause this is the time, that picture that I showed you, just a little after that is July 1942, we had to go into hiding.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, what you learn about the -- the background to going into hiding is everything from what is to -- had been told to you later, okay, is that correct, yeah?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And you remembered being brought there, and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh yes, and I remember crying after them leaving, and they were crying and -- and I ran after them.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Those are the memories I -- I really have so strongly.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Well, that's not surprising, in a -- in a way, because for a child it's so traumatic, when you already know who your mother and your father is --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And then -- and that -- you've never known what it's like to not have them.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: To -- in my eyes, they were older, and they probably were in their maybe late 30s, early 40s. They were old people, because my parents were so much younger.</p><p>Cause my father -- my mother was born in 1912, 1912, and my mother was born in 1911.
