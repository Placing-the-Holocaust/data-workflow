<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My name is Judah Nadich.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: OK. And where and when were you born?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was born in the city of Baltimore on May 13, 1912.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And what was your uh position, please?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I'm, what positions I had uh (as a rabbi) as a rabbi? I, my first pulpit was in uh the city of Buffalo, New York, Temple Beth David. From there I went to Chicago where I was co-rabbi with the distinguished Rabbi Solomon Goldman at the Synagogue. Uh in Chicago I enlisted in the Army. After the war I worked briefly for the JDC and the UJA, about a year and a half. And then resuming my rabbinic career, I went to uh Israel in Brookline where I served for ten years, and then I came to New York, where I was rabbi of the Park Avenue Synagogue from 1957 to 1987.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Thank you. Let's go back a little bit...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Incidentally, I want to tell you I wasn't fired in 1987. I retired.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: OK. (laughter). That's just fine. Uh tell mea little bit, where did you go to school?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>Where, how did you, how did you get into the rabbi ?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, when I was fourteen years old I received a scholarship from the Baltimore</p><p> Torah where I had been studying to take me to the Yeshiva in New York, then on the Lower East Side. Subsequently it came to be known as Yeshiva University. I was in the student body when we moved uptown to Washington Heights, where the Yeshiva University is presently located. I studied in the Yeshiva for five and a half years, graduating first from its high school.</p><p>Later going to uh the College of the City of New York, at night and to Johns Hopkins during the summers and after uh studying at the Yeshiva for a period of five and a half years, I have been graduated also from college, I entered the Jewish Theological Seminary of America where I was ordained a rabbi in 1936, and at the same time that I went to the Seminary I went to Columbia.</p><p>Got my Master's in the Department of History, studying under Baron (ph) and in 1936 I got my Master's Degree from Columbia as well. Subsequently I earned uh a Doctorate of uh Hebrew Literature from the Seminary and a Doctor of Divinity 5 <span class="page-break" number="0"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Ah, well, uh I was uh serving as a rabbi in Chicago at the time of Pearl Harbor. And I recall listening to the radio on December the 7th, 1941, and hearing that the Japanese had bombed Pearl Harbor, and I knew instinctively that I wanted to be a part of what was going to happen. We had been reading in the press uh about Kristallnacht some time before, not too long before, and we knew that uh there, there was some kind of persecution against the Jews under the, the Nazis, so I felt sure, that I wanted to enlist as a chaplain. And enlist I did not long, after Pearl Harbor, and I was uh admitted to the Army in Chicago and ordered to report at uh Fort Bragg in North Carolina on uh May the 2nd, 1942.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: OK. Tell me about those first weeks at Fort Bragg.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, they were I suppose I should say difficult weeks for a person who had never known anything about the military. My father hadn't even allowed me to be a Boy Scout because he was afraid I might like, I might like military things and uh get to like to wearing a uniform and marching. Uh my father you can see was uh a pacifist and indeed uh he was more than that. He was a member of the , and that was the first Jewish school that I <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We landed in Liverpool. I reported as I had been instructed to do at Cheltham (ph) which was our service of supply headquarters, and after a day or two in Cheltham and going through the uh routine, the red tape, I was assigned to the northern, the northern Ireland Bay Section which was located just outside the city of Belfast. The reason for my being sent there, since I was the first Jewish chaplain ordered to the European theater, was because our first American troops were stationed in Northern Ireland, and an armored headquarters, a corps headquarters, and uh two infantry divisions, and I immediately began visiting every camp, every military camp to search out Jewish soldiers and officers, and to arrange for services and for whatever, whatever other service I could render to the soldiers of Jewish faith.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You had told me at lunch something about the particular way in which you solved a burial...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yes, oh yes. As a matter of fact the immediate reason for the uh request by General Eisenhower for a, an American Army Jewish chaplain to be dispatched immediately to the European theater, was because there was some kind of a problem that could have become a uh cause-celebre. Uh a Jewish soldier had had been killed in a uh motor, Army motor motor vehicle accident and since there was no American Army Jewish chaplain at the time, the uh rabbi in Belfast, Rabbi , was asked whether he would officiate at the funeral service, the burial <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> carved up England into various slices so that I would be able to visit each area once a month. In each Army headquarters or hospital, I would find a Jewish officer or non-commissioned officer or private who would know how to conduct a Jewish service, give him prayer books and other religious supplies, have him conduct the services each week, but I would show up once a month to uh be of help, to conduct a monthly service, and to help with any problems that might arise.</p><p>As more Jewish chaplains arrived in the United Kingdom, I would assign them to take parts of England or, and Scotland, and thus my own territory would be decreased as time went on. But I went as far as Glasgow and again to Belfast, and in all parts of England and to some parts of Wales.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How long did this go on?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Uh this uh continued for about a year while I was stationed in Surry, near London, and then for the second year I was stationed in London proper uh at American Army Headquarters uh in London uh at uh at or near Grosvenor (ph) Square.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And what did you do from a</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And there I was uh a chaplain in the office of the theater chaplain, who was a Roman Catholic monsignor, . His deputy was an Episcopalian chaplain, Edwin Carter, <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> uh in the process I lost a brand new officer's trench coat that I had just purchased in London before departure for France.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You took up duties in Paris. What was your role in Paris? What was your title and what was your role?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Ah, in in Paris I was uh, my title was Deputy to the Theater Chaplain. Not the senior deputy. That was still Nick Carter. But I was deputy to the senior chaplain in the theater to the theater chaplain, Father Terrnand (ph) for Jewish affairs, so that when a new Jewish chaplain would arrive from the States, I was to assign him to his new location. Uh I was still uh G3, distributing religious supplies, and I was a Jewish chaplain at that time, in the beginning the only Jewish chaplain uh in the area, and of course we moved uh after the breakthrough at St. Lowe (ph) we moved into Paris as Paris was captured. In Paris | first met with the the survivors in Paris. Uh and uh my position there was to be of immediate help to the survivors because for most of them I was the first contact they had with the Jewish community outside. And I was a signal to them that uh the American Jewish community was there, at least in the person of this one rabbi, this one chaplain.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can you describe it? Describe your first meeting with a, with the group of survivors?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Uh, my first meeting with the survivors happened in a rather interesting way. I uh took a jeep and drove to the area where I had been told Jews had been living, the area known as the</p><p> , the little place. And I flew my Jewish chaplain's flag from the jeep. Uh you may <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> channels, and I was cabled from the JDC but through the Jewish Welfare Board which was the only organization set up to deal with American Army Jewish chaplains. Through the JWB I received $10,000 from the JDC. That $10,000 was used by this committee of Jews in France to open the first soup kitchens in Paris and to start the first Jewish free loan society that would enable uh small Jewish shop keepers and artisans to start up work again. Uh that uh didn't end my uh relationship with the Jews who had survived. I met with the committee very often, until the JDC opened its own headquarters on the Rue de in Paris uh but throughout my year <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> must have returned. That they were surrounding the cemetery. That their target was General DeGaulle, and incidentally anybody else who was there. And therefore all of the shooting. And I quickly dodged behind a tall monument, and a little bo...little French boy ran past me. I grabbed him and pulled him down beside me. He had become separated from his mother. He was crying, and I held him near me all throughout the uh shooting. When it suddenly got quiet again, all of us left the cemetery quickly. It was only the next day that I learned through the French press that what had happened was that on the railroad tracks just outside the cemetery, the Germans had left two carloads of ammunition, shells, bullets of all description, and spontaneous combustion had started this tremendous racket of all the bullets and shells being fired and uh we were just very fortunate that uh we weren't killed. I never got to give my uh carefully prepared talk in French.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What else were you doing in Paris at that time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh, uh I must tell you of something in which I took great pleasure. I, I mentioned earlier that I was in charge of all religious supplies for the American Army on the continent of Europe. And months before Passover I realized that we would need matzo (ph) for the American Jewish troops. And when I went to the Quartermaster General he informed me of course as ...</p><p>END OF TAPE ...that but that uh if I could locate a matzoth factory in England I could order as much matzo as I wanted, that it would be charged on reverse-lend-lease, and he added since the British are not going to pay us in total (ph) anyhow, order as much matzo as you want. We'll charge it to reverse-lend-lease and the British will pay for it. I took him at his word. I gave that English matzo factory that I had discovered the largest order it had ever received. When the matzo came sailing across the Channel to Paris to me, it filled an entire liberty ship, which rode high in the waters of the English Channel and the matzo was delivered to Paris. I distributed it to all of the Jewish chaplains then serving with the American Army for further distribution to American Jewish troops, for the various Passover that would be held. Incidentally I held my Passover Seder for six thousand troops in the Lido in Paris, on the Champs d'Elysee, the largest nightclub in Paris, an odd place to have a seder but it worked out very well. No nightclub acts but a seder each night for three thousand soldiers, three thousand the first night, three thousand the second night of Passover. But I had a great deal of matzo left over, so I distributed it first to the Jews of Paris and I gave matzo to the Jewish chaplains with the free French troops, the free Czech soldiers, the free Polish Army, and distributed the rest of the matzo to Jewish civilians in France and Belgium because food, bread in part...in particular, was not easy to purchase. It couldn't be found in in any great measure, and matzo could be eaten not only during the eight days of Passover of course, but throughout the year. So that was my big order of matzo, and its distribution. Further when came and there was a need for and for <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> (SHORT PAUSE)</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: OK. You were in France for quite a while.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was in France for a year. (Um-hum) And I traveled incidentally to uh all parts of northern France, Belgium, and eastern France to meet with the Jewish chaplains, particularly those serving with the uh front line infantry and armored force divisions.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What did you see as you traveled in the way of survivors, Jewish survivors, in France?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, uh interestingly enough, in a number of French communities, small groups of Jews returned and the American Army Jewish chaplains did an extraordinary piece of work in helping them. Uh I think of Chaplain, the late Chaplain Isaac Kline (ph) in and many <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> large supply that filled several warehouses in Paris of prisoner of war parcels that had been sent from the United States during the war that were to be shipped to Switzerland. From there the International Red Cross would send them to American prisoners of war in Germany. Now these parcels were full of food of high quality and they, they were particularly chosen kinds of food for the nutrition that they would provide to those who would eat them. The war had just been ended in Europe, and the American prisoners of war had been transhipped to French ports and had been sent back home. Uh this food was still in the warehouses in Paris, was appearing in the French black market--in other words the parcels were being stolen from the warehouses and uh this uh American officer said to me if you go to the Quartermaster General and ask for these parcels for the prisoners of war, they might be given to you. I followed his advice. I went to the Quartermaster General. I told him there was need to send uh to ship uh uh Jewish survivors from one place to another without mentioning any particular locations. He wasn't interested in asking which locations. I said to him I know that there are these prison of war parcels that soon will rot, that are showing up in the French black market. Would he sign papers enabling me to take control of those prisoner of war parcels? He was relieved to get rid of the headache and he said just make out the orders and I shall sign them, five copies. He made out the orders and for the next several days, trucks of the Brichah were moving these prisoner of war parcels from the warehouses, the several warehouses in Paris, to their own channels for shipment ultimately to southern French ports to go on so- called illegal ships to Palestine. By the way, there were a number of American Army Jewish chaplains who helped the Brichah in similar fashion. There were those who obtained medical supplies for these ships. There were those who even obtained ammunition to be taken aboard the ships. Indeed wherever there were Jewish chaplains stationed in France, if they were contacted by the men or women of the Brichah, they found ways of helping the members of the Brichah.</p><p>TECHNICAL CONVERSATION</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Uh how did the Brichah get their trucks? Do you know?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I'm not uh privy to that information. I really can't answer that. I don't know whether they bought them. They did have certain funds. They could have bought them. Uh trucks were not too hard I imagine because gasoline was still rationed. When there's rationing of gasoline and gasoline is difficult to obtain and it's very expensive, people who own trucks are not so anxious to use them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you help the Brichah in any other way at this time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Ah yes. I helped the Brichah later on after I was ordered to Germany to American Army Headquarters in Frankfurt.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: OK. Let's talk about Frankfurt, uh unless there's something else you want to add about France.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: About France? No, not necessarily. (OK. What...) Oh yes, I, there is. I must tell you that uh I made a number of friends among Jewish survivors in Paris. I was invited to preach in uh several synagogues during the High Holy Days and uh during the festivals and on different</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And thus I got to know a number of them, and my friendship with several of them has continued to this day. They have visited America and I and my children have visited them in France. And similarly with friends among British Jews in London.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did you get, why did you go from France to Frankfurt, Germany?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, after a year in Paris I received orders commanding me to go to American Army Headquarters in Frankfurt. And to report for duties as an advisor to the Commanding General uh dash, General Eisenhower, dash, uh to advise him on Jewish affairs. And uh I flew from Paris to uh, no--I didn't fly. I took the American military train which was an overnight train that ran between Paris and Frankfurt. Paris was our rear headquarters. Frankfurt was our forward headquarters. So I went by train overnight to Frankfurt.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: OK. Can you give me a little bit of background about uh suddenly being appointed an advisor?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: As to why this came to be?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did this come to be?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: This was, that's uh a question of interest because uh there was no such position ever before uh in the American Army or indeed in any other army. An advisor to a commanding general with regard to Jewish problems. And there, it's interesting as to how it came to pass.</p><p>The war, American war correspondents had reported during the summer of 1945, and their reports were read by Americans in New York, Chicago, elsewhere, in the in the daily press, that Jewish survivors of the concentration camps in Germany and Austria were being badly treated.</p><p>And as a result President Truman appointed uh Dean Earl G. Harrison who was Dean of the Law School of the University of Pennsylvania, to make an inspection trip. He came in July of 1945.</p><p>His aid was Dr. Joseph J. Schwartz fortunately. He was the very able European director of the Joint Distribution Committee. And when Dean Harrison returned to the United States toward the end of July, he made a report that was highly critical of the American Army uh in Germany and of the manner in which they were taking care of Jewish survivors. And at the beginning of August there was a Zionist conference held in London, the first such conference since the last world Zionist conference of 1939. This was uh the beginning of August 1945. Uh several of us chaplains were lucky enough to get to London to attend that Zionist conference and we told the delegates, particularly I remember Rabbi Stephen S. Weiss (ph) of what we had seen in Germany and uh Dr. Weiss, uh at the suggestion of one of the chaplains, the late Rabbi Robert Marcus (ph), uh sent a dispatch through the American Embassy in London to General Eisenhower, suggesting the appointment of a Jewish chaplain as a liaison officer to coordinate the work being done to help the Jewish survivors in Germany. Uh General Eisenhower two days later replied to Rabbi Weiss on the 9th of August that uh he did not agree with the suggestion, that uh there could be no appointment of a Jewish liaison officer because liaison officers were at his headquarters representing various nations. There was a French liaison officer. There was a Polish liaison officer. A Czech liaison officer. But there couldn't be a reli...a religious liaison officer. Well, uh Gen...General Eisenhower had already received from General Marshall, the</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 1 Chief of Staff, several days before this a communication telling him that the report of Dean Earl G. Harrison was very critical of the American Army in Germany but on the 10th of August, the day after Eisenhower had replied to Rabbi Weiss, he received a cable from Secretary of War Stimpson telling him that the report of Dean Harrison severely condemned the American Army, that something had to be done. General Eisenhower, the very same day, replied to Secretary of War Stimpson that only yesterday he had turned down the suggestion to appoint a Jewish liaison officer. Now he was going to appoint a chaplain, an Army chaplain, to advise him and to coordinate whatever was being done to help Jewish survivors who had been found in the German concentration camps. So that's how the position came to be created. And that's why I got the orders in Paris to proceed during the third week of August at all full speed to Frankfurt.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What did you find when you arrived in Frankfurt?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, uh I uh I found that the Army had planned uh fully as to what to do with any survivors who might be found in German concentration camps. There had been set up a combined displaced persons executive, which was a large office staffed by a number of officers.</p><p>There was a general who was in charge, General Nicholson. Uh this combined DP executive was under the general command of uh the G5 on General Eisenhower's staff, General Adcock (ph), and they were doing a good job in following the plans that had been prepared a long time before. Those plans said simply that the survivors found in German concentration camps should be quickly sent back to the lands of their origin. And indeed French and, and Belgian and Greek and other nationals found in the concentration camps within ninety days were sent back to their homelands. But what the planners had not thought of was number one there would be German Jews and Austrian Jews and Hungarian Jews who came from countries that were considered enemy countries by the American Army, so they were enemy nationalists, and nobody had planned for enemy nationalists to be found in the concentration camps. The irony was that the Germans, the Hungarians, uh the Austrians had deprived these Jews of their German, Austrian, Hungarian citizenship, but now they were given that citizenship again because to do otherwise would be to follow the practice of of the Nazis. And so they were enemy nationalists. That was one problem. The second problem was, and this was a far greater problem, the planners, the military planners had never contemplated the possibility that there would be survivors who were, who would be Jews who would refuse to return to the lands of their origin. Polish Jews. Ukrainian Jews. Lithuanian, Estonian Jews. Uh Hungarian Jews. Romanian Jews. Because they knew that their homes, their businesses that they once had had in their lands of origin had been seized by their erstwhile neighbors. They knew also that in many cases their former non-Jewish neighbors had cooperated with the Nazis in turning in their Jewish neighbors. Indeed in helping the Nazis ship their Jewish neighbors to death camps. They knew that it would be dangerous even to return to the lands of their origin. They were concerned less their neighbors now in possession of Jewish homes and businesses attack them, as indeed happened. Moreover, psychologically these Jews, survivors of German concentration camps, knew that the very land, the very soil where they had once lived was now a soil that absorbed the blood of their children and their parents and their spouses. That the very air was polluted with the smoke of the crematoria where Jews had been burned. They had no desire to return to the lands from which they had come. Now it was the problems of these Jews in particular that had not been thought of in advance. Therefore the Army indeed did not take care properly of these Jewish survivors. It</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 2 wasn't until the 22nd of August when General Eisenhower issued an order that the Army take care of these survivors and that so-called enemy nationals who were Jewish and who had suffered under the Nazis should be taken care of as victims of the Nazis, that the whole situation was turned around. And a part of that turning around of the situation involved my being ordered to take on the duties of visiting these camps, seeing what the conditions were, bringing back my reports to General Eisenhower or in his absence to his Chief of Staff, General Walter Beetle Smith. And to recommend changes in whatever conditions had to be changed.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: At this point we're going to break and change tapes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Fine.</p><p>END OF TAPE</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: OK. Uh we've begun. You were, you have been assigned to Eisenhower and you have arrived. Uh can you tell me, what was your first assignment?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, my first assignment was to meet of course with the uh uh officers who were the staff of the combined displaced persons executive. And I spent oh the better part of a week uh learning what my job was to, to consist of. I read through a lot of uh files and I had long discussions uh with uh the several officers who were a part of the combined DP executive and then I uh compiled for myself a list of questions that would be a questionnaire for me when I would arrive in a displaced persons camp. The questions would have to do with uh housing, food, sanitary conditions, medical conditions, health of people and uh the like and where did these people want to go. What did they see as the solution, the ultimate solution to their problems. So armed with this questionnaire, I started off on my first tour. And I went first to Bavaria uh then under the command of the 3"! Army, whose commanding general was General George Patton. And uh General Patton had appointed a Major Schaffer (ph) as his displaced persons officer on his staff in Munich, which was the headquarters of the 3rd Army. Well, I went to Bavaria and I headed first for Feldafing (ph). Now why Feldafing? Because in the report of Dean Harrison, Feldafing had been praised. Indeed uh Dean Harrison had stated that Feldafing should be the model for other DP camps in the American zone of Germany. I went to Feldafing. I found uh over five thousand Jews there and the Army contingent in charge was headed by a Lieutenant Irving Smith. Now Irving Smith was a very able and efficient Army officer. He was Jewish. He was sympathetic to the plight of the survivors. And yet the Jews of the camp voiced to me through a committee whom they had chosen, their complaints about Lieutenant Smith. Why? Well, because he issued orders without consulting with the committee.</p><p>He, well that that was his job. He was an Army officer. And he wasn't trained to be in charge of a group of civilians in dire need. But as I went around through the camp with the committee, the Jewish committee, I was appalled by what I had seen. Why was I so upset? Because Feldafing, which had been held up by Dean Harrison as the model camp, was severely over-crowded.</p><p>There were uh a number of, of uh barracks that were completely unfit for human habitation. The barracks were in many cases uh housing with poor roofing so that whenever it rained everything inside would get wet. Certainly as I thought of the coming winter, people couldn't be housed in, under such conditions. In addition, there was severe crowding in all of the barracks where the Jews were living. Remember, this was not a concentration camp. The Jews had been moved out</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Many of them were brought by the Germans as slave labor to work in German industry while the Germans themselves were in the German Army. Some had volunteered to come because of their sympathy with the Germans. Well, now these foreign workers were also displaced persons. They claimed the status of displaced persons. And their housing that had been used for them was now being used by Jewish displaced persons. And I thought the conditions in, in Feldafing were deplorable. And I wondered how bad could the conditions be elsewhere if Feldafing had been praised by Dean Harrison as a model DP camp. I found out why Harrison praised Feldafing, and that was because Feldafing at that time was almost unique in that it was an all-Jewish camp. Now other camps where Jewish survivors were being housed were camps where non-Jews were also being housed. Who were these non-Jews? They were the foreign workers I mentioned a moment ago. In many cases they were sympathetic to the Jews, but in most cases they were anti-Jewish. Many of them were, had been sympathetic to the Nazi cause, had volunteered to come as workers to Germany. Moreover they had been fed well and housed well and clothed well, all through the years of the war and what the Jewish survivors of concentration camps required was not what they needed. And to give the Jews in the camps where they were housed with the non-Jews special treatment, more food than the others got, better clothing than the others had gotten, more medical attention than the others received, would be unthinkable. It would, it could create riots, that the Jews were getting special treatment.</p><p>Never mind that the Jews needed the special attention. It was the Jews who had suffered under the Nazi severely in the concentration camps, not the foreign workers. But it was an impossible situation. So what Dean Harrison had recommended was that camps should be set up with Feldafing as a model, that is they should be all Jewish camps and they should have a Jewish committee who would work together with whoever was in charge of the camps, whether it would be uh a military group or an company or workers from the Joint Distribution Committee <span class="page-break" number="12"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 4 camps would get passes enabling them to leave the camp for a certain number of hours. The Jews in the camps looked out and saw Germans who were, were the enemies of the Americans, Germans who had placed them in concentration camps, walking freely on the roads, on the highways. They were not behind barbed wire. They didn't have, have to ask anybody for a pass to walk around freely. They, the Jews, who had been so severely treated by the Germans, were still behind barbed wire and had to ask for permission to have a few hours of freedom outside the DP camp. Well, uh I must say that uh General Eisenhower acted quickly on all these recommendations. Orders were done quickly to General Patton to correct these situations and I had a uh vivid illustration of how at least in one instance if not in others, the orders were not carried out by General Patton. Generally speaking, had Eisenhower's orders beginning with his August 22nd initial order correcting the situation been carried out on all the lower levels of command, the situation for Jewish survivors in Germany would have changed radically quickly.</p><p>Unfortunately there was a wide gap between the headquarters in Frankfurt and the military units dealing with the Jewish displaced persons, and with all the intermediary levels through which the orders had to pass, including General Patton's headquarters in Munich. And so, for example, when I went back again on my second trip to Bavaria, the Jews complained to me that the barbed wire still existed. The pass system had not been changed, and when I came back to Frankfurt, I reported that to General Walter Beetle Smith. Soon afterwards I came into the anteroom to General Eisenhower Eisen-uh-hower's headquarters, to his office, and I saw General Patton sitting in the anteroom at eight o'clock in the morning when the Army day began in Germany, and I knew that I must be the reason for his being there. I had reported that he had not carried out Eisenhower's order with regard to the removal of the pass system and the barbed wire. I saw him sitting there with his pearl-handled pistols, one on each side of him, with his shiny helmet and boots. He glared at me with distaste and I beat a quick diplomatic retreat out of the office.</p><p>Later General Smith told me that what had happened was that when he had reported to Eisenhower that I had said that Patton had not carried out the orders about the removal of the barbed wire and the pass system, Eisenhower had instructed General Smith to call General Patton to have him report the following morning at eight o'clock. General Patton had to ride overnight from Munich to Frankfurt to be there at eight o'clock in the morning, and later when General Eisenhower saw him, General Eisenhower said to Patton after reminding him of the barbed wire and the pass system and his not carrying out Eisenhower's orders with regard to them, General Eisenhower asked him, George, why don't you do something for these Jews? And General Patton replied thinking that he was talking to his buddy, his close friend with whom he had gone to school at West Point, he replied uh Eisenhower, in a jocular way, well, why the hell should I. And Eisenhower lost his temper, which he normally kept under control, and retorted, well, God damn it, if for no other reason than because I have ordered you to. Now shortly after that General Patton was relieved of command of the 3rd Army and was given the command of the 15th Army, with headquarters at Bad Nauheim (ph). I don't know why that happened, but the 15th Army was only a paper Army. It consisted of no troops, only of the headquarters. The general story as uh told by newspaper correspondents, the war correspondents and by the movie about General Patton, was that he had slapped a soldier in a military hospital in Sicily, charging him with malingering. But the question asks itself, why should Eisenhower have waited so long to punish Patton for something that had happened a long time before. I'm not saying that this incident of the barbed wire and pass system were the immediate cause of Patton's demotion, but I'm guessing that it may have played some part in it.</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Did you have contact again with the Brichah during this period to help you at all?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I had contact with Brichah. I found them in various places in Germany and later when I went into the American zone of Austria and I soon gradually came to be a kind of a communications factor in their operations. Scattered as they were in different areas of Germany and Austria, it was very difficult for them to communicate with each other. It was impossible for them to give reports to a representative of the Jewish agency in London. At this particular time is was Mosha (ph) , later Mosha (ph) . But I was situated at American Army headquarters in Frankfurt, and I could communicate by telephone with all parts of Europe, so that I could speak to in London and to various members of Brichah in different parts of Germany or Austria, and bring reports from the Brichah men and women to and his requests to the members of Brichah, so that I played a small role there uh acting as a kind of uha communications headquarters for Brichah. Of course I continued on my rounds of the DP camps regularly, week in, week out. Not only in Bavaria but in all other parts of the American zone of Germany, and at this time too, I had the good fortune of welcoming a delegation of Jewish survivors from Bergen-Belsen in the British zone of Germany. Uh they came to meet with me to find out what was happening in the American zone of Germany with survivors, to tell me what was happening in Bergen-Belsen under the British zone, and among them I remember was Rosen and the lady , a physician who was later to become his wife, and <span class="page-break" number="14"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 6 chaplains to arrive in that batch of thirty who arrived after the war was actually over. Chaplain Elia Bonen (ph) who had been with uh the 42nd Rainbow Division that had liberated Dachau, had helped as much as possible while his troops were still in the area of Dachau, but he telephoned me to say he was moving on from Dachau with his troops to Salzburg in Austria, and that I should send somebody to help the Jewish survivors in Dachau. Chaplain uh Abe Klossner had just arrived. I had nowhere really to send him so I ordered him for thirty days to the American field hospital that was remaining in Dachau. When the theater chaplain learned of what I had done, that I had not at the end of thirty days seen to it that Chaplain Klossner should be ordered to another military unit elsewhere, threatened to have me court martialed uh but fortunately I talked my way out of it.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: How did I talk myself out of it? By fast talk and also because by this time I had been greatly involved--I was still in Paris at the time (c) I had been greatly involved in service to the Jewish survivors in Paris, to Jewish lay leaders in Paris, and he might have been just a little bit afraid to court martial a chaplain on his staff who had contacts, he knew, not only with civilians in Paris but with the Jewish community back in New York, with the heads of the Jewish Welfare Board and the Joint Distribution Committee. There might have been a row created had he done it, so he thought the better of it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can you (cough), sorry, can you talk a little bit about, you've had these relations with Brichah. You're working with the Army. To what extent did the Army turn a blind eye to what you and the Brichah were doing about making sure that supplies got through, etc.?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Ah that's very interesting. I told you already about the Quartermaster General in Paris who did not ask questions he might have asked as to how many displaced persons were moving, where were they moving from, where were they moving to he didn't ask the questions. In addition, when Jewish chaplains obtained medical supplies and sanitation supplies and even ammunition for the Brichah, it was with the cooperation usually of their military superiors.</p><p>When uh I met General Hume in Austria, and on behalf of the Brichah I asked him where would be a good place for survivors to cross the border. He said this is altogether unofficial and if you are ever asked, you never heard it from me, but he took me to the wall map and he showed me a point where it would be a good place to cross the border. Incidentally, he gave me an article that was printed as a brochure that he had written some years before, of Moses as the first great military commander who took care of medical and sanitation requirements for an army on the march. And it was quite a learned article that he had written, long before World War Two had started. He gave me a copy that I treasure to this day. Now later on, there is a similar story in connection with what happened in Vienna. When I came to Vienna, and first I met with General Mark Clark who was the American general in command of Austria. I paid my courtesy call. He wanted to make certain that I had not come at the express orders of Eisenhower because Eisenhower was not in command of Germany. I told him I had simply come to see how well the American Army under his command was taking care of Jewish survivors in the Austrian camps.</p><p>When I came to Vienna and I visited the Rothchild Hospital, which was kind of a way-station for the Brichah, where they housed Jewish</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

I met members of the Brichah there who said they have a very important matter in which they asked my help. They explained that a border crossing from Yugoslavia into the Russian ....in Austria.</p><p>END OF TAPE ... who had come there from Poland. They wanted to know if that Russian crossing point was closed permanently or whether it would be opened again, the reason being that they had made all kinds of preparations before they used that crossing point. Money had been passed from hand to hand to make sure that it would be safe to bring Jewish refugees across that border crossing point. Now it was closed. Would they have to open another border crossing point with the required payment of sufficient funds, with making certain that it was militarily safe? I said how could I help. They said that by coincidence, a sheer coincidence, there was a Russian officer who was an aid to the Russian commanding general in Vienna. This Russian officer's name was the same as my last name, Nadich. This Russian Jew had come from the Ukraine, that they planned having a party in the apartment of one of the members of Brichah in honor of the two Nadichs, the one who was on the staff of the Russian commanding general, and the one who was the advisor to the American commanding general, that they would supply us both with plenty of vodka, that I should ply my colleague with drinks until I would get the answer, if he knew the answer. So the party took place. I was pleased to meet my colleague with the same name. We spoke about the Jewish conditions in the Ukraine. He told me of his great concern, his great fear about his return after the war to the Ukraine. The Nazis had been there for several years and had poisoned the minds of those who had not been antisemitic before. He didn't know what would befall the surviving Russian Jews if they were to return to the Ukraine. Gradually we got around to the subject in which I was interested. I discussed with him the crossing point from Yugoslavia into the Russian zone of Austria. By this time I neglected to mention before we began to talk privately, the other members of the Brichah had had left the room, and the two of us were left alone. And I tried to keep up with him glass for glass with the vodka and then he gave me, he actually knew the answer and he gave it to me. No, he said. That crossing is closed temporarily, only for a few days. Next week it will be opened again. As soon as I got what I wanted, I continued filling his glass but I stopped drinking, and soon the members of the Brichah came into the room, and the party was over and then I conveyed to them the information they wanted.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. That was an interesting experience that I had and I must say it was very, very difficult for me. Difficult because I wasn't certain that I could successfully keep up with the Russian Nadich in the drinking the vodka. And I wanted to make sure that my mind would remain clear until I got the information I was charged to get. But it worked. It worked.</p></p></dialogue>

The party was over...</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The party was over. I visited several camps in Austria, wrote reports about them also for General Eisenhower and for General Clark. General Clark had told me that he and General Eisenhower were taking a brief, well-earned vacation in the south of France in early August, when the cables began flying from Washington about the report of Dean Earl Harrison that condemned the American Army for not adequately taking care of Jewish survivors in the American zone of Germany, and Eisenhower returned at once to Frankfurt and Mark Clark returned to Vienna. Interestingly I met, in 1971, General Mark Clark's son. I was on my way to Japan and Viet Nam to hold torah convocations for the American Army chaplains serving in the Pacific and in Viet Nam and I called upon the commanding general of the American Army in the Pacific at his headquarters in Honolulu and he was the son of General Mark Clark. And he asked me about my meetings with his father in Vienna in 1945. I visited with my friend, my very close friend whom I really loved, uh Chaplain Elia Bonen (ph) with the 42nd Division, now at headquarters in Salzburg. I visited DP camps in various parts of Germany, including the large one at Linz. And then...(Tell me...) Then I returned to what was my proper base of operations, the American zone of, of Germany, Austria...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What condition did you find the survivors in these camps?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: That's a very important question. What condition did I find the survivors in in the various camps in Germany and Austria? I speak particularly of the camps in Germany because I visited them not once but a number of times. The housing was not adequate. The amount of food they were getting was not sufficient. They needed much better clothing, especially warmer clothing and decent shoes for the oncoming winter. They required all kinds of assistance so that they could work again. In the various camps, and I think particularly, I remember particularly Landsberg, work shops were set up under the supervision of some of the Jewish displaced persons themselves. For example in Landsberg, Jacob O'Likesky (ph) who had been the head of the program of the art in Lithuania and therefore had the experience in setting up workshops and supervising them. O'Likesky headed setting up workshops in the DP camp at Landsberg, but he needed tools. He need implements. He needed machinery, and I asked for the requisitioning of that from German sources. In addition there were German, there were Jewish musicians in the DP camps. They wanted to play their instruments again, but they had no instruments. They wanted to give concerts again in the DP camps, and so I asked that violins and uh wind instruments and string instruments and percussion instruments be requisitioned from German sources of supply, and they were. They needed athletic equipment, sports supplies. They wanted to play what they called football, but we play soccer. I don't mean all of them did, but there were sufficient numbers of younger men, and we requisitioned these supplies for them.</p><p>And there was hardly an aspect of living conditions where they didn't need supplies of all kinds.</p><p>Gradually, as the weeks went by, the situation in the camps improved, bit by bit, week after week. They continued their improvement during the three months that I was at work in Germany and they continued their improvement even afterwards under the civilian advisors to General Eisenhower.</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

They were strong both physically and psychically. And that was because of their strength and their will and their determination that they were able to survive.</p><p>We talked until two o'clock in the morning, until we both fell asleep. In the morning I took him, after the train landed, after the train arrived in, in uh Frankfurt, I took him first to uh be registered, to be signed in, to the American Army mess. We had breakfast. Then I took him to General Eisenhower's suite of offices. General Eisenhower was not there at the time. He was on a field trip. But I introduced him to General Walter Beetle Smith, saying General Smith, if there were a Jewish state now, I would be introducing the prime minister of that state. That was uh no great feat on my part. Of course Ben Gurion was the leading Jew of the Jewish community and it was a foregone conclusion that if there were to be a Jewish state, he would be at its head. I was later told by General Smith that when he introduced him to General Eisenhower, that General Eisenhower was greatly impressed by this man, Ben Gurion, and that he reported to General Smith that he was very much taken by him. He asked Ben Gurion to visit the camps and of course Ben Gurion had come for that purpose, and to report to General Eisenhower upon his findings after his tour would be over. Well after I had introduced him to General Walter Beetle Smith, and we had had lunch, I took uh David Ben Gurion to his first DP camp, to Zilesheim (ph), which was not far from Frankfurt, near the German town ofH___. In Zilesheim--I would come often because it was close to Frankfurt--the people there were accustomed to my coming in with an American Army vehicle, and a number of them saw me come in this time too. A few of them came over to say hello. They happened to peer inside my car in the back seat and they saw something that was incredible to them. They knew the picture of Ben Gurion, but they couldn't by the wildest stretch of their imagination imagine that he would be there in their camp in Germany. They began to scream "Ben Gurion, Ben Gurion. As others heard the shouts, they came running, and I was afraid of a riot and I cried out, my friends, please show Ben Gurion the discipline of which you are capable. You go around and tell all the people in the camp that David Ben Gurion is here and that he will speak to them. Let them come to the assembly hall. They ran. They gathered up the people who were there. They came to the assembly hall and when Ben Gurion and I reached the assembly hall, we went to the back of the stage. The assembly hall was quickly filled. The windows and doors were flung open so that people who couldn't get in, who couldn't fi...get even into the standing room which was completely full, could at least hear standing outside the windows and the doors. And I came out to introduce Eisenhower. As the two of us came on the stage, the large throng of people rose and the people began to sing the Hatikvah (ph) and as they sang the Hatikvah, many of them burst into weeping. And I must confess that Eisenhower...that David Ben Gurion and I also wept for the Jews in that assembly hall. At that moment, that DP camp, their liberation was complete.</p><p>They had dreamed most of them of some day getting to Palestine. Here, in the form of Ben Gurion, Palestine had come to them.

And the remaining 25% wanted to go either to the United States or Canada or to South America or to Australia and he he also wanted to know the answer to an important question that he put to them. I knew it was a test question. He said to them, if we of the Jewish agency were to issue an order that on a certain day all the Jews in the DP camps of Germany should march out of those camps, march across borders to ports in southern Italy, would you follow such a command, knowing that you would be ordered by the American military to return to your camps, that you would be shot at by perhaps by Italian border police, that it might cost you your lives? Would you follow such an order? And to a man they answered, give the order. We will follow it. Ben Gurion told me afterwards he was extremely pleased by the metal of the survivors. His first meeting with survivors, and he saw what they were like. Unhappily, I could not accompany him on the rest of his tour of DP camps because I had been informed that same day that the civilian advisor invited by General Eisenhower when he issued the order appointing me as his military advisor on Jewish affairs, the civilian advisor appointed by President Truman was soon to arrive in Frankfurt from the United States. He was Judge Simon H. Rifkin (ph), then of the Federal bench.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What did you do then? Where...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well uh, Ben Gurion went on his way to cover the major DP camps. I went to the railroad station to meet Judge Rifkin who was arriving on the military train from Paris, and later I learned that when Ben Gurion came back, and I saw him again when he came back to Army headquarters in Frankfurt before he departed, he gave General Eisenhower, as the general had requested, a report on his findings. He requested certain things that the Jewish DPs had asked of me which I knew could not happen. For example, he asked that the Jews be taken out of the DP camps, that whole German villages should be requisitioned for them, that the German occupants of the housing in those villages be evicted, and that the, the Jewish displaced persons be brought to take the houses of the Germans evicted from their homes in these villages. I knew that would be turned down by Eisenhower, and I myself never made that recommendation. Ben Gurion did.</p><p>And Eisenhower turned it down. But another request by Eisenhower was honored by Eisen...another request by Ben Gurion to Eisenhower was honored by the general. He asked that teams of Jews from the then called Palestine be permitted to enter the DP camps to serve on the staffs of those administering the camps, people, JDC people, to be of help to the Jews in <span class="page-break" number="20"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 2 TECHNICAL CONVERSATION</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: OK. Uh can you at this point tell me something about General Eisenhower and your relationship with him? What was he like?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I'm glad you asked that question. Uh General Eisenhower, I learned years later when he received an honorary degree at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, spoke of the fact that he and his brothers were raised by their mother on the stories of what he called the Old Testament, and he grew up believing that the Jews were indeed the chosen people. And that they were the first to bring to humanity the divine message of ethics and morality. I got to know him through the humanitarian approach that he took to the improvement of the Jewish survivors in the DP camps in Germany. At the very beginning he cut through what was a gordion (ph) knot with which generals at American Army headquarters were wrestling for a long time. The gordion knot consisted of the old question, who are the Jews. A question that has been given much attention by scholars of all kinds. Are the Jews a nation? Are they a religious grouping?</p><p>Are they arace? Are they a people? On the one hand it was argued that the Jews could not be given special attention in the DP camps because you couldn't look upon them as Jews. There were either German nationals or Austrian nationals or Polish nationals or Czech nationals. And if you were to look upon them as Jews and deprive them of their nationality, were you not doing the same thing that the Nazis had done, of robbing them of their citizenship, and looking upon them as a racial group. On the other hand, how could you help them if you did not look upon them as a special separate group. Well, Eisenhower cut through that gordion knot and when he received these several communications from Washington, from General Marshall, from Secretary Stimpson, and I must stress from President Truman, that the situation must be corrected, Eisenhower at once made up his mind he was going to stop with all of this argument, all of this debate, and he was going to treat the Jews as a separate group. And German Jews and Austrian Jews and Italian Jews were no longer to be enemy nationals, but victims, and to be treated as victims of the Nazis and the Jews who didn't want to go back to their homelands, they were to be treated as a special group, given special help, brought back to the level of ordinary common place health of human beings and because he did that, I credit him with the speedy rehabilitation of the Jewish survivors. He came to speak at the Park Avenue Synagogue at my invitation in May of 1965. By that time he had been President of the United States, and he was living in Gettysburg. I telephoned him and I asked him would he come to speak at a special service at my synagogue commemorating the 20th anniversary of the liberation of the German concentration camps by the American Army under his command. He agreed to come. In introducing him to my congregation, I said to them, I want to tell you one story about this man which will be sufficient to tell you about his character, his humanitarianism, and his answer to the difficult Jewish problem. I said when we, when the German arm...when the American Army liberated the concentration camps in Germany, there were definitions of who was a displaced person. Who was a displaced person who would benefit from housing, food, clothing and all the rest under the aegis of the American Army. The displaced person was defined as a survivor, in this case particularly a Jewish survivor, liberated in a concentration camp on German soil. But soon there came into the American zone of Germany, other Jews.</p><p>Jews who had been in hiding in Poland. Jews who had been shoved back by the Russians behind the front lines, all the way back to Siberia, an action that actually saved their lives. Now these</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

They found that their homes and their businesses could not be reclaimed. They discovered that their loved ones had been murdered by the Nazis and the Polish or Ukrainian or Lithuanian helpers and they no longer wanted to try to make out, to make a new life where they had originally lived. And spontaneously they started a trek from Poland to the American zone of Germany, later organized and assisted by the men and women of the Brichah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did Eisenhower react to this?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Ah, this is a major point that I wanted to make. When these Jews started coming across the borders to enter the American zone of Germany, Eisenhower was asked by the commanders on lower levels, what shall we do with these refugees who are coming into our zone in such large numbers. I was asked for a recommendation. The recommendation of course was that they be admitted into the DP camps in the American zone of Germany. General Eisenhower approved that recommendation. Eighty thousand Jews came in, and Eisenhower, by that one order of approval, contributed to the saving of eighty thousand Jewish lives. Now my friendship with him continued after the war. I was asked to help write items of interest in his campaign for the presidency, such as his Rosh Hashanah message during the campaign. My wife and I were invited to the Inauguration. Before that time I was invited to give an invocation at the Republican National Convention that had that had nominated him. I had him at my synagogue, but before that I had visited him at Gettysburg at his farm, so we remained in close contact all through the years.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did Eisenhower, did you and Eisenhower at the time you made this recommendation, did you talk to him face to face? What did he say to you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I did not in most instances have the opportunity of speaking to him face to face. I did often. I did have the privilege of coming to his office, speaking to him face to face, most of the times answering his questions. When he was not in his office, and that was, that occurred frequently, he would be out on a field trip, then my conversations were with the second in command, his chief of staff General Walter Beetle Smith.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did Eisenhower ever talk to you about the Jews and his feelings about Jews?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I did have occasion to hear such remarks from Eisenhower. He always spoke in an affirmative fashion. He always condemned every kind of bigotry and prejudice. He hated what the Nazis had done. He issued orders, after he had first visited Dachau, that American military commanders should bring their units to see Dachau so that the troops might know what they had been fighting against. He visited Feldafing on Yom Kippur, spoke to the Jews assembled there, told them of his high admiration for them, for the Jewish people and for Judaism, and urged them to keep their hope high, that they still had a future. Eisenhower was that kind of personality.</p></p></dialogue>

I returned to the United States on a troop transport and uh I came back to the United States at the end of November, beginning of December in 1945.</p><p>Before my return I had been visited at my headquarters in uh Frankfurt by uh Major Edward Warburg (ph) who was at that time the president of the Joint Distribution Committee, and he was good enough to invite me. After I would be discharged from the Army, to become a member of the staff of the JDC. He even suggested that I would be appointed Director of JDC operations in Germany, after I would spend at least a month or so with my family back home. But I returned to the United States. Soon afterwards I was asked to speak at the annual meeting of the Joint Distribution Committee in New York. I was full of vehement indignation at what I had seen. I had, I contrasted that with what I had found among American Jews when I returned. There was very little awareness among American Jews of what had happened to their fellow Jews in Europe. Very few were aware of it, and very few were concerned about it, naturally, because they didn't know. So I was angry and at my uh, I was asked to speak at the annual meeting of the JDC and I'm afraid that I gave voice to my anger at that meeting, but to my surprise I was asked to give an address the following week at the annual meeting of the United Jewish Appeal to take place in Atlantic City where an unheard of goal was to be proclaimed, a goal of $100,000,000 to be raised during 1946 among the Jews of the United States. Of course I uh accepted the invitation. I addressed the UJA Conference in Atlantic City the following week, and I was asked the next morning to have breakfast with the leaders of the JDC and the UJA who were there at that conference, and at the breakfast table I was told that I was being relieved of the employment I was to have with the JDC. Instead I was asked to accept employment with the United Jewish Appeal and to be a speaker for the hundred million dollar campaign from which of course the JDC would be receiving its funds. And I agreed and for the next six months I spoke in forty different states of the country. I had no place I could call my home. I just went from town to town, city to city, and spoke at UJA fund raising meetings. According to the calculations that I kept myself, some $20,000,000 were raised at those meetings. The JDC then asked me to return to Europe, to visit the DP camps in Germany, Austria, Italy, once again to bring myself up to date on what had happened and then to go to South Africa where I was to spend four months in South Africa, what were then called Southern and Northern Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe and Zambia, and to raise funds there for the South African Jewish War Appeal, the agency that then transmitted its funds to the Joint Distribution Committee for work among the Jewish survivors in Europe. I spent a brief while in America. I met the young lady at that time to whom I became engaged after three weeks. Sadly I departed on my mission for the JDC to Europe, from there to South Africa where I met the most generous Jews I had as yet met in my career. South African Jews gave generously, very generously, and I made friends among them, friends to this day, and similarly with the Jews, the few Jews in Zimbabwe and Zambia. I went as far north as what was then called Livingston, in northern Rhodesia and now Zambia, and of course as far south as Capetown. And I spoke in every city, town and dork (ph) in which there were seventy Jews or more. And happily the South African Jewish War Appeal reported that the campaign was very successful. I returned to the United States. I got married, happily, and then I worked for the United Jewish Appeal in the New York City campaign for six months. Then tired of not having had a home for myself for a good number of years, my wife and I settled down in the town of Brookline, Massachusetts, where I</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.
