<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I, however, never lived in Vienna.

And I mention this place whose German name is and Czech name is because there <span class="page-break" number="0"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Before you go into that, tell us a little bit more about what you were doing, how you came to go to France to study?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was...I have German schools, and I was studying in Prague from "36 to "38...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What were you studying?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: At the German university, I was first studying medicine, which I gave up, and then I studied uh uh philosophy and uh romance language and that's why I went to France.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see. And when you came to France, where did you go to school?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I was first in Tulle (ph). Tulle is a city west of Paris and then when Czechoslovakia...when and Czechoslovakia had to cede its territory, the so- <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> Uh one of them is the famous uh published Maxwell who bought one of the New York...that's the New York Post...one of the New York papers.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you serve with these people?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, and I served with these people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And what what what was that like? What kind of housing...what kind of...?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was very...we were very badly treated, all of us. Incidentally, there was anti-Semitism in the army. There was no anti-Semitism in the all-Czechoslovakia, in Bohemia and Moravia but there was anti-Semitism, even anti-Semitic remarks made by officers. The army was very badly treated by the French. It was ill-equipped. It was...the food was bad.</p><p>We lived in barracks where the wind was blowing through and there happened to be...we were in the south of France where generally the the climate is mild, but it was a very cold winter, the winter of 1939-1940. And we believed we are kind of parade army and we will be used when Germany is defeated, we will be used as the as the core of the Czech army, which will move back to Prague, but when France suffered one defeat after the other, in May 1940 we were well-equipped, or relatively well-equipped and we were sent to the front and we were...we were positioned uh east of Paris as part of the army to defend Paris and the front was broken and we retreated. We were again...I...my...there there were only small units left. This unit in with which I was was again used at the River and that was the end of the of the campaign of France. France was defeated and uh I like other people tried to get away from France. Now some people went to where the army in southern France...where the army had originally been stationed. I tried to get to western France and to get from western France on a ship to to England or to the west, but I couldn't get on any ship and finally...finally I ended up at the at the Spanish frontier together with some other boys and we thought we would go into Spain so we were afraid of this because we guessed that uh in Franco Spain we would be arrested and while we were approaching the frontier, we learned from the radio that Germany will not occupy the whole of France but only a stretch of territory uh inland from the Atlantic, so when you were beyond this demarkation line, you would be in unoccupied France, so we didn't go to it. We went to Spain and then to to this unoccupied part of France and there I was together with French refugees, my comrades...they're not close friends but whom I had just met...and they went to a little village in southern France. There again I became...or not again, but first 1 became a teacher in a very interesting family. The family was in part very pro-German, very pro-German and the elder part...the elder parts of the family were happy that France had been defeated and that was so because one of the ladies...it was a tremendous family...one of the ladies was the daughter of the French Prime Minister who in 19...in 1866...who in 1870 uh had declared war on Germany and on Napoleon the Third and had said we enter this war with a light..-with a light-heart, light-heartedly,</p><p> . And uh six weeks later they were beaten in , so this lady found a <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> The young people were...were anti-German. They were very nice and I stayed with them and I taught a little boy and a young girl until one day my wife, my present wife, came and found me there and we traveled together toto__, a little place, near near the city of Lemouge (ph) where her father and her mother had been and they found themselves after dramatic circumstances because millions of French people had left, had fled the Germans at this time, and uh I stayed with them but they had nothing to eat and I decided there...and they shared everything but I decided I can't stay with them, so I went on my way to Grenoble (ph). Why Grenoble? I don't know. It was in the unoccupied zone and there I was demobilized by the French and there I got a carde identite (ph) as a student.</p><p>Now very few foreigners had a carde identite, a permission of staying in France. I had one but it...from this I couldn't live and after many attempts to...after many attempts to to find some way of uh ma...making a living which I couldn't do, I I found a job as I told you before in western France, again as a teacher in a family, in an aristocratic refuge family and I I decided to go there and but you you could only travel at this time with a special permit, de voyage (ph) it was called so I went to the police and asked for a de voyage and they told me why why you want to go there and I said my aunt is <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> anti-Jewish laws, generally when we had to deal with the police and even in the camp, we were not singled out as being Jews. There was no anti-Semitism except in there...I mean no open anti-Semitism except in in Government levels but we didn't hear any any anti- Jewish remarks and uh anti-Semitism came in to force for us only when we were deported, or when people were arrested as Jews, but that was much later. Of course, many French people might have lost their jobs or their business, but I speak now from my own personal experience. There was no anti-Semitic movement or attitude. We were dirty foreigners. The French have an expression... . Dirty foreigner, and we belonged to the dirty foreigner who potentially took away...took away French jobs, but this reminds me that during my flight uh to the south when the army was dispersed and I tried to go get on a ship, I was once by chance...in the very last days of the French campaign in a compartment, a railroad compartment. There were three British students and a lady, and the lady turned out to be the wife of the French Ambassador to Franco,</p><p> . She was Madame , and the Monsieur was the successor to , and she came into the compartment. She was very friendly and she said since . She says these are the German Jews who have done us this, and this <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> hundred fifty grams of bread. At noon...at...in the forenoon, in the morning, which was the basis of all our food. At noon we got a water soup with carrots or with uh onions and in the evening we got, believe it or not, one artichoke and some of for drink...long period...one artichoke or a little bit of artificial honey, sometimes a glass of uh of wine.</p><p>Now wine has calories. The net effect of this was that uh if people didn't get help from outside, parcels or some help in some other way, they died after about one year, and many people died there. The regime was very strict and from time to time they shot somebody, always saying that the person wanted to escape and that was probably partly true but partly was other...their method of intimidating people. As I said, there were foreigners from all over Europe and the Gestapo came from time to time together with German officials and asked people whether they want to work voluntarily in Germany and many people see that they can't survive, Poles in particular, Hungarians uh volunteered for work in Germany. I have read...I don't know anymore where, but I believe it's true...that there were other Jews from eastern Europe, from Hungary, who said they wantto__-- in Germany. Didn't say they were Jews. They were Hungarians, and they survived in this way as foreign workers in Germany. Uh I stayed there for two years and the hygienic conditions were horrible. We were filthy. We were dirty. We had nothing to eat. We had lice. We had fleas. Many people died, of course, from diseases, but...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you work? Was there work?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No. We didn't have to work. We didn't have to work. We had to do some what they called</p><p> , some work in...for the camp, you know, but otherwise we didn't have to work and being told all the time. I was...after...I don't know...after I was there for a while I was called and said...by the...by a captain whose name incidentally was Vernet, Captain Vernet, and Captain Vernet said you are here by mistake. Uh yes, we recognize you have been in the army and so we will send you to a better camp, and that happened...I was in say a month and at the beginning it raised my my hope and my morale and I didn't believe inin___ anymore, but I got indeed some privilege because of their alleged mistake. I was made deputy postmaster, . That is to say I was allowed to <span class="page-break" number="5"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Uh | for instance, was reading a tremendous lot and many people were were reading a tremendous lot. Other people there were...I don't reca...there were small Jewish religious groups but I must repeat that wasn't a Jewish camp so it was a camp for foreigner, so many of the foreigners were Jewish, but except for knowing that there were Jewish, there was no identification of being Jewish and there were other religious groups, Jewish religious people which...whom I haven't seen in Auschwitz...I haven't seen any...a few I have to ...uh what did they do? They were desperate. Uh they played chess <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> There was a railroad station of Vernet, and you could see it. It was uh perhaps a mile away but you could see it, and we saw on the Sth or the 6th of uh August that there are railroad cars there which generally were not there and probably on the 6th, a great number of people were surrounded in the camp, because in the camp we were...and you believed you are...you were free in the camp. You can...within limits, you were free. We were surrounded and __ say they would be deported. Now all of them were Jews. There were many non-Jews in the camp, but I do believe we didn't realize that all of them were Jews because as I said before, there was...we didn't feel being Jews in this sense that we were singled out, and they were deported and they were marched to the station and were deported. At the end of August of 1942, something uh incredible happened. Whole families came into the camp and these were all Jews, people, Jewish people who had taken refuge in France and who had managed to live outside camps, who had some even jobs. How they managed, I don't know...if some lived from their savings and had some savings...but they were people living outside and they were all brought into the camp, and that was far sensational. Not only...we had...there were no women in the camp, so there were not only men and women came in...whole families and children. We hadn't seen children for two years, and uh they were not badly treated. Uh they had enough to eat and they were, of course, deeply depressed and I guess they knew already but we might have heard too, that there were de...deportations of Jews to Germany because I think some people listened...could listen or to the to the British broadcast. They had heard about it, so this was an all Jewish affair. That was very clear, and it was a deportation affair and the first transport was also deportation, but it wasn't very clear...didn't seem so much as a punishment. It could be interpreted as a...and since it was only men, it could be interpreted as meaning they are going to work. The Germans uh uh always hired people who were imprisoned or wanted those people in Germany so that they took Jews to Germany was a bit strange but we didn't think about this as far as I remember. It's now fifty years, but as far as I remember about the second time, this was ominous. This was dangerous, and we couldn't understand what it means. And there was in the camp a group of perhaps fifteen, twenty people like I who had been in the French army, and we were suddenly separated from the others and we believed that we are separated because France would never send the people who had...who have fought for France, would never surrender those people to the enemy. On the contrary I mean what they did was to be sure that we don't run away, they...it wasn't impossible to run away. In spite of all the guards and for men like...who like me who had a right to be around in the camp because I was postmaster, it would have been considerably possible, like in Auschwitz later. I'll tell you about it. It was possible, possible to run away. But what happened afterwards is the second question because where would you ever run. You had no papers. You had no mon...money. Uh people there are certainly hostile. If you were to knock at their door, who would have helped you. But so they wanted to be sure that we don't run away, but we cer...we misinterpreted this. As a matter of fact there was in the camp a French police officer who was and I was quite on good terms with him because he spoke <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> friendly way, and he had likewise because it was profound dishonor. The French <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> 0 freight car, and we considered breaking out but again the question was, you know, we could have lifted the boards. There was nothing in the freight car but the boards. Uh perhaps you could have lifted them and jumped out and we were...also it was strange the French uh gendarmes, not not the Germans but uh then the question arose . Where are we going? We will be caught again. So after perhaps twenty-four hours, we came to Drancy and that's in...and then then _-- Drancy. Drancy looked horrible. Drancy consisted of barracks or which had been made for the French police before the war and which could not be occupied because they were wet and badly built, so they stood empty, I guess. I know...I think they stood empty before we came. Not only before we came...before Drancy became a concentration camp. Uh we left incidentally on the Ist...on the 1st of September...the 1st of September of Vernet. We were perhaps on the 2nd or the 3rd in Drancy, which is in a suburb of Paris. It was fully of concentra...of uh of of uh barbed wire. Of course, we couldn't see the whole thing. We know there were other sections, except the section where we were. We were put into rooms which were full of uh rotten straw. It was rotting, you know. It's wet and rotting, and there we were waiting, and, of course, uh uh being very much concerned and preoccupied what's going to happen. It was a morbid situation already you know. Under the rotten straw and with children and uh old people and the complete uh uh the complete helplessness and the complete lack of uh of...we didn't know what's going to happen...to happen to us but we knew, of course, we are now in the clutches of the German and at night we heard sometimes shooting from other parts of the camp. We didn't know what it means. I remember I | went to one of the barbed wires and saw...and tried to see whether I can get...I can get out but it was out of questioning, and then after three or four days there, uh we were ordered to go down...down...we we were upstairs I remember. We had to go downstairs, you know, to the...to the platform and on the platform there was already the SS and with...with their customary politeness, shouting and beating and and uh sending us into the...into the railroad cars. Now, the French railroads had on every...perhaps they have it to day...I don't think they have it today, but in the 2nd World War, an inscription saying forthe _. That was from the 1st World War and they still have it in the 2nd World War. For the . [know we were, but I I know this from having read it <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> 1 knew this. But we were never told, and I have always said, no Nazi ever now told why I was in Auschwitz. I was never told why I was persecuted by the Nazis. I would say...no, they didn't...but they treated us like Jews. I mean they treated us like uh like non-human beings. They beat us and they shouted and uh the worst thing which happened was when I stayed with the French freight cars were for forty...forty men or eight horses. I guess they put in about eighty people. I cannot say how many, but I do know when we were...when we came in, we came into the in the freight, into the freight train, on on the on the side opposite the door were little...they're little openings and they were with barbed wire. You could look out there but not very well. It was pretty dark there, and it...we were so crowded that when you sat down, you couldn't stretch your leg. You...you couldn't move. You you were...you were fixed in this position. There were women, children, old people. They gave us...they gave us and I think they gave us enough <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> 2</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Bracelet...and it had a number...7 - 7 - 7, and here I have the number 1 -7-7-7-7-4, SO...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh Linda would like you to repeat the phrase about the bracelet so my voice isn't in there, so the only identity...just say it again.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The only identity...iden...not id...identity, document or identity piece which I had on myself was a military bracelet which...from my military service in France which had a number 7 - 7 - 7. And it...and I I threw away at this point. That's really the point I want to make. I threw it away somehow because I thought it would indicate that I have been in the French army, which was right, but the strange coincidence is that there were three 7's, and here I have four 7's on my...here. (Cough) So after a couple of hours, pandemonium broke out. People were crying. People were uh shouting, wailing. It was...there was the terrible stench and people always...the train stopped quite often. I remember it stopped once I believe in Mintz (ph). Mintz, in in the Alsace (ph). I I figured it's Mintz, in the Alsace. And people shouted to to the outside, open the door. We want to so that we throw the the the excrements out and we want water, but the doors were not opened. Then we came...there was a little incident. We came into a big railroad station and I believe it was Frankfurt or__. It was in a big city, and opposite our tra...in the train...our train stopped and opposite our train was a first class train of Germans and they stared at us, and and a lady who was...a woman who was on the train took her little girl and and held it up to the little window with barbed wire, and shouted, water, please, water, please, water. And the Germans...there were...there were fifty in this railroad...in this other train, looked at us and they didn't move because they were afraid and I mean there was no satisfaction on their...they could have shouted dirty Jews, which happened later on, but nothing , and suddenly a German woman was running on the platform with a <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> 3 they are trying to kill us there, so suddenly after three, or four or five days...I don't know...the train stopped in an open field and we heard shout...shouting...shoutings...everybody...all men between I guess they said fifty and...fifteen and fifty...1 don't know...something like this. Perhaps...yeah, probably...fifteen and fifty...all men between fifteen and fifty, out. Women and children remain inside. Well, we jumped out of the...out of the...out of the wagon and there was...there was a little hill and we walked...we we run down the hill, and the SS came and and uh and uh uh pushed all the people back, but you see there were some younger people, young men who didn't want to separate from their families. They didn't want to come down, so they tried to get them down and the same woman who had shown her child in the train on the German station, walked out and an SS man came...with the child...and an SS man came and threw the child against the wagon and probably killed the child and shoved the mother back and she carried the child. It was bleeding. She had the child back. And we walked down a little slope and suddenly let me go back to the train. I really do not recall and cannot really imagine now how...what happened with this one bucket and with this...with this bucket of water. You know, the bucket of water was, of course, empty, but the toilet bucket, I know it was overflowing. There was stench. I must say I personally wouldn't recall that I used it. I don't recall. I don't recall, and there was stench. There was dirt. There was...you know, the the excrements were all over.</p><p>Also, when you're in a lot of stench, you become insensitive to it. You don't...I don't think you you you don't feel it anymore. Uh it was hot. It was depressing. Also physiologically de...depressing. Uh you were not very active, not very alert, but I must say...that's a very good question...I do not really know what people did after the bucket...and I myself...after all, as I say, I think it was between three or five days...I myself don't recall, and after all, after three or five days you have some need to go somewhere. I don't recall.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Would you tell us again now about the train stopping? Where it stopped?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. The train stopped near a little town called Kozel (ph), which is in Upper Salasia and which is I believe at the River. at this time. It stopped in the open <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> 4 construction work, on the high....highway. It was very important that I speak about this because people think of gas and beating and sickness and starvation, but <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> 5 Kubacheck (ph), and when the train moved west and we moved to , he was standing next to me and suddenly started to talk to me. He said to me, I am not Jewish. I am a Polish officer, and I cannot say that I am a Polish officer because...you see, he had some confidence in me because I had given him...I had preserved his nice stamps, and if he dared to say that he is a Polish officer, they would take him out and kill him. And he later on...I'll tell you later on...he helped me. He really saved my life twice, so it was Stanislov Kubacheck and then we...the train went west and we came to a camp called Lauerhutte (ph). Now Lauerhutte...you know what a hutte is...a hutte in German is a combination between a mine and a blast furnace. In Upper Salasia it was full of heavy industry and Lauerhutte was one of those huttes where you had blasted furnaces and where you had...I don't know whether there was a coal mine or not. Lauerhutte which is the German name is...was part of a big city called...a relatively big industrial city called in German Hindenburg (ph) after Hindenburg, and I know it was called in Polish</p><p> , and it's a combination of many industrial smaller towns in <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> 6 came there sometimes in the middle of September. We left uh Paris, Drancy, the first of September and we came there around the middle of September. By the beginning of November, about one third, all the Dutch were gone. All the Dutch who had...didn't survive Kozel, had died. And the people who died and every day people died, the people who died...we were in this big room where there had been boilers before, a boiler room...</p><p>and there were...there were bunker beds...beds, you know, uh three story beds, and behind us there was some straw and the Dutch people were always around into the straw.</p><p>The next day they were carried out in one coffin...one coffin, and there was a a team (ph) which didn't do anything else but the whole day they they they carried the dead people out and uh and as I said, by November I guess one third of the people had died, and new people came in. Uh at this time, before this happened, I was once ordered to go by truck to the station...now I don't know whether whether Lauerhutte had a station or whether it was , to a station and I was sitting with another buddy, with another inmate, <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> 7 could ask for sick leave...sick leave...you could ask not to go to work for one day but it was very dangerous because when you came to the sick bay and then you went... . Lwas so weak I stayed in bed andI didn't want to go. I was what happened. I couldn't anymore and this Stanislov Kubacheck, this Polish officer who had become a kapo, helped me. In the first place, the kapo has...had to...had to watch whether his people got one ration...got their food, and he had to watch others that they don't don't come twice and take food twice, so he allowed me to go twice.</p><p>I was the first and came the last one. Then he took me to his commander in his team and I didn't have to work, so I recovered and I must say amongst the many circumstances why I survived, that was one, but it's only one because there were thousands other dangers which I was exposed to and that's then another story. Uh I must say from Lauerhutte we also were sent to work in combination. I don't remember <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> 8 what and it was very difficult to help people back. And from time to time there were selections, particularly these prisoners were sent out because they couldn't work but we didn't quite understand why that was. Uh but we did understand because I want to say now at the end of our stay in in Lauerhutte, we had a very good Polish master. We worked in a factory under German masters or Polish masters and we were watched and guarded by by these uh SR or whatever they were, and it was known that we would uh be transferred and he thought we would be sent to the gas and so he was very kind and sad.</p><p>He gave us cigarettes and then one day we were...we were transferred in August of 1943 and we went to Blechhammer (ph). Now Lauerhutte was a small camp and it was an outside camp of Auschwitz. Blechhammer was a big camp. There were five thousand people in Blechhammer and it was Auschwitz No. III. I have as I said before I have read a lot about concentration camps and the Holocaust, and I think there is no clarity about the number of camps, about the number...the the the number assigned to certain camps.</p><p>There was Auschwitz I which was...which was the Auschwitz work camp which was a horrible camp. Then Auschwitz II was Birkenau. That was the extermination camp, so not everybody that was in Birkenau was exterminated. There were people who were for weeks in Birkenau and instead of going to the gas, they were sent to work, and then there were...was Auschwitz III, and to my knowledge that was the camp of Blechhammer, uh Buna (ph)...there's another camp...there were further camps having...having the...having the...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Linda's saying don't worry about the details but to go on with your own story.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah. And in Blechhammer, after a short period where we were guarded by the German army and the German shouldn't say the army didn't do anything. We were guarded by the German regular German army. Then we were guarded by the SS. Uh there is a very good book by who wrote.... <span class="page-break" number="11"></span> 9 where I had it...a spoon, but there were people who had nothing of this, so they would get their food in a big washing...wash dish for let's say six people, and now imagine how can you get your food...how can you fish out part of the soup and the potatoes...there were potatoes in it...if you have no instrument, you know, utensil to take it out. These people quarreled, didn't get what was their due, and uh many of them died of course. Uh we worked...we were in the camp and we got up in the summer at five o'clock...no, in the summer at four or three o'clock. In the winter later and we worked from six in the morning to six in the evening, twelve hours. We worked on various jobs and the type of job you had depended...determined very much your your your fate because if you had a heavy job, it was exhausting and you were exposed to beatings. If you had a relatively light job, you were exempt from this. You were not exposed to this and I must say in Blechhammer I worked on construction work, but I was able to make it and then then I had light...light work, and the last job I had in Blechhammer was...there were...there there were...and there were...all the windows were broken from bombings and so we had to fit in uh cardboards where the the glass had been. I must tell you that Blechhammer was one of the German factories where oil, petrol, gasoline was derived from coal. It was one of the most important German factories and there were a few of such factories in Bohemia, in central Germany, and there, and at the end when the Germans lost uh Romanian oil fields, they were of of utmost strategic importance and I'll tell you later on about the bombing. Uh how should I systematize Blechhammer. I've told you about uh there being various nationalities, and uh we had to walk about two, three miles...no, two, three kilometers to the factory. We had to get up very, very early. Uh the factory employed twenty-five thousand people. Among them were five thousand Germans who were free workers, a small number of French and Czech workers who were free workers who were only obliged to work there, and a great number of slaves of uh various degrees, prisoners of war, English prisoners of war, French prisoners of war, Yugoslav prisoners of war and so on. Uh so in the morning, you could...it was an incredible picture. You could see...it was still dark...you could see from all sides the people marching towards the factory and uh we were surrounded on both sides by the SS which had like long whips with <span class="page-break" number="11"></span> 0 end...at the point which I am now talking about...there were some thirty children and Demera, the lageraltester, the head of the of the camp, the Jewish head of the camp, was afraid that his child and his children who were badly...who were well treated, they had enough to eat...the Germans gave them enough to eat, but that they would would be gassed, so he persuaded...uh he told the SS look...we have the children. They're not working. I mean they're parasites. We need to have children, the children work. And a column was created, a kommando was created, consisting only of children. The kapo was Mr. Klepich (ph) from Paris, the deputy kapo was Mr. Bornstein (ph) from Warsaw...I knew them well...I happened to know them well...and for some reason which I cannot recall, I had...1 was thrown out of my kommando. It was a bad work...I don't know what I did, and nobody wants to have me in his kommando, so being during the roll call pushed from one...one kommando to the other, I landed at the children's kommando which had the first day...which was...had it's first day, and since I knew that the the the kapo and his deputy, they took me in. I don't know what right they had to take me in but I had somebody else to throw me out or push me out from their kommando. I was with the children's kommando, and so we walked on this day...that was in October 1943..-with the children to work. Now the children...the SS on both sides with its sticks and with whips and its machine guns and all the five thousand people in this __ this way and the thirty children. Now when we met the other prisoners, the French prisoners, the British prisoners, everybody started to shout and to to whistle and to call shame on the Germans and the SS itself was embarrassed and they did react, so we walked with the children to our assigned working place and there somebody uh uh a kapo appeared and said the children have to do the following. There are stones on this side of the road and they have to bring the stones to the other side of the road, and he disappeared and we were alone.</p><p>And some of the children started to work and took the stones and brought them to the other side and other children knew that they were in concentration camps. They were between six and twelve years old. Whatever the little boy and a charming little boy called Malich (ph) and he didn't recognize that he was in a concentration camp. He wanted to play, so when we came to this place and the other children were...brought stones from one side to the other, he played. He played. He had...there was a broken down machine. It was a plane or something...a steam engine. He played there, and suddenly there came a young SS man whom I had never seen and he liked this boy and he started to play with Malich and then he started to carve out of wood which was laying around, little things which he...little toys and gave it to to Malich and then he said to me, isn't it a pity. Such a nice boy, but he is Jewish. He must die. Now the children's column had no tragic end I have to say. After a while the children gave up carrying the stone. The whole thing was was meaningless and they were staying around there, but it was October. It became...it was very, very cold. It became colder and colder and uh we didn't know what to do with ourselves and with the children and I remember they they were singing and they were singing two songs. One of the which is their home, and another song <span class="page-break" number="12"></span> 1 few have survived. I mean of the five thousand...I don't know what happened to the children, but nothing happened to them. The the the kommando was dissolved again.</p><p>(drinking) Now I want to tell you the story about the gallows. The SS beat people. The SS uh could take uh a stick or something, an iron bar and hit somebody and kill him.</p><p>Nothing happened. They were not called. They were not in any way responsible, but there was a very strange thing. The one...they hanged somebody and erected a gallow. A person was hanged upon order of the chief of the...no...the furher of the SS and chief of the German police. Furher of the SS and chief , and when somebody was <span class="page-break" number="13"></span> 2</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: One day we were...we were asked to load sheets of tin which were in front of a barrack and transport them to another barrack, so we loaded a few of these sheets on this little cart and started to walk towards the other barrack, and suddenly we heard behind us, sabotage, sabotage. In the factory, there was not only the SS. There was what was called Factory Gestapo, Work Gestapo, and they had noticed that we had loaded this, and they noticed that we transported it and behind the Gestapo came SS man. You dirty Jews. You traitors. You...and they started to shout sabotage, sabotage. And that was a very good example. I mean in general, , generally they beat us why. Because we didn't <span class="page-break" number="14"></span> 3 death. They had his number and they called all the people together and would uh...they could...they called all the people together and suddenly would read...his first name was Sam Johnson...uh number so and so...sentence death for sabotage, so we were afraid for for many weeks thereafter that we would be called...that there would be another hanging and then they would call us and say we are sentenced to death, so we got out of this. But it was not only an extraordinary experience, very extraordinary experience...I think there are a few people who considered under the gallows but walk today. Now it's difficult to give you other highlights if there are other highlights in the life of the camp, but I must say, our enemies were the SS, hunger... even so we were much better fed than the County Vernet. We were working hard and even if we were not working hard, I mean sixteen hours. I mean I tried to work as little as possible but still uh so there was hu...the SS was the main enemy. There was hunger and there was a short thing and that was the bombing.</p><p>The bombing came...came later. Uh this was one of the most strategic factories in Germany and when the Allies had advanced far enough in northern Italy so that they could fly from northern Italy to Upper Salasia and back, they started to bomb.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: OK. Linda's saying we don't have time for this story. We'll wait until the tape changes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>Linda, what would you like him to...(pause)...oh, OK. Oh, OK. She said this is going to be the end of the tape, so would you talk about hiding when everybody left on the death march.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Let me say one thing whether it's on the tape or not. This bombing is important to be mentioned because at this...in this connection, they bombed deliberately or not Auschwitz I and the whole story about why have Auschwitz not been bombed...it has been bombed and I know witnesses. I have... mean Auschwitz bombed...that was Auschwitz II. And uh uh the second thing I want to say about this bombing, it's ridiculous to say they should bomb the the the the railroad tracks. We worked on the railroad tracks. You can...if they were destroyed or damaged, you could have restored them in a couple of days.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Please talk about hiding when the death marches came.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: OK. Uh on the fourteenth of January, 1945, the Russian offensive started and that was I think from Warsaw towards the , and we knew that contrary to the landing of the of <span class="page-break" number="15"></span> 4 what to what to say, and finally on the...well, the the battle came near. We heard the guns and these were the guns of liberation. We knew this...over there. These were ominous guns. These were the liberators or we are...we are dying, and uh then we heard...I think it was the eighteenth of January, Auschwitz, Auschwitz I is being evacuated and uh the evacuees marched towards...are being marched towards the west, and on the eighteenth or nineteenth of January, some five thousand uh...some five thousand concentration camp people from eastern camps came into into uh Blechhammer...into into our camp. They were exhausted. Some of them were dying or they they fell down. We didn't know whether they're dying or not, and the next day the order was given that we should be evacuated and then I said to myself...then we said among us OK, we are going to march together and then we are going to run away, if we can, but when they started to evacuate I had second thoughts and I said, now or never. I'm not going to be evacuated but I didn't know what to do, and walking through the...they pushed people towards the roll call place uh square and you could see once you were in the crowd, you were surrounded by the SS. You couldn't get out of this, and I started to try to stay outside but suddenly an SS man, an SS man caught me and shouted I should go to the roll call place and he had two hand grenades and he always threatened he would...he would throw them at me, but I knew...I didn't run. He started...run, run, run. I didn't run because I knew if he threw it at me, he would be...he would be hit too by his own grenade, so he pushed me towards the crowd. He didn't push me in and again I got out of this cro...out of the perimeter...of the peripheral of the crowd and I tried to find a place to hide and I found another uh man whom I knew from uh from Vernet who was also out looking for a place to hide, and we came to the sick bay and the sick bay was separated from the camp. You could only go in if if. a certain gate was opened and there was...there was a man standing whom I hated. I hated him because he had been a male nurse called...kind of male nurse to the people who were dying. He wasn't much of a male nurse but he was part of the inmate...he was an inmate. He was stealing their bread, and I guess he felt that I didn't like him, but coming to this gate together with my buddy, he said do you want to come in. We said yes. So he opened the gate and this is...we want to get into hiding, but not with the sick, and he said there's an empty barrack, so we came to a barrack and he opened the door. It seemed to be full of chairs. I don't know where the chairs came from. Full of chairs. It seemed you cannot get in, but when we investigated more closely, we found it wasn't so full and we entered this this barrack. On the other side of the barrack, there was a little window.</p><p>There we made room for ourselves, my buddy and I and then there was a third person whom...a young boy who had been entrusted to him but not a child anymore. He was fourteen, fifteen years. There were hiding so we made a hiding place and then we arranged the chairs...where they came from I don't know...in such a way that if you opened the door from the other side... <span class="page-break" number="16"></span> 5 Tape #2</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Linda's asking if you can take the handkerchief out of your hand? I don't think you even have it now. He doesn't...he doesn't have it. OK. Please start with the shooting when the people tried to attack the food barrack.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Alright. The people who had remained in the camp were the people who had come on the first hunger march...some of them remained in the camp, perhaps two thousand, discovered that there were food barracks...there were barracks full of food, magazines, and started to attack them and tried to get in to get food and they were repelled by the SS which uh shot many of them and many of them were in front of our little window and we saw them , laying there and some had friends who brought them back and others <span class="page-break" number="17"></span> 6</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Closet. Opened a closet and the body of this woman fell out and I said who put them...who put her in there, and they said we. Can you imagine...how can you eat with a dead person around you. Well, to make the story short, we were there...the camp was surrounded by the battle between the Russians and the Germans and after some adventures to which I don't want to go into now, on the Thursday...the whole story started on a Saturday...Sunday the SS left I think on Monday or on Sunday...on the following Thursday, we had moved into a little little barrack which had been a workshop. There were...there were hammers there and so on, and uh we were three in this...we heard shouts at midnight and uh this friend of mine, this colleague of mine believed the Russians uh have come. He spoke Polish and hardly any Russian but he tried to find some Russian words and said finally, finally you are here, finally you come, and we heard from the other side, out, out, out, you damn...the Germans were back. And uh this little barrack where we had been, now the little workshop was somehow on the side and this German soldier came and knocked at the door and said out, out. We were quiet and we had...there were some hammers there. If he had entered, we would have killed him. I think the first and only time in my life...we would have killed him and for us it was a terrible feeling. We had believed...we had believed we are free, and here they were again.</p><p>He was afraid to enter. He was afraid to enter and uh he left. Then they took some of those people who had still been in the camp...not all of them...along and they shot them outside, and we said to ourselves we cannot stay here any longer. We have to leave. So the next morning, the battle was going on. We left through the main gate. We saw the SS a couple of hundred yards away and we run into a forest. We run through this forest and we came to a village and this village was the village of Blechhammer. Before we came there, we saw some dead uh inmates who had done the same thing as we. Somebody shot them, and as we came into the main street of uh this little village, we saw British prisoners of war running through the main street and French prisoners of war and other prisoners, former obviously prisoners so we run with them and run and run and suddenly were Russians soldiers and they run further and we were free.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The SS didn't make any attempt to stop you as you ran out of the camp?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, because they were engaged with the Russians, you know. We were secondary at this point.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Linda, what would you like to ask? (Pause - Linda talking). Linda would like you talk very briefly about where you went after liberation, how you met Linda again and how you got to this country. Elizabeth...I'm sorry.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes. After liberation, we went uh...I went first uh to a place called Chesta...Chestahova (ph) but the Russians had even uh repatriation camp, but they were incapable of organizing it and uh from there I went to Krackow and uh we walked to Krackow. It was deep winter. It was very cold, and we always went to peasants and asked for the possibility of sleeping there and they always gave us food. They didn't have much <span class="page-break" number="18"></span> 7 themselves. In Krackow, there was such famine that we decided...that in Krackow, there was...yeah...there was such famine that we decided foolishly...I say we...there was a boy from Czechoslovakia, there were always other...other people we were with. We are going across the mountains to Czechoslovakia. Now that was completely foolish. How could we go across...in winter across very high mountains. It turned out that we hadn't realized there was a wall there which was not high enough and we walked through this wall and we came to Czechoslovakia. We came to Slovakia. There we met Jewish people who had been hidden and they helped us and from there we went very slowly as the Russians moved westward, we moved westward and at the end of April, at the beginning of May we were in Moravia and was back in Brun and my...the the boys we went with me went to Prague and it was the end of the war. I stayed one year still in Czechoslovakia. I had a very uneasy feeling. You had...it was the beginning of Communism, but it wasn't yet Communism. It was democratic. But there were many arbitrary things happening and I had a feeling you cannot stay here, so...and uh shortly after having arrived in Prague, I got in touch with Elizabeth indirectly. I learned she was alive and in 19...so I stayed still one year in Prague. I studied in Prague. I didn't study much but I went to the University, and in 1946 I got a three-day British transit visa to go to go via Britain to the United States. While...my daughter was in Britain and she got this transit visa for three days. The British were very decent. Out of the three days, there were one and a half years. And then Elizabeth came to England. We married in England in 1947. She being an American citizen could claim me outside the quota because at this time it was very difficult to go to the United States. You were on a quota which depended on your place of birth. Since my place of birth was Austria, the quota was over filled...overfull, and so in uh in February 1948 I came with a ship called Ernie Pyle to New York while there was big sand I got a job. I started immediately to to register at the University. I worked during the day and in the evening I went to school. I made my MA in 1950. I went to Johns Hopkins University where I was junior instructor for one year, and then I felt I have enough of academia. I need a job and since Baltimore and Johns Hopkins was near Washington, I went to Washington. I got a job in the Treasury but I would have had to wait for two months to start the job. I got a temporary job in the Department of Agriculture and I never left. Well, I left after thirty-nine years. I worked in the Department for eight years until "59 and in "59 I went overseas to first to Germany where I was at the American Embassy, then to Brussels where I was for ten years Agricultural Attache to the Common Market, a year's mission. Then to Geneva where I was in the big trade negotiations called the Tokyo , the head of the agricultural delegation, of the American agricultural <span class="page-break" number="18"></span> 8</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right. Uh the feeling was blank because I mean we were all the time, all the time...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: OK. Start...start from....the...like that that little story. Make a separate little story. Can you...she wants you in other words to go back and say you were almost hanged...I was almost hanged because...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, uh shall I describe how they put us under under this pole, cement pole...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We were under the cement poles and I didn't quite believe it was happening and I think my colleagues who were with me had the same feeling. It was the unbelievable and it was strange that it was an unbelievable feeling because we had been confronted so often before in the camp with the...with the...with the threat of death. Perhaps it was...we we didn't...we we refused mentally and psychologically to accept it because when we had been confronted with the danger or with the risk of being killed, it was just a risk, but here it was so to speak an ultimate risk and this ultimate risk seemed to be unacceptable, you know. There was no hope that when you are hanged...when they start to hang you, uh then then you are dead. That it was...at the other occasions there was always a chance even if you were wounded or injured, to to escape somehow. So uh it was not the feeling which has been described in literature... saw my whole life before eyes...it it it was the opposite of a supreme moment subjectively. Objectively it was. You know, it's like... am sorry. I have to go back to the bombing. I was more or less I would say courageous but I was afraid of the bombs and sometimes I had...I was panic...I was panicky in spite of the fact that objectively was not as dangerous then as other occasions where it was <span class="page-break" number="19"></span> 9 beat us and the kapos made our life miserable and some...and some of the kapos killed even, and they were Jews. Now if...there is no excuse to...for to say that they were forced to do this. They were not forced. I could have been a kapo too. I think would have lasted two days or a day, but they were not forced to do it. True, they improved their fate. They had the chance...they they increased the chance of survival. That is true, but they were not forced. There is no moral excuse and it's quite interesting that nobody speaks about this and it was not the same as the, as the...you know, in the in the so-called Judenrat (ph) when the Germans asked them to assign people for a transport. What should they have done? They could assign or they were...they were going themselves, but the kapos, it was different. The kapos pushed us because they got more food. The kapos forced us to work hard and the kapos enforced us by beating us, and that's no glorious page in the Holocaust story and very little is said about it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. You had also mentioned that the man with the stamps saved your life twice. I don't recall you talking about it a second time. I remember you said that he brought you to his kommando and saved your life...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, twice. Twice, because first of all he...he saw to it that I got a double ration of food.</p><p>That was once and then I was in his column...in his kommando where he didn't...he didn't let me work I mean, so I recovered. Incidentally, uh at the...at one point he started to shout at me...later on...shout at me and beat me, slapped me in front of everybody and I was quite , and threw me out of his kommando and two weeks later he had <span class="page-break" number="20"></span> 0 finished but by and large only have write and write and write.</p></p></dialogue>
