<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, it was...it was an average life. We had a...we lived in a nice town. Panemon was a small community. It consisted of one long street with a few alleys. And it was the gateway to which were...were summer homet3 B for the people who lived in Kovno.</p><p>They used to come over to spend their weekends in the woods and the forests where they had built summer homes. Also was real close by and it was beautiful beach and we used to spend our weekends there and it was real nice before the war. And then in 1940, when the Russians took over Lithuania..*uh...we didn't have any more Hebrew schools and we had to go to Yiddish schools and that's when we started g ~ learning Yiddish. I think Hebrew was outlawed or something. And I studied there for | year in a different school until the Germans came in. And...well...uh...we could talk a little bit...uh...about that one year.</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Ya. Tell us about that. Well, uh my father had to leave his business because uh you couldn't be a businessman under the _--_ Russian regime, and he tried to get a job several times and had difficulties because he didn't belong to any party, and he was not involved in politics. And being...having been in business before the war, it was a little difficult to get a job. So we kind of struggled through that year, but it wasn't too bad. We made it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>And...uh...and then in 41,when the Germans took over, that's when all Hell broke loose, so to speak. Uh...First of all, I remember like it was yesterday. It was on a Sunday morning. And I had sat up until 4:00 in the morning making some names for my...for my...for the uniforms of my basketball team. I was about |4years and I was...at 4:00 in the morning when I was extremely tired I went to bed. And at 6:00 in the morning, I was woken and told that the Germany invaded Russia and they're going to be in our town any day, the German army, and we have to leave because that may save our lives. So we had a horse and wagon. My father...uh...got it all together and we packed some of our belongings and took all...took my ...well, my whole family which consisted of my brother, my mother and my father and also my grandfather from my mother's side. And we just started toward Russia. Uh...We...I don't remember exactly how long it took us...a day or so to get to a small town. I believe that town was where my father was born and I think it was named...I'm not really very sure. And that is when the Germans met us and the border was closed, and there was no need to go any further. So we walked into the first abandoned home we found, probably was a Jewish home, other people who ran away, and we decided to stay overnight and see what happens the next day. And in the meantime, I remember...uh...a few hours later, we heard some knocks on the doors, vicious knocks...uh...by the Germans and they were looking for Jewish people I believe.</p><p>They were yelling there were any Jews hiding here and naturally, we admitted that we were Jewish. So I remember they were kind of...a little vulgar and then they asked...uh...what time it was. One incident, and my brother kind of being proud of his Bar Mitzvah watch showed...showed him the watch and told him what time it was. They said, "Well, give me that watch immediately." And my brother kind of resisted, so when the Germans start pulling up his rifle, my mother went over grabbed his watch...grabbed my brother's watch and just handed it over real fast. And this was our first introduction to the German army Then the next day, I believe, we saw that there was no use to hang around. There was no use to stay in that little town. We still had our horse, our wagon and some of our belongings and we headed back home back to Panemon, through Kovno.</p><p>On the road, they had....some Lithuanian army, I believe it was, had set up a place where they intercepted all the refugees who had tried to leave and tried and kept them...stopped all of us and told us to move over to that particular, big huge place it was on the road.</p><p>And they just kept us there for no reason at all. We...we spent a few nights there I believe outside on the ground, sky. It wasn't too bad. It wasn't cold...cold. It was summertime.</p><p>And no...no one knew what the future's going to bring. But after that I remember...1 believe that they took us to the Seventh or drove us to the Seventh the whole family.</p><p>Exactly I don't remember how it happened, but I remember that our next stop was the Seventh Fort in Lithuanian.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell us about the Seventh Fort.</p></p></dialogue>

It may have been some kind of a military defense area or something like that, but it was pretty green...pretty and they separated immediately the men and the women. Uh...I remember that my brother was 7 years older than I was, and when my grandfather went with my father on my one side, and my mother and I...they took us in another area of the Seventh Fort. I was 11 years old at that time. And we spent...and we spent...the exact amount of days...I don't remember how many days we spent there, but I...1 remember that right before they took us to the Ninth Fort, and the Ninth Fort was a similar place as the Seventh Fort in Lithuania, they had given them an order to some of the younger...uh...younger people who were with the meant to...to go to the women's side, and I...someone told you...that I think the order was that all the children up to about 15 or 16 could go to the women's side and my brother tried to go over. I don't know, he probably thought maybe it is safer and my father may have told him to do 60.And...uh...they didn't let him through because they said he looked older. Actually, he was 18. And he looked older, and they didn't let him in...let him go to...to...uh...his mother. And...and right after that we heard and knew that everyone was shot over there.</p><p>All the men were shot, but my father was not there. This is another long story. My father was a volunteer in the Lithuanian army. I believe when Lithuania in 1916 or something like that, he volunteered in the Lithuanian army to defend the...the country. And while Lithuania was independent between 1916 and I believe1940, these volunteers took a in certain prominent Close Lithuanian life. They were ...and they were honored many times.</p><p>My father had medals of it, and we were pretty proud of it. Uh...So before they told all the youngsters or after to go to another side, to the women's side, they also announced that everyone who was...they called themselves and those are volunteers. Every man who was a volunteer in the Lithuanian army to present themselves to the Lithuanian...uh., soldiers who probably did the massacre afterwards, and that they would take them out of there. And indeed, they did. They took them to a different place, which was called the...the Yellow Prison. They called it the Yellow Prison in Kovno. And I know that my father was there. So at that time my father was not shot. It was only my brother and my grandfather. Then the...and....uh...my father was...uh...in that prison I remember. And later on when we were released from the Ninth Fort, after being there...uh...and..-uh...my father came home one day and...uh...he...we asked him how he did that. He was in prison.</p><p>And he said he had promised the guard officers uniform and boots if he would let him go to see his family. He said, "Well, I'll let you go, but you better be back." And my father came to visit us. He spent a few hours with us and my mother begged him, I remember that. She begged him not to go back because it's not going to be there very good place.</p><p>We knew about that. And...uh...he did go back, and...uh...they were shot over there also.</p><p>They were shot. We heard all kinds of stories. Who knows why? But, we really don't know why. We really hoped and thought that being...being Xo the volunteers they were and respected before the war, the Lithuanian army who really directed most of these...uh...I don't know how to call it...uh...would...would really let them free, but they didn't. Uh...well, after...after this, we...uh...went to the ghetto. They...when the orders came, they told the Jews have to leave their towns...their towns and homes and belongings. Well, not all the belongings, but...uh...that you couldn't take with you and move to that designated area around Kovno which was called the ghetto. And my mother and I...we just took the things that we had. Couldn't...tried to exchange our home with</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Some people did. Some people gave up big mansions for little homes, and...uh...they moved in there, but there was not enough room for everyone so they...people who had those homes took in their families, their friends, whoever needed it, and we were sharing. I and my mother, we shared a room with a neighbor of ours who...uh...was...we were close before the war and...uh...that lady had also lost her son and her husband, and her daughter, who was my brother's age and I think they were friends...uh...had a room that they acquired somehow from some relatives or friends in one of those houses, and they took us in and we...shared one room, the four of us.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can you...can you go back. You had told me before that while your father was in prison your mother had taken his papers and tried to do something?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. Well...well, my mother always cherished papers, a being the, that volunteers...and his medals. And that was...we tell that was a precious thing because most of the...most of our encounter all the misfortunes that we had until then were always caused by Lithuanian soldiers. And we didn't see that many Germans around at the beginning. I'm sure they gave all the orders. They were involved. But I we didn't see them. So we felt...she felt especially that those papers and medals may come in handy someday. She always kept them on her. Uh...Well...there's so much to talk about...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You had gone ahead and you are in the ghetto now?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, I'm in the ghetto now. But...uh...there was another incident that if I may I should back up a little but that's always stuck with me too is when...when the Russians came in, although we were not in great shape financially either, but my father since he was a volunteer and he was in the army, he kind of had respect for some...for the Lithuanian Army...for the Lithuanian army before the war. And he was friendly with some...uh...people in high command. And he find out where we lived there a general who was I think the Chief of Staff of the Lithuanian army and when the Russians came in they sent him to Siberia. And...and he had left his wife and children in our town, and my father knew them. And I remember that whenever he could, he used to take some packages over there or even lumber to heat the homes because in Lithuania most of the homes were heated by lumber, good lumber. And he...he was quite friendly with them and tried to help that particular year. And right after the Germans occupied Lithuania right before the ghetto, we were sitting in this lady's house, Mrs. Mudrick was her name, and...uh...just talking about the future in the ghetto and things like that, where we're going to move homes or whatever and I...I looked through the window. It, it was about two houses away from ours in Panemon, and I looked through the window and here was the General walking with his wife and was going back to their home in the...on the... They lived...they had a home in the outskirts of Panemon. And I kind of felt a great feeling because I felt this is one man who probably could help release my father from that Yellow prison that he was in. And I pointed her out to my mother, "Look who's walking by here. Why don't you go out and talk to him really quickly. I'm sure he knows us.</p><p>Especially...she knows us, and maybe they can do something," my mother went out real quick. I was with her and I remember that for a minute they acted like...like...they didn't</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And...uh...she told them who we were and they nodded and she begged them to see if they'Il...can do something about releasing my father. But needless to t say, nothing happened. That is one incident that stayed with me.</p><p>Uh...Alright, I guess now the next thing is the ghetto.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell us again which ghetto you were in and how did you get there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, from what I remember it was quite simple. We just walked or...or took a bus or something. I really don't remember exactly how we got there. Maybe on a wagon? No, I cannot. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I know that we were there in 1941, and I was!1 years old with my mother and she had arranged to live in that room with Mrs. Widrick and her daughter, Rita.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You are not in Kaunas. You are in Kovno.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, Kaunas and Kovno is the same thing. Kaunas is in Lithuania. Uh, well, from the beginning, I remember there was Aktions. They called for 500 people, and they called four thousand people to work, and they called for all kinds of things. And some came back, some people didn't come back, but those things did...did not affect me personally because, as I said, you know, being young, you...you don't understand a lot of things. I 12 know...my...my mother used to go to work every day in a brigade. I don't remember exactly what she was doing and, but then we tried...we tried our best to survive.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you see any of the roundups?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Uh...Not, not exactly. I seen a lot of roundups. Iseena _lot of brigades going in and out, but...uh...there  weren't...I could not distinguish between the ones who went and came back and the ones who went and didn't come back. Uh I was a go-for when I was about 12, 13 years old, I became a go-for for the administration in the ghetto.. running around with papers, back and forth to offices...And...uh...I thought maybe...I really don't remember what I was thinking. I...1 was just doing what I was told to do, After...and...and that's it. When I was about 14 I believe, I started to work in a...in a clay factory where weQ 5 * 2 used to manufacture pottery, clay...out of clay. And that factory was run by afamily of qenerations of...of pottery makers, and they were very experienced and dida very beautiful job.;5 ft</p></p></dialogue>

And I guess the boss orthe leader of that factory had heard that there's ata selection...they're rounding up all the children. Well, hewas kind of concerned about me...uh...and he said, "Well, wegonna...since they're rounding up children we're going to;:ao put you to work and make you look important. So let's seeif...what we can do about it." I don't know...I don't knowif I understood what was happening, what our destiny was, but he all of a sudden put me next to his old uncle who wast 9 @t the best pottery maker, a real artist, and he put me rightnext to him to knead...knead the clay to prepare the clay ..for him to put on that machine and he was making the pots and vases and things likethat. And I remember two~3 ;6tUkrainian soldiers walked in. They looked around.</p><p>They didn't see any children untilthey spotted me. And they walked up to me and they said, "How old are you?" And! 14 believe I said, "I was about 14." Maybe I was 15.</p><p>Maybe I was 14." And onesaid to me, "Come with us."

A minute later the German appeared, the Germancommandant.</p><p>And the way it was situated was like/ 4 ag3 this. The gate of the small ghetto was the end of one street. The whole thinghappened...the way it happened was like a interception from which four or fivestreets...streets branched out. The German commandant wastX 40 standing in the middle of the interception. The gate was on one street. About 90degrees of that gate was the fence of the big ghetto from which we had come. No gate.3ust barbed wire fence with German guards and the Jewish policea ff n an the other side of it, pretending to watch what'shappening or to guard or whatever they were doing there. a&gt;&gt;a Xs Probably seeing what was happening. knothes German was J b SLt standing there,the lieutenant ran over quickly, took the medal the papers, and walked over to theGerman commandant and he talked to hiw. What he said I don't know, but I heard theGerman yell, "Where are those Jews? Where are those Jews?" So he ran...he came overquickly and got us and...uh...my mother walked up to him quickly and told...ff 40 repeated her story, and he said, "Back in the ghetto." And we could see...before I gotto the fence, I could see the 3ewish police...there was no entrance, but the Jewishpolice16; 65r who were on the other side tore the barbed wire with their hands and their feet,tore apart...made a hole, and we just crawled back in. And...uh...that day 10,000people died.sUD One of the nen who vent was a cousin who we really hadn't 20 seen, but we learned afterwards that she was there.

From what I understand is thatthere may have been a few othersIn C~) who hid in attics or some other places that day instead of going to the Ninth Fort,and I think when somebody told me afterwards...when the Jewish police and the firemencame i io check they found some people hidden and later got them out of there.

And to protect us because out of 50 kids someone had to see that they were jumping out and not to tell the Germans that would have been the end of every one of us. So we decided with them that they're going to jump and in about a couple of hours later, we would pretend...we would be about...and...100 miles away...120 miles away from that area...a couple of hours later, we would pretend that we just saw the kids jump, and we would tell the German guards that here two kids have jumped out and here they are.

They were from the Wehrmacht, so...so you could speak to them once in awhile. They would...I remember someone was talking to them about knives, about other/3 61) things. I don't remember the conversation. About we were watching the homes or the greenery while the train was going by. We just talked to them and kept them busy. And all of a sudden, like we said, about two hours later, one kid ran up to us and started to pretend that he's telling me a?</p><p>bao secret~ And they got excited and they asked whatts happened. We said, "Go look quick. Quick. Through that window, the port hole, two kids just jumped out." First, they didn't believe it and then they kinda looked and then3 AO they said, "Well, it took you too long. They were right there." And thirdly, they started to call the officer somehow and made some signs that we should stop the train reco+(tm)blc and to recount them because if they took them to , we/ # 61D were missing. Now that took a little while. And they30stopped the train. They took us all out and they counted us three times, and two were missing. SO they...they asked us,Where did it happened. And they said, "About five minutes# dD ago, they all jumped out, and we reported it, we saw it."And okay, from what I understand they did call the localpolice in that town, but that may have had been 10towns...those kids were about 10 towns behind us...andthey...they were looking for them.

They were a lot of kommandos,people who used to go to work every day and come back.
