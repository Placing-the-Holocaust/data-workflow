<body><dialogue class=""><p>SAM SPIEGeL May 3, 1995</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: My name is Samuel Spiegel. I was born in , Poland on August the 23rd, <span class="page-break" number="0"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: A little bit. | was younger. I don't remember exactly, but I know he was involved in organizations quite a lot.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you ever experience any attacks or any --?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Usually around Easter or Christmas time, the Jewish people used to be a little bit afraid and they used to lock their doors because what they preached mostly in the churches.</p><p>When they come home and they have a couple drinks or so, things were pretty rough, but otherwise we didn't have any problems.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you aware of what was going on in Germany at this point?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, we were aware very little of what was going on in Germany. Even when the Germans came in, we figured it's a war maybe things are going to change a little bit, but they closed in every time, there came some new rules out and it got to be very bad for the Jewish people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How large was your town?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Our town had about close to 10,000 population. 4,500 of it were Jews, close to 50 percent.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Business and that was fairly integrated?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, you told me when the Germans came into in your town and bomb fell on your house, what was going on?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: September the Ist?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes, what was happening?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We ran out from the house, then we had to get another place to live. I think we moved in with our grandmother for a little while in a room just to stay until things straightened a little bit out. Then when they moved us in and we stayed there for a while, and I got sick in 1940, I had the typhus, and I was lucky they put me away in a separate room and nobody found out about it, and I survived somehow the typhus. Then I worked for the Jewish Community Center at home, because the Germans, when they made the Ghetto, made like the Judenaut which was a self -- you know the Jews governed themselves and I worked in the office over there for them, until I sent away to , to the slave <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> some little things we could trade for food with the farmers from the outside and I even had a paper that I could go outside of the Ghetto, because I worked in the office and I worked in the labor department, in that section. I could see what started going on and I was very, very upset with all those things, and I figured that I couldn't stay over there too long, and I decided to get out and when I went to to the camp, this was before they took all the Jewish people out from our town. The fellow that took me out from there was an SS man by the name of . He said we have to go to</p><p> , because there's a big ammunition factory and we'll have to send a lot <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> difference.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you see that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, sure, absolutely. I remember the name. He was a Ukrainian, not really an SS, by the name of Schmitky, they used to call him. He was a very, very cruel man. He just came out. I remember right near our house there was a fellow, his name was Littman, Phil Littman was his name, and I remember he shot him right in front of our house. We were sitting inside. We were afraid even to go out. So those things were going on daily. It was a daily occurrence. It wasn't new.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did your father keep up any this organizing underground, the Zionism?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I couldn't say because I don't remember and I don't think so. It's true that they got together and they talked about certain things, but very little could be done, because there was no help from the outside. In the Ghetto without help from the outside, it was very hard to organize anything, especially in a small town like ours.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you observe shobot, holidays, anything?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We used to observe it in the way we could. I remember my mother used to light candles every Friday, but as far as the food was concerned, we didn't have the food that we had before the war. If you had a little piece of bread and some potatoes it was enough just to survive. I used to help a little bit because I worked in the Judenaut and I had maybe my portion a little bit more so I usually used to bring it home instead of eating so I can help out the family a little bit.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell me a little about the Judenaut, how you got that job?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The way I got the job was the fellow who was running the Judenaut, was a very good friend of my father's, and that's how I got the job. It wasn't easy to get a job like this, because usually when you work for the Judenaut and you're over there and all the food and everything came in, you always had a little bit more that you can have a little piece of bread more to eat, but I usually didn't eat it myself. I brought it home, because I knew the rest of the family needed it more than I did, because they didn't have any other means to get their food from.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What other privileges did you get from working there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: The privileges that I had was that I wasn't called to work every day, that I was at home, and I worked in the office, and I had special papers that even I could walk outside of the Ghetto, if I had to go out for something. If you get out from the Ghetto, because you mix with the Gentile people outside, you could help yourself a little bit more. <span class="page-break" number="3"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Were you able to help your family by virtue of your position other than the food?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, not much. I had a younger brother, which I send him out to work one time, which they worked at , and it was named , the firm. But <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> people we want to go, because you know there is always somebody who is a little better off or have other people, and we were watching out that the people in the position to help other people they should stay in place to help them, instead of sending them out of town.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can you give me any more ideas how they choose these 200 people versus another 200?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Usually we try to take them according to alphabetical order, so we really, I don't think we made choices you know this person is going to go and this person is not going to go. I mentioned that there were certain people who were privileged. If he had some in his family, you know, he didn't send them out to a certain job that was very hard. He picked them out to go to a job that was a little easier. I imagine everybody did the same thing. If I could help some of my friends, I helped them. If I could help somebody else.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were there women in the Judenaut?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, not too many that I can remember.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you aware of any sort of manipulation of the Judenaut toward other people because of their special power?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't remember. There might have been in the higher echelon, but I wasn't in the higher echelon to be able to tell you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The Judenaut also took care of food and everything else?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's right. They used to dispense the food. They used to get it, and then divide it. The people used to have little carts that you used to come to collect your food, once a week or twice a week. We also had soup kitchens that we set up in order to help the people that didn't have a place to cook or couldn't help themselves.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Anything else about the Ghetto that you can think of?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: The Ghetto was very, very bad, and lot of people when they had people who hardly had anything, if they heard about a good job that was outside, that the Germans took you away, they wanted to go because the Germans never told you that they were going to take you to a concentration camp or somewhere else. They said we have here, we need some people to send out the job. We're going to take you and you're going to be living over there and you're going to be all right. So, a lot of people even went by themselves because they figured they would be better off than being in the Ghetto because the Ghetto was very bad. You didn't have enough to eat and there was a lot of starvation and sickness going on. We didn't know really until later on what was going on in the concentration camps, because even I, myself, didn't believe until I got to Auschwitz that they're really gassing and burning people until I saw it myself. <span class="page-break" number="5"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So, you were already in ?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, in 1942 I was in , and I worked over there in the building section.</p><p>It was a very, very big place. We lived right in the factory. It was like a whole city. It was one of the largest ammunition factories in Poland. That's where I got to know my wife over there in 1942 because women and men were in the same camp. We lived in separate barracks, but we were in the same camp. The camp was really watched by a Ukrainian.</p><p>The Germans were in charge, but Ukrainians were watching our camp. It was pretty tough over there, but we had a little bit more to eat. We worked but we mixed with other nationalities. The Polish people worked in the same factory. At night time we used to come home and still see our friends and everybody else. We tried to help each other as much as we can. Let's say, if somebody could bring a little piece out from the outside and he could share it somebody else, he usually shared it with somebody else. We found out after the war that the fellow that was in charge of our camp over there, he was a German by the name of Brant, that thanks to him, that labor camp was a little bit better, that we didn't suffer as much as in other camps. He was caught after the war in the and he was telling the things that he was doing for us. I know when they took us away to Auschwitz, he went to Auschwitz and told them that , we were very <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> a liking to me. I learned a little bit of trade over there. By the end of 1944 I think it was in November, when the United States and the Russians started progressing more on Germany, and the Germans used to have their shops on the front lines in trains, and they bunked a lot of those trains, they brought a lot of our men to the train factory to be fixed.</p><p>The soldiers that were in those trains, came with them. They usually waited until the trains were fixed, so they put on another shift. Before they put on another shift, the SS man came in. His name was Fox. He said, each one he assigned us a train, a pullman to go out and check on those pullman. I went out to mine because I didn't know the train, but I knew how to write and read and I made a plan of the train and I showed him where the damage was and what we're going to fix. When he came on and asked everybody what to do, he came to me and after I showed him those, he says you're going to run the second shift. I couldn't tell the men. I took the bull by the horn. I figured listen I had to take a chance because I had different nationals working under me in the second shift. We went out to work, and we did the job so fast that we got a little bit tobacco extra and I never smoked. Usually everything I got, I shared it with the people. They knew that I didn't know the trade, but they couldn't tell the men that I don't know it either as long as I was put in charge, I was put in charge over the train. That's where I learned my trade.</p><p>When I came to the United States, that's the trade I went into, and I built up a shop in Washington DC and thank God I was very successful, and that's how I made a living in the United States when I came over here.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I want to learn a little bit more detail about some of these camps, these labor camps. Your interaction with the other people, with the guards, what your daily life was like?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In concentration camp we didn't have any interaction with the guards. You're very, very scared of them. I'm going to tell you an incident which happened to me. I worked in the sheet metal shop, and I used to make things out of little pieces of copper that I used to find, other things, some rings. I used to exchange them for little pieces of bread. I was called one day, and this was about the end of November 1944, and the men took my number and usually every Sunday the persecutions were going on, because we didn't work. Anybody did something that they didn't like, they used to hang them and then send them away to the crematoriums.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: This is which camp?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Auschwitz. And I already knew what was going to happen. I figured my gosh how can I get out of it. I knew what was going to happen to me on Sunday because I was caught with materials that , which means they are materials they use during <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> weeks in order to have it for you as a present and I would like you to have it. It went away, I never heard any thing more about it. They never called me. The commander got to know me very well because we went out through the gate a lot of times. He used to knock me on the shoulders when we went out. That's how I survived from going to the crematoriums one time. We had to think sometimes. When the Ghetto was liquidated, my whole family went to Treblinka, and they all perished in the crematorium in Treblinka.</p><p>That's what I found out at , a couple weeks later after I was there. <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> 0 the clothes and they gave us other clothes. But, we had selections every Sunday. They looked us through, and if somebody didn't look so good, they took them out and they send them away to the crematoriums. They brought in other people to replace them. The food we got in the morning, you had to get up about 4:00 in the morning and we stayed outside. They called it Appeal, that they counted us, every morning, and if somebody was missing, we had to stay outside, cold or rain didn't make any difference until the men were found. Because sometimes somebody died during the night and never even came out, or something happened, but we had to wait. And if they didn't count us, we didn't couldn't go to work until everything was counted. Then we had about five miles, maybe four miles that we would have to walk from the camp to the factory. The music was playing near the gate where we went out, and the music was playing at night when we came home. We got a little piece of bread, about six of us got one pound of bread. The bread was made out, you could feel the straw inside that you could hardly eat it, but we had to eat it because you had to survive on something. We got a little bit, it was like tea.</p><p>They said it was a special tea that was made that we drank a little bit. Then in the middle of the day you got a little bit of soup which was mostly water. Then at night, when we came home, either we got another little piece of soup or we got another little piece of bread. This was our food for a whole day. Things were very, very bad, because a lot of people, we didn't have enough food, they used to get diarrhea and they used to get sick.</p><p>The minute you got sick a little bit, you were taken out, and we alot of times when we went out to work and maybe 2,000 people, and the men says I only want 1,800 back and by the time we got back, we had trucks behind us that they killed off the rest of them. We just loaded on the truck the ones that couldn't keep up with --you know, because we walked from the factory to the thing. The ones that couldn't keep up with it, they killed them on the road, and they put them on the trucks and then they took them away to the crematoriums. But we couldn't help ourselves. We couldn't even escape because on the outside there was nobody to help us. I had a friend that escaped from the trains when they took us on the trains and got into the woods, and when he came back, he was taken to Treblinka at that time. His name was . I'll never forget. He came back, he said listen don't go on those trains because they burn you over there and we thought that the man was crazy. We didn't believe him. We said how can they tell living people and burn them especially you know in our days? And another thing that we couldn't understand it's as if the world would know that those things would go on, we are taught that somebody outside must know because if they would know what was going on in here, they couldn't sit outside and not do anything about it. But, we never got any help from the outside. When he was on the outside and was in the woods, he said he couldn't stay over there because they wanted to kill him because , so he <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> 1 this thing couldn't last on forever. But, it was very easy to commit suicide. All you had to do was through yourself on the wires, because the wires were electric. They had 600 volts in them. And a lot of people did it. But, if we found out that somebody was very despondent and we felt that he was going to do something, we tried to talk to him and tell him listen, the outside world cannot sit like t his and watch what's going on here and not do anything. It looks like the war is already coming to an end. We knew little things what were going on because we didn't have any radios. We didn't have any papers, and nobody was telling us anything because even the Germans that worked with us in the factory were afraid to talk to us, because if they noticed that they talk to us too much, they took him away. They took them away, too. So, we tried to help each other as much as we could in order to survive. And thank God some of us survived. When they took us out on the Death March --.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Wait a minute, we haven't talked about the Death March yet so we need to set that up.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: All right. One day, when we were , they came in and they said that they have to take us all out. They didn't take us where we were going. We found out later that this was the death march. We were only about 60 kilometers away from Auschwitz and all the people that were going met the same way. So, they took us out one morning. It was snowing in January, January the 22nd. It was snowing and it was very cold outside because over there the temperature goes about 30 degrees below zero. We didn't have any clothes. We didn't have anything with us, and we marched because they didn't have any trains to put us on, and anybody that couldn't keep up with the marchers were shot on the way. One night it was in January, I think it was the 25th of January, they brought us to a camp in , which was a big factory. They brought us in all over there <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> 2 woods for eight days in that cold weather and everything else, I can hardly remember. I know we had frozen toes and at night time we used to go out from the woods. In Europe they used to have to put away potatoes in the winter time outside and they used to cover them with sawdust and then have a door on the southside that they used to take the potatoes out. The sun used to come out during the day, so we stole some of those potatoes and we ate those raw potatoes and we had snow as water. That's how we lived through until we survived from those eight days. If you ask me to tell you anything about those things, I couldn't. But there were some other people in the woods too, when I was over there. I met a friend of mine, from my town, that escaped too, at the same time, by the name of David Bay, and he lives now in Washington, D.C., and we're still very close. We used to crawl one into the other one in order to keep us warm during the night until we got up the next morning. Then we used to run a little bit, you know, in order just to survive. Then from that time after, I walked home. It took me almost about two weeks to get home because there was no transportation. We could catch any transportation we could, and when I came home, -- so I was one of the ones who was liberated early. Even when I came back to my town--the reason I went back was because I thought maybe somebody from my family was alive still. I couldn't believe that everybody was gone that was there. There was no work, and no way to make a living, and I told you before that one of my father's friend's daughter was alive. She was on the Gentile side. She was not in a concentration camp. She was home already. I even got together with her I told her I said Tasha, we are only about seven Jewish people in the whole town that came back in those days when I was over there. Some of them even came from the Russian side already or there were Gentile papers. I said we have to do something in order to make a living. I said I'm going to put that flour mill back in operation. I did. I got the Gentile fellow, the machine shop, and we put it back in operation. We started -- the farmers used to bring in their corn, and we used to keep 50 percent for the making the flour and they used to keep the other 50 percent. That's how me made a living in those days. We have a little house over there. We remodeled a little bit and we moved in. I didn't know that Regina was alive still --.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: We need to stop here a moment. First of all, I want you to tell me what it was like when you went back to your home town after you were liberated. I mean you didn't go there and five minutes later you were a business man. What did you do? What did you find?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: When I came back to town, the first thing, we left a lot of things with a lot of people, with our neighbors. I couldn't get anything back, and I was afraid to get back because I figure when asking to give back they might do something to me. So, all the Jewish people that came back, we moved into one of our houses that my uncle used to have. And we stayed over there all together, and one of my cousin's survived too. She lives now in Belgium.</p><p>So, we all lived over there for quite a while, maybe for a couple, two or three months, but we had to go and get something to eat, because nobody gave us. We used to go to the government, but they themselves didn't have too much, but at least we had a little piece of bread to eat because we didn't need the things like you know like we live over here now. If we had a piece of bread and a couple potatoes, this was enough for us to eat. But <span class="page-break" number="11"></span> 3 we started to build up ourselves a little bit. But, I got sick. I had to go to the hospital. I had the infection. I was in the hospital for a little while, but when I came out and I got together with my father's friend's daughter, we decided that we had to do something. I didn't want to put it up as a business. I wanted to put it up so that we can make a living and the farmers needed us too. The farmers were after us to put the flour mill back in operation because that was the only flour mill around, maybe 50 miles around our community. The only one.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did your Polish neighbors treat you? Did they welcome you back?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not really. I hate to say it, but even with the friends that I went to school and everything else, I lived over there. I was born over there. My family lived over there for generations.</p><p>I don't know how many generations, but the first question when they saw me "You're still alive?" But, things are different now. I always tell them that I wish you would ask me if I lived in Holland, not in Poland. From the whole town, from the 4,500 that we lived in, I think maybe close to a 100 are alive and not all went to concentration camps. A lot of them ran away to Russia and they came back from Russia after the war. We still get together even during the summer, we have sometimes a gathering from our town that we get together, all of them together, to see how everything goes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, they weren't very kind to you when you got back?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, not too kind. And we had --I had to escape from there, because they started pogroms again. The pogroms started in and the day Regina came back she went to her town, and she went up to her apartment and knocked at the door to find out if some of her family may have come back. There was a fellow behind that said Regina run away because they just killed. . was a fellow that came back too from concentration camp, and they just killed him. So, she went down from that apartment and she didn't have time to get into her apartment house, then she came back to my town.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, we haven't even discussed Regina, so people watching the tape won't know who Regina is. You need to back track a little bit.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In the beginning, I think I said that I met Regina in in 1942, and <span class="page-break" number="12"></span> 4</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I was wondering when you were talking about your fiance coming to your town, did you think you'd see her again?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was hoping that I would because I knew I lost everybody else, but I was very happy to hear that she was still alive because I found out. News traveled, and maybe I should get back for someplace for her to come to, but we couldn't get married. What happens in the Jewish religion to get married you need ten people to have a witness to have a</p><p> . There weren't ten Jews even there to get married, but we got together the ones that were over there and we told them, that because she doesn't have a place where to live and I don't, we're going to move in together and we're going to get married the minute we can get married.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, describe to me when she came, when you saw her?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, it's very I was one of the happiest people because I figured she was the closest one to me, because I was with her for almost two years in together, and in</p><p> she lived in a different barrack, and I lived in a different barrack and one time I went over to visit her and one Ukrainian took me out from a room and I got 25 lashes and I'll never forget it, but it was worth it to see her.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You went to her barrack?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You went inside?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh, sure. You could go in. We didn't live together in the same barracks, but we lived in the same camp and the same camp you could go and visit them. But if the Ukrainian, if he wasn't a very nice fellow, he took you out and most of them were not nice and they just gave me a beating one of those times. He said it's too late, you should already be in your barrack not over here. Because I didn't have time to go when I got home from work anyhow. So, we knew in Poland that we couldn't stay over there no more. We'll have to leave this country. There's no place for Jews to live any more after what happened over there. So, one day, when I found out what was going on and I had a threat that they're trying to kill me so I went to the mayor of the town and I found out that he was one of the teachers that I used to go to school in my last years. His name was Peshko. He was in the underground. He was in the underground during the war. I went over to him and I told him Mr. Peshko, I have to leave. I lived through Hitler and I don't need this and I have to get a paper from you to get on the train because Russia was at that time in Poland and you couldn't just go on a train any time you wanted to. So, he said, Sam I'm going to give you a paper because we're trying to have a out on and <span class="page-break" number="13"></span> 5 in a little suitcase and I went out of town to another town to and took the train from over there. At that night we ended up on the Czechoslovakian border. They went through and they checked your passports on the Polish side. We went out from the train. We crawled under the train on both sides. Went out to the Czechoslovakian train and so when the Asians went out from their trains we went upstairs and wind up in Czechoslovakia. When we came to Czechoslovakia we came to I think and then we went to Prague. We got off the -- we took a street car to get into the town from the train and Regina thought that I had the little suitcase and I thought she had the little suitcase and we left it on the streetcar. So, we came to town to the main it was a station over there, a street car station, and I asked Regina do you have the suitcase? No, do you have it? No. So, I asked the fellow, we spoke a little bit Czechoslovakian because it's the same language a little bit similar to Polish, he said you wait here. It takes about three quarters of an hour for the street car to come back and I'm sure the little suitcase is going to be on it. We waited over there for three quarters and we had a little suitcase and we got it back, so we're lucky to get the two sets of underwear because we didn't have anything else. But then they had the Jewish community over there already. We stayed over there, we stayed in Czechoslovakia for maybe a month, and then I decided we can't stay here either and I went back with Regina to the American zone in Germany and I came to the D.P. camp in which was established at this time. We were one of almost the first ones over there and I worked in that office too. I worked for the United Nations Relief Organization. I worked for the Joint Distribution Committee. And the Joint Distribution made our wedding over there. We got married over there. The wedding was in Munich, took us to Munich. Then Regina got sick. Something was wrong and they took her to the hospital and they gave her some medicine which didn't agree with her and she developed some kind of a blood -- something was wrong with her blood and a fellow came in from the C.I.A, and American, by the name of Doctor Aaron Mayer, asked what can I do for you. She said I don't need anything, the only thing she says I know I have an uncle in the United States that lived in New York, but I don't know where he lives but I know his name was . So, what he did, Doctor Aaron Mayer, he put an ad <span class="page-break" number="13"></span> 6 Tape #2</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We got those papers from her uncle, and it took us almost a year before we could come over here, even with the papers being in order and everything else, but we moved from to because we found out one of the brothers was alive and he was in the American Army. He escaped during the war. He went to England, then he got on a ship and came to the United States and jumped ship. Then he joined the American Army and became a citizen and that's how he came back to Europe. Then when we found out he was in Regina says we might as well move to so we can be closer to her brother. We stayed over there until we came over to the United States. Let me tell you something about . When we came to , we were one of the first ones to come to the D.P. camp. There were <span class="page-break" number="13"></span> 7 we can do and what we cannot do. President Eisenhower was a big help, and he really did a lot for the D.P. camps, quite a lot.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Was it your sense that was well organized and well run and that <span class="page-break" number="14"></span> 8 That is impossible. This could not happen. Finally now, they tape them in order to have their stories what they went through and lot of them are already very old. One of them told me that Walsh was his name he said his father couldn't even come because he had a stroke. He wanted to come to the gathering that they had about the film, but he couldn't come to it any more. So, his son was over there representing him. Those other things that happened, not only the Jews, even the other nationals, the Gentile people that were over there, the Americans and the English, even when they told their stories nobody would believe them when they told them what was going on in those camps.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In the beginning when you were in and people from a lot of other countries, did you mix with them or did the Jews kind of stick with themselves?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: A lot of Ukrainians over there and we didn't feel very comfortable with them because they were in charge with our camps, of our labor camps and they all had to leave in order for us to get over there. We couldn't stay with them together. Because people don't realize but they were our enemies not our friends. They used to say they were in camps in Germany, but we know what kind of camps they went into.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, how did all of that work out?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It worked that they had to ship them somewhere else. They had a home to go back to but they didn't want to go home. They were afraid to go home because they were collaborators with the Germans.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But initially at , they put you all together?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: What else can you tell me about . Did people work there? Did you <span class="page-break" number="15"></span> 9</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did people work at the D.P camps? I know you did.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, a lot of them worked too. They worked for the Joint Distribution Committee but as far as other jobs like working in trades or something, but the came in and the put up some schools to teach the people <span class="page-break" number="16"></span> 0 already deny it. You have a lot of revisionists that say that the Holocaust did not happen.</p><p>So, we feel, because we never talked about those things, but we feel that now that we have to talk about them in order to make people and especially the kids that those are the things that really happened. For instance last year I and Regina went with a group of kids, Jewish kids from all over the world. We went on the March of . We went to Poland. We took them to the concentration camps. Then we went to Israel. It's amazing what that did to the kids. At least they know they talked to some of them that were really there and showed them the places and what was going on in those concentration camps.</p><p>Because just talking to somebody about it, it doesn't bring out as much as you can really go to the place and witness and see what has been going on over there. A lot of those kids, that knew very little about Judaism have changed quite a lot.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Over the last 50 years, I'm sure there are certain images that come back to you a lot. Can you talk about any of them?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Those images come back to me all the time. There's plenty of nights that I talk to people about them. I usually don't talk about those things during the day, and I told I have to be busy in order to forget those things, but I wake up in the middle of the night still seeing all those monstrosities and everything else. I can't talk about them a lot of times, but I can see them and I feel them. I wake up in a sweat and it's very hard for me to get back to sleep. If we get together with our friends that went through, that's all we talk about. We can't talk about anything else. Thank God we have three children. We have seven grandchildren and I ask my kids, I said when you were younger when they were very little and they saw my number when they were two years, two and half, they asked me what is that number I used to tell them some bad people did it to me. But later on they never asked us any questions because they realized they heard us talk to our friends all the time, and they knew that something very bad happened to us during that time. Even now, they tell us that's why we didn't want to ask you about it. We knew what you went through but we didn't want to ask you about it. Even now, after 50 years, it's very, very hard to talk about it. But then we figured we have to establish a new life when we came over here. We worked very hard. I worked seven days a week, 20 hours, as many hours as it took in order to build up what I did, and thank God it's a wonderful country. I wouldn't like to live anywhere else, and I appreciate everything that the United States did for me. And I'm paying taxes every year too, and I don't mind. They've been very good to me here and since I came to the United States, I've worked mostly for the government. I did a lot of work -- I have clearance with the F.B.I., with the C.I.A., and I never forget when I came over to this country and I worked at and I worked at the</p><p> and in the middle of the day, one of the soldiers came over and took me up to and I got very scared. I thought I was in Germany again. They were going to send me away somewhere else, and I found out the reason I was taken off of the job was because I didn't have my citizenship papers. I was not a citizen and it was a job in those days was very secret and that I can't work over there <span class="page-break" number="17"></span> 1 in the White House when Nixon was making the tapes. We worked around the clock for 24 hours in order to get the air conditioning and ventilation in the basement. I'm thankful for everything. I have a very nice family and I hope that we stay well that I can do more what I want to do to help other people which is very, very important.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Is there anything else you want to add about those years?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't want to go through the monstrosities to tell you what's going on too much. I get very, you know, I'm but if you have any special questions you want to ask me that you want me to say about I'll be glad to answer.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You have to appreciate that someone, sometime might look at this tape and say monstrosities, maybe they're going to want to know more what that means?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The only thing I can say that not all people are bad. They are some good people with the bad ones too. Even there were in concentration camps, and I worked with a German that was running the factory. It's true that he lost three sons in the war and he didn't like Hitler too much either, but he always every day, he knew what was going on, brought something in, like an apple sometime, a little piece of bread, but he told me don't take it until I go out from here, because if they catch me I'll be in trouble, and he put it away at a certain place and then I left, before I left I used to go out and get it and I used to come home, you know, back to the barracks, I used to share it with my friends. The fellow when were in the fellow that was in charge of our barrack was a German by the name of Walter, and I found out that he killed his parents and they put him in jail and then they put him in charge of us. I also found out later that it was a homosexual which I didn't even know what a homosexual really was when I was in camp in those days, but he also had a girlfriend in the factory and he spoke German and she spoke only Polish and when he found out he took me to carry the letters from the factory back to camp from him to her because he couldn't go out from camp. We went to work, but he stayed over the whole day and took care of it, so usually when I came home at night he had this special soup for me which I shared with my friends and this means almost difference between life and death, this soup. And also, in the winter time it was very cold over there, but because we worked in the train factory an the trains were running on coal, so we made up that each man that came back took a little piece of coal and put it in his pocket, very little piece, maybe a centimeter and half by centimeter and half, and when we came back to the barracks, we had a little bellie stove, a little iron stove and the fellow that was running, that Walter, the German that was running the camp didn't mind and everybody threw the little piece of coal in that little stove and we had it a little bit warmer at night. We were one of the lucky ones maybe. You had to help yourself a little.</p><p>You couldn't take too much of that coal back, but a little piece, nobody noticed when you went through the gate and coming in with it and that's how we kept warm at night in the camp. I imagine that we're also lucky that they took us instead of <span class="page-break" number="18"></span> 2 survived there because usually they came in they picked them to do certain jobs, to take the clothes away when we came off they took the clothes away from the people then they sorted the clothes, then they took the people, you know. If you were picked to do a job you couldn't help it. You took the people from the gas chambers and put them in the crematoriums and it was people like us. You know, they picked them out and that's what you did. So, they use you as long as you could do it and if you got tired of doing it, they put you in the crematorium and picked somebody else to do it. So, it wasn't something like just -- in the camp that I was in they used to hang people every Sunday and everybody that did something bad, they used to hang them on Sunday. They used to pick up people from the rolls after they stayed on that appeal in the morning and we used to hang them. They didn't do it themselves. Used to go out and put the thing on their neck, but you couldn't help it. Luckily I wasn't picked, but maybe if I would be picked I would have to do the same thing. It was one of those things. Another thing in those camps, in Auschwitz Sunday when we didn't go to work even if it was cold, we had to stay outside the hole day. They wouldn't let us go into the barracks and sit inside because we were going to make it dirty. The floors are going to be dirty. We had to make our bed as much as we could every morning and then you were sick you were afraid to go to the infirmary because you knew what was going to happen to you. I'll never forget I cut myself once in my arm here, right here, and I was afraid to go, and I don't know what I did but I put a piece of rope on one side and on the other side and it just healed up and I used to go to work, and I used to be sick. I used to get a sore throat and a fever. I used to go to work. I never stayed in the barracks. I figured if I stay I know what's going to happen to me, so this way I just went through and when we went home, walking, we used to hold tight, used to hold each other in to the ends and my friends if I couldn't go my friends were dragging me in until we got in there. I used to take my friends until we got back to camp, and that's how I survived. We helped each other. If not we wouldn't be here. Even when I escaped, I'll never forget I can't even remember they said I was in the woods it was so bad, but we survived somehow. It's amazing what a human being can stand when it happens. There was no place for us to escape because there was no body that helped a Jew on the outside. Maybe in another country. Maybe in Holland or Belgium or France but not in Poland because most of the crematoriums were built in Poland. Even from the countries, they brought them into Poland, like Birkenau, Auschwitz, Maidonek. Maidonek, is a camp that still the Germans didn't have time to destroy it and it's still, they can start up a ration over there in two days if they had to. The crematoriums and everything is over there. That's why I took the march of the living kids who went to Maidonek. It's not only the Jews that got killed during the war. A lot of the Russian prisoners. When I was in there was a camp of Russian <span class="page-break" number="18"></span> 3 I have an American that was in the camp and I worked with him after <span class="page-break" number="18"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
