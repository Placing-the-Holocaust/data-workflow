<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see. Okay. [break] So, we've -- earlier we spoke about your life, about the complications that came with being from a mixed marriage. About the extraordinary strength, as well as youth, that your parents had, to endure everything. I'd like to ask you now, is there something you would want your grandchildren to know, and other people's grandchildren to know, about that time that you lived through.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I would like them to know that they would never go through their life, what we went through. And sh-should respect people for their beliefs, and what they are.</p><p>They [indecipherable] everybody for that. Because life is hard enough without all the complication.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now the -- you know, you mentioned through your story, something that I find very unique, which -- unique in the degree of loyalty that your parents had one -- to one another, when all the pressures were on them, particularly on your mother, to renounce your father. What would you want of the values that they passed onto you, that your children and grandchildren would also know about?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: First of all, I was very against mixed marriages. <span class="page-break" number="130"></span> ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion Interview with Edith Weinstein ms May 18, 2015</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You were?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yeah. It's very hard, not on the two people who got married, it's for the children. They don't belong. Nobody wants to accept responsibility for them. But now we live in a new world, and I hope it never gonna happen again, because everybody's bleeding the same way.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, that's true. That's true. Is there something in your story, and in your life, that you would like to share, that you forgot to tell us about?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I'm not even think of it, what I can te --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: That you think is important for us to know.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: [know it, but I would -- I can't think of it. I don't know. It's -- I think my childhood, I --I could think it's -- was hard, but still, I like to remember it, because we all had each other, and we worked for the common goal, and we were very loyal to each other, what it's very important. And especially, I give my mother the greatest respect, because she did not have to suffer like anybody, because she had a choice. But she did it, and my father and mother, happy. And she stayed a widow for 42 years. That's how loyal she was to her father, even she was not accepted from the beginning, by her in-laws. And I admire that so much. I admire that loyalty, and I think we have it as such, most of our children, or her children, have all that loyalty. <span class="page-break" number="131"></span> ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion Interview with Edith Weinstein ms May 18, 2015</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So that's something that she modeled for them, and showed for them, and they took as a--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>

Now, my brother is married over 50 years. My other brother just lost his wife, and my other brother married very late, he has a young wife. His children is only as old as my children. But that's my youngest brother, so we all have that value that marriage is very important, and loyalty that we learned from my mother, and my father.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We -- we didn't talk as much, but we just say it is so very hard, how you grow up in that, and suddenly you live this way.
