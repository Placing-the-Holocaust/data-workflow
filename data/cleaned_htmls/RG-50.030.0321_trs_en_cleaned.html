<body><dialogue class=""><p>HENRY VAN DEN BOOGARD April 10, 1995</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I'd like you to start by telling me your name, your date of birth, and your city of birth?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My name is Father Henry Van Den Boogard and I was born in Holland in in <span class="page-break" number="0"></span> time they were hiding there, the little boy was born, and it was very dangerous. But what happened to them later, their name was , and I never found out if they survived the war or not. When I was ordained in 1942, it was the last Sunday of July then the first Sunday of August was August 2. I said my first mass in Holland and there was a big celebration in town. It was a town of about in those days about 10,000, now there's 20,000 people, but there was a big celebration, and a parade and everything. In the afternoon there was a reception, and the mayor came also to the reception and his name was John</p><p> , and he was very anti-Nazi, anti-German, and he was very sleepy when he came to the reception. He said you have to excuse me because the whole night I had to visit Jewish families. I didn't know there were so many Jews in our home town, but he had to tell them that they had to go into hiding because that same night they would be arrested. And there was a policeman and he was in favor of the Nazis. He fought always with the mayor because they had different opinions and the mayor was very anti-Nazi so at the end of the war he had to go into hiding himself. That is why I knew there were quite a few Jews in my hometown. Then I didn't do anything until I had a brother-in-law, his father was born in Germany. He just got married, then, in those days, and his father was born in Germany, so the Nazis made all the decedents who were born in Germany, they made them German so they could serve in the military service. But my brother-in-law didn't want. He was the husband of my sister who lives here with me now and my brother-in-law, his name was Robert . He died already about 20 years ago. He asked me if I could help him.</p><p>So, I had to find out where he could go into hiding. I found out then who the leader of the Resistance was in that area. There was , in Rosenthau and he said oh he can stay here. And , would like to mention him because he did a lot for the Jews. He's not living anymore but in those days everything was so secret he didn't tell me that he had a Jewish family in his house too hiding. He was working with a priest who was a trappist before. He was still a trappist but they were kicked out of the monastery by the Nazis. Then he had to find a place so he became a chaplain in a very large nun's convent in Rosenthau. But he was only a name chaplain. What he did was working for people who wanted to go into hiding especially Jews. He did a lot. He was smuggling weapons and things like that and finding hiding places to keep those Jews alive. But he was not very prudent and we thought some day he will be arrested and it happened. He was arrested. His name was . I didn't name his full name, I knew only as Fonse, his nickname, but not his last name. I found it out later. He went to a concentration camp in 5 close to my hometown, but he was last seen in the , in the police office when he was arrested. But we never heard of him later. We didn't know what happened to him. Now, when the war was over, the leader of this Resistance in , he became the leader of this concentration camp where no Jews were anymore but were just the Nazi prisoners. I was then assistant in the North, but I went to see him in the South and I visited him, I said, did you ever find out what happened to Fonse, I said don't know, and he said I don't know either, but I know of a famous architect and he knows of somebody in the</p><p> who works there and he was hiding with priests somewhere in the west of . So, I got the address of the architect and this architect was making a <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> . It was closed. So, I went there by car, that was given to me by the leader of</p><p> the concentration camp. He's a soldier, so when I saw him, it was lunch time, there was nobody anymore in the office, only one gentleman and he knew me. I said how do you know me. He said do you not know me anymore? You helped me go into hiding. I said when was that? I said I have no hair I was a prisoner in and they cut my hair I was bald headed and he had a prison suit on and I was going to be executed in the neighborhood of Rosenthau and they brought me there with other prisoners who were going to be executed too but then we were attacked by the English planes and we all left the cars and could go into hiding in the corn field. It was not corn, it was wheat. We could crawl through the weeds the fields to the neighbor town where I was living. It was during the hours that there was a curfew at night, so in the morning I had to go Rosenthau to bring some pictures of Jews who had to have false identification cards and there was a teacher in town who took those pictures. He was an amature. He took those pictures, developed them at night, and early in the morning as soon as the hours were over of the curfew, then I was going to pick them up and bring them to Rosenthau to have my brother-in-law who was hiding he had to make those i.d. cards. So, when I went through the town I saw in a hallway of a house I saw somebody standing in the suit of the prisoner's bald headed and he called me. He said can you find me a place where I can stay. I brought him then to a place where the brother of Doctor DeBeer, he was a physician, and his brother was a priest, he was in hiding too. I brought him there. So, as soon as I told me who he was, I thought this is not the one who was hiding with Fonse so I was just as far as I was in the beginning. I did find out. Later on I came to Paris and I wanted to know so badly where Fonse was if he was still living or not so Thad on radio his name if somebody knew about him, his whereabouts to let me know. So, I got a letter from the abbot of the monastery, he said as soon as you know let us know. We want to know what happened to him, too. I got a letter from his relative in Hague, they wanted to know also where Fonse was, if he was still living. But then I got a letter from a doctor in , where the concentration camp was. He said I saw when he was dead, I had to make a certificate that he was dead. He was killed on that day. It was two weeks after he was arrested. Now there is some monument for Fonse in that nun convent and he's on the list of the ones who were killed in . But, now we don't know much about him, but I wanted to emphasize more what , the leader of the Resistance. And Fonse , this priest what they did for the Jews because it was never recognized. Nobody knew and nobody knew the names. They never gave the names, but I know, because I worked with them that they were hiding Jews making false papers for them, i.d. cards and trying to keep them alive by finding food so I would like to emphases that now that I have the opportunity to make it known what they did during the war. So, that is what I usually did. I didn't do much myself, only I did on my bike brought i.d. cards to people who were hiding. Once I was asked by to bring a few <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> Then it's more dangerous for me. So, I thought, the Lord will help me. So, I went through it and when they stopped me, what's in that box and then I got an idea. I said I don't know what's going on today but the third time I have to open that books everybody wants to know what's in that box. Then he said okay go ahead, so I was shaking very much but I saved my life. That's what I did, but it got a little bit too dangerous for me there in the South. They found out what I did, so I was advised to go into hiding.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay, I just want to ask you a little bit more about this period in the South. I'm going to back track a bit. When the Nazis came into Holland, what happened? What was the reaction?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>What was going on?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was in the seminary and it was before I was ordained and I remember from a window in the seminary we were watching when they marched into the town, and we were extremely mad because they invaded our country and we tried to defend it with only a few days that our soldiers could defend our country, but then they just overthrew us. There was no end to it.</p><p>We were extremely mad, and then they were going to throw bombs, that was before. The older seminarians had to go into the basement and we spent their nights and days in the basement, but what was going on in other towns we didn't know too well. I only went at night, early before the other seminarians and the teachers they got up. I went already to Rosenthau on the bike after the curfew hours to bring pictures and books to the people who were hiding to keep them busy and to have their false i.d. cards made. It was all I knew about the Resistance. I didn't know what was going on in other towns.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did you know about this man who was leader of the Resistance?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: There was a seminarian and he worked in the underground too. , was his <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> and Father Fonse. Father Fonse I saw at house very <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> didn't know which religion they had. I didn't know anything about them. Later on, Jews came. They all got that address from Father , and then I got a couple of Jews and then I got another couple and then more and more and I never knew if they were Jewish or not, and I found places for them, and there was a baker. There was an organization also, an underground organization in that town and there was a Protestant Minister and he belonged to that organization and he could get the rations, the coupons, and I got from him enough coupons all the time for all the people in hiding. But one day he asked me to give him a list of all the people who were hiding and where they were. I said I'm not going to do that because we are not going to give any names and I don't know their names. Then we have to stop to get you coupons. I said then I'll have to find another way. So, I found then a group in , that was another town, and I got in contact with the underground there <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> Tape #2</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: When I was there up north, they asked me many times from the Holocaust, can you give any names. How people did you help? I said I didn't know. I didn't know who was a Jew or who was not a Jew, but I knew there were many Jews among them, and there were a few who got a little bit homesick, and they wanted to go close to Amsterdam where they came from. Then I there was no way to travel by train. There was no train going any more, no bus. No cars, there were no cars, only by bike. Then I found I could borrow a few bikes, and then they had little boys who were strong enough for the ride from . We went to I don't remember, with the underground. In there was a river, and it was difficult to cross that river because there was so much control from the Nazis. So, I could bring him to with the bike and then those people who were hiding, those adults, riding the bike and on the back seat was a little boy but the boy was strong enough to ride back to the home town. That was a whole day riding. I think it was. I don't know how far it was. I went with six people and it was a distance of a few hundred yards between me and the next one and the next one, and I said, I was in front, when I put my hand on the lantern, that means there is danger. See that you find a hiding place. Don't continue. I'll find you later, but we didn't need it. So, I did it several times to bring people back to &gt; but had to cross the river. I gave there in the hands of the underground and there was a lot of people who worked for the Nazis, the , and they got some tickets to cross the river in the morning and in the evening, and the underground they got hold of some of those tickets and they could give it us. So, those people were and got a ticket too and walked over the bridge with those people to the other side and then they had to find their way. But they never found out who they were in the town there was a pastor from</p><p> , and I became quite popular there because people were saying since Father is</p><p> here, something is done for the people that went into hiding. It was known. I didn't tell people, but they found out anyhow. Then the pastor got a little bit jealous. He said before Father came here nothing was done, so much is done for the people that went into hiding.</p><p>That is why I didn't tell the pastor anything, but later on I had no more places to hide, no more families, then I asked the pastor can I use the parish hall. The parish hall was not used for anything. He first said no and I got a little bit upset about it, and later he came to me and said it's all right, you can use the parish hall. So, I found straw to sleep on and pots and pans and everything and then I had so many people because we are close to the German border, it was at the end of the war and many people could come through -- it was a march between our countries and we were about a mile from the German border, and once I remember they told me that there were a few people they called , because there was a <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> clothing and so on and some food and then I'll find a place for you to hide here. What the two of them were I don't know, but the other one he was a catholic. His name was Chris</p><p> , and then there was the one I knew from the seminary. What else can I tell you? I had many kids in different places and I didn't know their names and I didn't know their religion but they had to go to school. Then I found out there were quite a few Jewish kids among them, too. There was one catholic boy and he heard two years ago when I was celebrating my golden anniversary in my hometown, he heard about, and he was one of those kids and he was now a rich guy close to Amsterdam. He was an exporter of tulip bulbs to foreign countries, and he came to the reception. Now, last year or this year he came to visit me, but I didn't like him very much because he was very egotistic and never paid anything. He was here for about six weeks. I went with him to Virginia to cut the time a little bit. I had to pay everything and he was not satisfied with the food that my sister made. He asked for other food, so I couldn't stand him any more. I was glad when the six weeks were over, but that was one of the boys. That's the only that I knew the name from. All the other ones I never knew the name. His name was Chris . <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> and they all would be arrested, so I tried to forget about it, but I never could forget it. A few ladies later a policeman from the town came directly and told me that it was too much known that I did something for people who were hiding and I had to go into hiding myself.</p><p>So, I went to a couple a brother and a sister. They were single, and they were already older and he was a furniture maker, and I could go into hiding there, but it was not far from the rectory. Through the window, my bedroom window I could see the rectory. I watched at night all night if I could see Germans coming to the rectory to pick me up, but I didn't see anybody, and after a week nobody came so I started again to live in the rectory. That's about all I can remember from the time I was there in the northern part. Everything was the same all the time. Helping Jews, helping other people who were hiding. People who were picked up a lot of them who had to work in factories in Germany who came through the march. I had to find places. I had to find food for them and to keep them alive. It was difficult because those people didn't get rations, and those people who got rations got very little too, so I had to go to that was another town where many farmers, and I went through <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> 0 too to my golden wedding anniversary to the reception. There were about 16 people from that Parish and they had to come all the way from the north. They had to drive for hours to get there and four hours to go back. I don't remember too much about those days in the north.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Let me ask you, when you were in the north, how long were you up there in</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> 2 <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> 1 rifle and the people were shouting at them and so on. Also, the girls who dated German soldiers their hair was cut off completely. They were bald headed, and so I had some books with a lot of pictures but I lost them all in Chile, pictures about the concentration camps and so on. During the war I didn't know too well what happened to the Jews. I knew that that they were put in concentration camps, but I didn't know that they were killed. I heard it after the war.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When you were going around this area looking for food, going to farmers, did they know why?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, I had to tell them, but I didn't tell them for Jews because that was too dangerous. When they would know that you were helping Jews they would put you in a concentration camp and kill you, but I said certain people a lot of them were picked up on the street and in the churches to work in factories in Germany. | acted like it was all for them. The Hollands were very helpful when a priest came there to ask for food, sometimes they got one potato.</p><p>Sometimes I got a little piece of bacon and so on, but it all added up. But I didn't want to bring it to the rectory because the pastor had two sisters living there that took care of him but they want to have as much as possible for themselves, so I went first to Sister Nista across the street, that nurse, and I stored them there. At once she helped people who went into hiding, Jews or no Jews, and there was a guy who came there and he was hiding there in her place and the pastor and the people didn't know if he was a traitor or not. So, some from the underground came there and interrogated him and they acted like they were Nazis and he said I'm Nazi too, and he showed them the papers. Then finally he said we are not Nazis, we are from the underground too, and then he showed papers that he was from the underground, so they didn't know, but they let him smoke a cigarette and took him outside and killed him with a hammer, and they buried him in the peat and that happened before I came there. I knew exactly where he was buried and the companies were digging for that peat, they were getting close to that grave and I was afraid that they would find him, so I told him they had to go to another place. I don't know how I told them, but they didn't dig there further, so they didn't find the body. I don't know what happened with that body later either because when the war was over, I had a lot of people in the parish house.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How many?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Sixty, I think, to eighty, and then they left and then the new ones came in and I told one of the guys to put all the names down, but they never got the paper with all the names. It was difficult to keep them alive to find food. When the war was over we just said, I told the pastor I think we are liberated. They didn't come to us. They forgot us. They went to towns, the Allied and I think ring the bell and we are liberated too and then the pastor and I went on the bicycle over the border there was no control any more but there were some Canadians on the other side in German and I didn't remember much English but I tried to talk to them a little bit and they asked me for an i.d. card. They didn't know if I was safe or not, but we went to the pastor to get some mass wine and candles. In Germany they had everything planned here we didn't have anything. That's what happened after the war. Then there was a <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> 2 band but here you have high schools with band, but there they are adults and they don't have uniforms. They just get together and form a band, and they came to bring a serenade to the Jews who were hiding in the Parish hall. I remember that they standing there in their sloppy clothes. Their overalls are dirty. They are standing there all in line, but soon when I found out that it was a soldier from the Allies, he was a Hollander, and he was also at my reception a few years ago. I still have pictures of him here and I could just go with him to my home town, then the Pastor who was a little bit jealous of me because I was getting too popular he got a letter that I was appointed for Chile and he arranged right away for my farewell party.</p><p>When I came back there was a farewell party and I didn't know where all those people who went into hiding where they went. They didn't know my name either, so I don't know, I went to the south and had a vacation and prepared to go to South America. So, I don't know what happened later. Only one I found and he had tuberculosis and he was in one of the provinces laying in bed. I went to see him. I think he got t.b. in the concentration camp. I don't know what happened to him either. I don't know his name. I can't remember. I did remember it because I went to see him and it was far away from the town where I was assistant. It was between him and my parents in .</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: These people who were hiding there, did they hide for a few months and then move on?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Some did. Some did until the end of the war. Some got homesick and it was difficult for the Jews because they were told they couldn't go out. They were locked up day and night for a long time, and I remember that once, one of the assistants came and he said this Jewish family and they can't stand it any more and they get out at night and walked around and that is so dangerous they bring the people where they are hiding in danger too, and we have to kill them. But I didn't want to have them killed, so there was one of the Resistance to save those people where they were hiding. So, I went to those Jews and told them to be careful and said you bring those people who are helping you into danger. I can't understand why you are getting so restless. If you stay day in night in that hiding place you ought to have some friends once in a while. That was the end of it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were some of them trying to go through Holland and go south through France and Spain?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. That was in the beginning when I was working in the south. Fonse he brought many over the border and , too. There I knew that many people went into <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> 3 Tape #3</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell me a little bit more about what you actually did. I mean you went to look for food. You went to the local farms. What other kinds of responsibilities did you take on and also did you sort of invent what you had to do or were you working with other people?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I did all on my own. I worked a lot with that nurse across the street. She was a retired nurse, Nista, and I remember her name very well, but I don't remember the name of that nurse that came with all those kids. She was staying with the nurse, Nista. That's what I remember. I did it all on my own. I didn't want to tell anybody. I didn't even want to know the pastor or his sisters or the girl who worked there. The girl who worked there remembers still many things that I was a signet because she was about 17 years old at that time, I think, she came here last year. You have seen her I think. , she was here for a vacation for <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> 4 too valuable to give big pieces to people separately and a lot of bread from Baker Hartman.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you have to find clothing?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I went to the south one time and got a whole truckload of clothing and bed in the south from my home town. There was a hospital in Tillburg and one of my relatives was the head nurse there and they got all new beds and I got about 50 beds and it was too much to bring them -- [had to rent a truck to bring them. Then I said to the pastor you divide it because I couldn't keep a secret that I had a truck coming, and then he acted like he was giving it all to the people. Sometimes the people asked me they came to the door and said, can I talk to the pastor, okay, but they didn't want to tell me that they want to get some of the clothes that I got to the parish, but the pastor acted like it was all from him because he said nobody's supposed to know it, but he was not very cooperative.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, he took some of this for his own purposes?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes, food more, and clothing, they gave some clothing to that girl that was working there,</p><p> . [remember they selected -- I had an uncle who had a factory in Tillburg. He <span class="page-break" number="11"></span> 5</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, they were too afraid, not very much. Not very much, I got in touch with only one policeman, and I remember that when I told those people hiding in the parish hall that there was one guy and the other guy, former prisoners, they said he was helping the Nazis and they called it a , the one who tortured people to get secrets out of him, but <span class="page-break" number="12"></span> 6 worked among the people in the Resistance. There were several priests and I asked them about it too, and we couldn't. We didn't have any rabbis.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What do you think when you were working, doing all of this, was your biggest difficulty?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think to keep everything secret. Not to talk about it at the table with the pastor and his sisters what I was doing. But they knew that I was working, helping people when they were in hiding, but they didn't know exactly what I did and who I was helping, where they were. I had to keep my mouth shut. This is sometimes difficult when you get along with those people every day. Oh, I fooled them a lot. I tell a joke, this Baker Hartman, the pastor and his sisters had a little dog, and the dog died and then they got another dog the same size and the same kind. But the dog was not house broken and when you came in the rectory there was a stairway and then the landing and every morning on the landing there was some dog droppings, so I asked the bakers I said can you make some droppings from bread, dog droppings, they look dog droppings like bread. He said, oh yeah I can do that. He enjoyed it I thought I want to fool the pastor and his sisters so I put it there on the landing and then that girl that came here for vacation , she came down and we were going from the <span class="page-break" number="13"></span> 7 doing and he let me do it and he didn't bother too much. He didn't ask too much either.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, when you were getting food coupons for example, from these other organizations, I'm curious about systems, how you knew about each other, how many organizations there were?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I knew only very few of the organization in the place where I was working. I knew them through a Protestant minister and he got the rations, and I knew also especially in the south when they were preparing theft to steal those coupons which were stolen, taken away from the Hollanders and they were stolen by people from the resistance and they gave them to us and we could give them to people who were hiding. That helped a lot.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did you know these other organizations? Were you coordinated?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't know. The guy in , a guy I got to know through the pastor and also in</p><p> the pastor of was arrested too. We never knew what happened to him if he was killed, but there were two priests who took care of the parish and they knew who was the leader there in . [went to him and I told him that they want from me a list of all the people who were hiding and where they were hiding and I don't want to give them, and they said we will take care of them. Then I got coupons from them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Early on, a few years before this, didn't the catholic church in Holland really come out and protest against the Nazis?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: More or less after Cardinal DeYoung had a letter read in all the churches.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When was this?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was, I think, "42 and at that time all the priests were in favor of helping Jews, but not all. I remember in when we brought some people there to go give in hands of the organization there to cross the river, then I had to stay over night in . [had an address from the pastor where I could stay but the next morning I wanted to say mass and he told me to go to that pastor. He said no the other one. There were two catholic priests, but I did remember which one was right and which one not, so I went to the pastor and I said I have to bring some people who are hiding. Oh, you are one of those, he said, I said the priest</p><p> , do you want to be arrested, too? I said who pays for the wine and the <span class="page-break" number="14"></span> 8 the Nazis then they had another letter to read at the next mass. That was very dangerous too, because there many times they were asking us in the church, the Nazis came into the church and arrest all the men in the church and brought them to the railroad station and the cattle cars, they were sent to Germany. And they had to stand there so close to each other and when they had to go to the bathroom they had only a bottle to pass from one to another and they had to pour it out. That was difficult. The Jews the same way. They were arrested by large groups.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you think that the Dutch Nazis were more tolerant of priests who did not support them?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You were in the same boat as every one else"?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. They were very anti-religion. Against the catholics, they were more or less the scum of the town. They were not the well education people, the Dutch Nazis.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you think that the clergy was very instrumental in terms of the underground efforts in Holland?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: As far as I know yes, but I don't have much experience of other parishes because we kept everything so secret. We didn't talk to each other about when we were helping people.</p><p>Sometimes we found out but many times we didn't even know, but we could, if we had to tell something we could trust them. Many priests were arrested. Many priests were sent to concentration camps. You heard about the priest who took the place of one who was going to be killed and he will be canonized was his name. He was a polish priest. I remember also that there was a , he was arrested too and killed and his <span class="page-break" number="15"></span> 9</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not that I know of. Before we had very little contact with protestants but during the war we were fighting the common enemy, then we got together and I got to know many Protestant ministers and we worked together and they tried to help and during the war they were brought together, the clergy of the different denominations. In Europe you don't have so many denominations, not in those days, as you have here. You had the Dutch Reformed and the , translated is also a reformed, but it is two groups and they are very, <span class="page-break" number="16"></span> 0 favor of the Nazi and favor of Germany.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: People were taking big risks so some people weren't willing to do that. I'm sure there were informers?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: A few or so but you knew soon what they had done to other people and then like I talked about Father Fonse he was very imprudent. He was very hard working. He didn't do anything than hiding people, finding food and smuggling weapons and so on, but he talked very freely but he never told me any names. But I found out many things after the war. I have a niece in Holland, she married my nephew and I asked her, because from the Holocaust they were asking for me about details about Father Fonse and she investigated everything and she went everywhere. She went to Belgium and Holland and to meetings and so on, and see I have those papers some where and I looked for them and I can't find them.</p><p>They are , she did a lot, but she was not born during the war, she was born later, but she did a lot to find out about Father . <span class="page-break" number="17"></span> 1 Tape #4</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: All of these families who helped you hide people, helped you in your work, were they compensated?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't know if they were compensated after the war, but not during my time, and I didn't tell them that they were going to be compensated, no, nothing. They didn't ask for money. They did it to help people. In the south, my brother-in-law did a lot for the people who helped him to hide. He sent them gifts all the time and things like that after the liberation.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When you think of your work with the underground, your own work, what do you think it's greatest failures were, if any, any weaknesses?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think in my hometown I heard later that sometimes things were discovered, and there was a group working had a book laying and was edited the anniversary, 75th anniversary of the paper that my father founded and there I read a lot about what people did during the war in my hometown, but I didn't know it in those days, but I was not living there. I was living in the seminary, and I was ordained during the war, and during the war we could not go to the missions where I was going to appointed later for South America. I didn't know during the last years of the war where I would go, so I knew that I had to do something in Holland and by coincidence in touch with the underground and that is why I started to work for them, but after the war, so many people in Holland talked oh I was in the underground too. Everybody wanted everybody to know that they worked with the underground, but many people made up things. Then we didn't care about it anymore. We didn't want to talk too much about it.</p><p>For example, this lady, she's here in the United State, she wrote a book and she talked to many groups, , you heard of her I guess. They worked, they did very much <span class="page-break" number="18"></span> 2 didn't write her name but she wrote the Post Office Box 53 and I remember that I found out who that was, it was Helen O'Connor and she worked that I did work for the Jews during the wars. That is why they contacted me from Washington with the or something in Richmond. You know him, because you talked about him. I was in correspondence with him for a while, and through him I got that award.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was there a sense of adventure about this that you were really combating the Nazi?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. We were glad to do something about it, to fight the Nazis. We hated the Nazis so much and there is still a lot of hatred in Holland. They hate the Germans because of the war and that was so many years ago. And then they say we must forget it it is so long ago, but some people can't forget, especially the older people, but many young people there now today and that is why I'm glad to have the opportunity to tell something who don't believe in the Holocaust. They say it didn't happen. It's impossible.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What do you consider your greatest accomplishment during all of this?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was the contact I think with Father Fonse and and also what I did <span class="page-break" number="19"></span> 3 the name of the town, and the pastor -- he had no sense of humor and so on and I had to hide many things from him and he let me do things, but I don't know if he agreed on it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was it in your makeup that enabled you to do what you did? What prepared you, I mean you weren't prepared to go into the underground, but what drove you that didn't drive that pastor and some other people in your background?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think the pastor was too afraid.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What about you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was young. I was in the late twenties and I had everything. I didn't care. I was glad that I got that appointment is what made it a good covering to hiding there. I was proud of it, but I didn't tell anybody, but there was still a train going, but it took me a whole day, and I took my bike on the train, and after a while, it was a little bit before they called it</p><p> . It was the day that the Allies started to invade Europe. A few weeks before I went to the north and there if you can find out when it was, when the Allies landed in Europe, was it "44? Then I went to , and I stayed there until the war was over.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you need special skills to do what you were doing?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I thought everybody was doing it. Every priest. It was not so, but many priests were doing it.</p><p>We were in the opportunity to do something, they did it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It didn't require any special talents or personality?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, you had to be proud of doing something, to fight the Germans and to help the people who were in need. I have been all my life helping the poor. I went to South America and I was pastor there in the slum area. I worked first among the Indians, always among hungry people and then because there was so much trouble and poverty in South America that is why I came to the United States to find help for the poor. I went around here for many years to make appeals everywhere for the poor in South America. Then I became pastor in West Point, because I asked for a parish that I had to establish an office, and that's expensive, you have to rent a house. You have to pay the bills for lights and water and so on. I thought I better ask for a parish and have an assistant who would do that work and then we can continue the work for the poor. So, I asked for a parish and then I got first a parish in Portsmouth, Virginia, and the Bishop asked me you can make a choice. There was one parish, it was a black parish for Negroes and nobody wanted that. It had big debts. They let me take that. I had to make appeals to take the debt off. Then I started this discrimination to have a special parish for black people so I eliminated with the help of the bishop</p><p> the bishop was afraid that there would be some trouble but I asked the <span class="page-break" number="20"></span> 4 many white churches to go to their own, so we started first with the school to eliminate the school and that went through without any difficulty. Then we give them the parish and they had to pay off the debt. It was $250,000 and I paid it off by begging and so on, and then I got a parish in West Point. I talk to people sometimes when they ask me about the war, there was a guy --.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you integrated the parish?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, yes the other parish was integrated in Portsmouth but many left the church because they didn't want to. There was a guy in Virginia, he was a German, his name was Kyle Rudolph and he was a Nazi. I didn't know that, but I found out later, and he was very rich. He was a multimillionaire. He had a business in West Point. I can tell it now because he died two years ago, and he had a big business in a factory in West Point. He gave a lot of <span class="page-break" number="21"></span> 5</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Let me ask you a question about Holland right after liberation. I suspect there were a lot of adjustments after the war between people coming back and the people who were in hiding and the economy and everything.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was a little difficult for many people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: As a priest, what was your experience after the war?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Now, I don't have much experience because as soon as the war was over I went with this soldier in a pick up truck to . It took a whole day, and then I heard there I <span class="page-break" number="22"></span> 6</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you know them?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, because I was in the seminary. I didn't know much about my hometown. I was 12 or 13 when I went to the seminary and I went there only for vacation. I know only Mr.</p><p> and his family who were friends of my uncle, and I heard later that they went into hiding but the brother of my uncle and his sister and that their child was born there.</p><p>That was dangerous. But that is what I knew of my hometown. I was glad when the opening came for a pastor there in the north wanted to have an assistant because it didn't cost him anything. I would say mass and he could keep the money and I did work and he didn't have to pay for it. I didn't get any pay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you know when you were going north that you would continue your underground activities up there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was hoping that I would have an opportunity. I didn't know that I would have much more opportunities up north than I had in the south and up north I was more active directly. I found people and I had to keep them alive and I had found work and rations and food and money and places where they could stay. I enjoyed doing that. I was glad that I had that opportunity. In the south I worked more indirectly.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Anything else you want to say?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I'm empty I think. I told everything I remember. Maybe later on I think I could have told that, but at the moment. The last days I have tried, before you came, I knew that you were coming and I was glad to have the opportunity because so many young people don't believe in the Holocaust so they now have an opportunity to tell from my own experience that the Holocaust really existed and I was trying to remember things but it is so many years ago, and I'm bad at remembering the names. I remember couldn't remember the names in the south of</p><p> , who did so much for the Jews, but in the north I don't remember the <span class="page-break" number="23"></span> 7 reception to the south, and they had to drive several hours, maybe three hours to get there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you have anything else that you want to add?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I'm glad that I have this opportunity. But I was afraid that I would not remember enough.</p><p>I thought you came all the way from Washington and I have so little to tell. Do you think it is worthwhile?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Absolutely.</p></p></dialogue>
