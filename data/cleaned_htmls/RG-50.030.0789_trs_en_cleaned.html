<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you have German family, or German roots?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, because during the partition of Poland, that part of Poland was part of Prussia. So they were taken -- my grandparents were taken out of Poland to work, and my grandmother, my mother's parents were taken to Wiesbaden because my grandfather was a forester and they needed someone to work there. And both he and my grand -- my grandmother worked together. She took the administration under her hands, apparently that's where my mother got these mathematical -- 1-it -- influence. And my father took care of the -- the forestry, the cutting and the taking care of and so forth.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So they must have been bilingual.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Except that my grandfather, my maternal grandfather came from a family that, before the first World War, and I think it was at the middle of 19" century, they met -- my [indecipherable] through Turkey from Macedonia, and through the -- through the Carpathian mountains, came to Silesia, Shlunsk, and then -- and -- but my mo -- my grandmother was from Vierkapolska(ph), the up [indecipherable] Poland. So somehow they -- the families arranged it. He was dark, tall, my grandmother was blue eyed with very light blonde hair, and also tall.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>So-</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And on your father's side of the family, how did -- how did they end up, it was Garnisonkirchen(ph) --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Garnisonkirche, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: My grandfather was a cobbler.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And this was during the second World War?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: During the second World War, but during the first World War, he was in Garnisonkirche. He -- I don't know if he had interest, or he wanted to -- not to abandon the -- the -- the Polish immigrants that were taken to -- ba -- by the Prussians to Germany. He received a permission to teach them religion. They gave him only the first part of the Bible, the Old Testament, written in old Polish.</p><p>And for one hour on Sunday, he taught them the language, based on the Bible.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Isn't that interesting.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Ah, but also he worked in the underground, because he was working with the Polish workers, and they wanted to -- they were fighting for their own rights, in order to receive proper payment, and to be properly treated.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And this is in Garnisonkirche?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And this is in Garnisonkirche, but somehow I think somebody --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Informed on him?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- informed on him, and he was told that the best part would be if he left -- moved northwest, so he -- they went to north Dortmund. And from there on he promised himself that he will not return to Poland until Poland had a government.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> Interview with Jolanta Pawlikowski deg January 21, 2015 The government was established in 1922, so I believe that it took them almost two years to travel back.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Amazing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So clearly these are stories you must have heard growing up, from either your parents or your grandparents. Is that so?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh yes, Jaja(ph) would always t-tell me -- my father's father was also named Jusef(ph), and he would -- I loved stories. Apparently I was the only girl at that time. I had 11 cousins, including my brothers and my cousin and I was the only girl in that age. I had cousins, girls, but they were older, much older than I was, about 10 - 12 years old. But --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Well, that makes you quite special.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But I played with them, and when they were quarreling, they always said, okay, we have to have a general. Who is going to be the general? They pointed at me because I was the only girl. Would I quarrel with anybody?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. So, tell me a--a little bit about what happened to your family on September 1*", 1939, when Germany attacked Poland. You were a baby, so --</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So it was very quick, very quick.</p></p></dialogue>

So, he had the right to be called frontow(ph), right away.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And Mother tried to move closer to her mother, who lived in KoScian, which</p><p> was northwest of Poznan, and about 30 kilometers northwest of -- of Leszno. And  <span class="page-break" number="7"></span>  4 Interview with Jolanta Pawlikowski January 21, 2015 we were right -- few kilometers south. But she told me that she moved from town to town, zigzagging back and forth until she reached KoScian, because it was -- she was already pregnant with my brother Andrew. But she reached KoScian and lived with my mother and her ailing sister.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That is with your grandmother.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My father was caught in an ambush in -- in the forest behind -- around Oder, and that part of the regiment was practically annihilated. He was shot, was wounded. Those that were caught, which were about 10 -- he said about 10, maybe 15 people, but no more, cause some of them were very wounded, but were alive.</p><p>They took them, but he passed out apparently, and after two days, the German patrol was walking with dogs, and they stopped where he was lying, and the dogs know if somebody is gone or alive. And when they searched him they saw my father's army registration ca-card, a teacher's card, and that he was born in Germany, so they took him for one of his -- one of their own.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So he wasn't --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: They took him to Germany, they took him to a German hospital, and he, after a month, he came, he was well enough to speak, and he was interrogated.

<dialogue class=""><p><p>That camp was a camp that was dedicated or -- or protected by Himmel(ph). And it was a camp to show off how the Germans treat Polish officers.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So it was sort of like a show camp.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes. When there was no visitation, they would treat it like any other -- well, somebody -- a prisoner.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh my.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: When an American general was passing by, he opened -- my father was right on guard at that time by the -- by the gates. He opened, and he -- that's where my father learned some English, cause they wanted to show off that you could take English, you could take French, other -- to improve yourself, to show off that you -- that -- that the Germans were treating them properly.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And so that's why he could practice his English</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes, yes. And when he said, open the door, my father said, that was the first command of a different voice asking. I didn't know what to do. But he said open the door, and he showed them what to do. So the other fellow who was with him, they opened the gates, and he went through, all around. And said, you, where is your family, do you have a family? And -- and he said, my wife and children are in -- in Nordhorn, in northern part -- northeastern part of -- of Germany, right next to the Holland border. So he said, I'm going to Munich, hop in.

By the time they  <span class="page-break" number="10"></span>  4 Interview with Jolanta Pawlikowski January 21, 2015 got to Munich, my father was collapsing. He had a cut on his right leg, and he already had poison. So they kept him there. But my father had a letter from my mother, who could write to my dad in Murnau only three times a -- every year -- every quarter, she could. Every four months she could write a letter. And she wrote to him that we are in Nordhorn.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So that's in the northwestern part of Germany, if it's close to the Dutch border</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Border, na -- yes --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- northwestern part of Germany, right. Right.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And he left him there because the -- because he -- my dad needed --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Medical attention.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- med-medical attention, and this was sometimes in beginning of May, and we didn't see him til a month and a half later, when he came to Lingen(ph).</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So for all intents and purposes, your father was -- survived the war, but he was out of the picture --  <span class="page-break" number="11"></span>  Interview with Jolanta Pawlikowski deg January 21, 2015</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- as far as your life was concerned.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You -- did you remember anything of him in your first years, or is the first time you remember seeing him, is that month and a half later, when he shows up?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I didn't -- I knew only my father from the photograph that was standing on -- on the the table, on the side table at home. And in-in-in the place where my grandmother lived, and when I saw him, as an almost seven year old child, I looked and I said, that is not my father. My father was a handsome man, with a bushy hair. This is a sick man, this is -- cause when I saw him in Lingen(ph) in 1945 in July, I saw a man bent over, grayish hair and -- and his face was grayish, it -- he looked like he just came out of a tomb. He could barely walk, he was so weak. So, it was at -- that's the first time I heard him, after all these -- after six years of not seeing him. Cause I was a year old when he left.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: When he was gone, and I did not see him before. But we, my mother and I, we stayed in -- in KoScian. It's through June of 1944.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><p>And so they -- so that they, many times -- my mother taught me that she would put her letter with their letter, in order to make certain that it gets there. So my father sa -- had some letters when he came in 1944, when he appeared, because he kept  <span class="page-break" number="13"></span>  Interview with Jolanta Pawlikowski " January 21, 2015 certain letters. But certain letters, I've noticed that it was only my dear, or my beloved, and everything was blacked out.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Only he would -- and [indecipherable] I'm kissing you [indecipherable].
