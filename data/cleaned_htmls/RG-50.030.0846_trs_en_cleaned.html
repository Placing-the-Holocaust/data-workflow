<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: She has two names. You know, the reason that she has Aviva, because it was after my father come from visit from Palestine. It was not yet Israel then, you know, it was Palestine. British -- British Palestine.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And what does Aviva mean? What is the -- the meaning of the name?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: What's -- pardon me?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What is the viva -- Aviva, what does it mean? What is the me --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, fre -- Aviva in Hebrew it means spring, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So it was very appropriate.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Appropriate, yes, and -- and she wa -- she wa -- also, there was city named Tel Aviv, it's still the same name, so altogether, makes sense.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah. What was the language that you spoke at home with your parents?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: At home? At home we had actually two languages. The parents spoke between themselves in Russian, and sometimes in Polish, but with us they all spoke Polish.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Always Polish, yeah?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Polish, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did anybody speak Yiddish at home?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Thanks God, no. I tell you why I say thanks God. <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> Interview with George Dynin deg October 21, 2015</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because Yiddish -- people that spoke Yiddish, they couldn't survive. You don't know why. You see, peop -- nobody will tell you this --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- but I can tell you. The reason is that Yiddish left very heavy accent, and very heavy kind of m-music type of thing, you know. And people that spoke Yiddish, they can't get rid of it. So, you know, as soon as they opened mouth, you know, they -- 1-i-in Polish, they knew that they are Jewish people, and it means that they couldn't -- they couldn't save themselves pretending to be Poles. So many thousands of people died because they spoke Yiddish. It's very unusual, but that's is true, I bi-- nobody tell you because they say that it is offensive. It's not offensive, it's just actually, this is how it is.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm. Did --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, go ahead.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Does that mean that most people who spoke Yiddish didn't speak Polish, or they spoke it with an accent?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, 90 percent, I would say, spoke Polish. Some, maybe in the small sh -- s-s -- shtetls, you -- like you know, the children, maybe they just spoke Yiddish only, but <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> Interview with George Dynin " October 21, 2015</p><p> most people spoke both Polish and Yiddish. The ones that just spoke Yiddish, you know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, yeah. So, were your parents more assimilated, in -- in that they spoke Polish and Russian, or --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Absolutely not.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They been -- we [indecipherable]. It's better -- my father, he preferred to have a kosher food.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But you know, from this you cannot -- you change the type of food, and nobody knows who you are, you know. But the language you cou -- you couldn't get rid of it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It's just -- it's -- yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It's an accent, or it's a--</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It's accent is kind of like a melody type of thing, Yiddish is. So that's -- many people died because of this, but see, I am the first one that's not afraid to tell about.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Tell me a little bit about your father and your mother --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Okay. <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with George Dynin deg October 21, 2015</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- starting with their names --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>

He died in a hospital in Vienna.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did that happen, that he died in a hospital in Vienna, and not in Poland?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because in Poland at that time, they didn't have this kind of medical help like in Vienna. Vienna was a center of -- of medicine in Europe at that time, you know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay. Tell me now, I'm a little bit unfamiliar, was L6dz, or L6dzZ, was that part of the Austro-Hungarian empire before independen --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Ledz -- Le6dz was a -- a -- n-no, it was not Austria. Austro and Hungary was a little south from Ledz, you know.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> Interview with George Dynin deg October 21, 2015</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But this was rather German, I would say.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh. So it was part of the Prussian empire?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I would say so, yes, generally.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I know there was also a lot of Russian influence too, you know. So it must be something to do with -- with Russian, but I think it was absolutely that there be many Germans living in Ledz.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Even before the wars?</p></p></dialogue>

And it was a little -- water well was a little higher than -- than the rest of the thing, so I--I somehow went out to the street and [indecipherable] and I tell them exactly -- say it <span class="page-break" number="170"></span> Interview with George Dynin ms October 21, 2015</p><p> was two days later, you know. And I tell them exactly, you know, what day exactly should run away. So know what they told me? They told me that everybody it -- is afraid to run away because there will be not -- nothing to eat, you know. But you know, this was something that they didn't trust me, who I am, because they did think about run away, you know. Because 18 of them run away, and I know exactly how many because the police, when -- the Belorussian police have been the ones that killed them, and they been complaining that 18 didn't show off, you know, that somebody must tell them -- tell them, you know. So they did run away, you know, 18 of them. And the Poles, you know, there was something else I say to Poles -- you know how?</p></p></dialogue>
