<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you have a memory of when the invasion occurred? Do you remember where you were at the time?</p></p></dialogue>

And there was a parish house here, and then next to it, exactly next to it, the same wall, there was a big hotel before the war, which was occupied by the German Gestapo and various German services in that town. So we had a wall, and when I was sitting with the wall, I could hear the German officers on the outside. And then that priest, you know, slowly -- I -- I -- I suppose he was in touch -- no, later on he was in touch with the various Jewish idi -- organization. But we had as many as 20 boys in that house, you see, and on the first floor was a sort of a big room with a theater and so on, where the boys could at least take some exercise. And then, on the top there were his office and so on. And the boys actually lived in that house, you see, for -- they could not go out, right? And -- and that's the reason why he got in touch with me, because we wanted to, you know, on Sunday -- on Saturdays and Sundays, well mostly on Sundays, I suppose, we gathered, you know, neighborhood boys and so on, right, and then the Jewish children joined them and so -- so they could get some exercise and fresh air.</p></p></dialogue>

So -- and -- but my function, what I actually did was simply to take them out with other friends.</p></p></dialogue>

Communication was rather poor in the sense -- because most of them had language problems, right, and actually the priest, after the -- after the -- I mean the liberation of the country, created si -- courses in -- in Hebrew for -- for the boys.

I see that as a -- a-a-as a hope, I mean the -- and recently I got to understand much better the universality of the Jewish faith, if | may use that word. I don't whether I -- I hope I do not offend you, be-because the thing is that the root of western culture, although it's called Judeo-Christian, wi -- ba -- th-the first root is the -- the col -- the vocation of Israel, for instance, that Shema and so on, for me it's an -- wi -- although I'm a -- a ca -- believer Catholic [indecipherable] believer, there is -- for me it's absolutely fundamental. And I see it -- I would not say that in a Jewish way, but for me I-I see the origin of my own Catholic faith here, right in that extraordinary history of Israel and so on.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Now, we underwent a cultural revolution, wi -- and now the values, the traditional values, which we call Judean-Christian values are now deconstructed and so on. And there there is a tremendous work to do. I'm not negative, and I think that in that -- what I call that cultural revolution, wi -- there is something which could be transformed into a positive [indecipherable] the values of the western culture a-are changed. The change has been very negative and so on, but it -- it's also, you see, very -- 1-it could be transformed into a positive -- and there I see if the Jewish -- if there could be a common formulation. Not that the Jews really should -- to express that basic fundamental reality, the universality of the Jewish message and so on. But that should not be done, you know, by grade, or I don't know, or books and so on. It should be done -- it should come bottom up, you see? And that could be done. That -- that -- that could be done, because I'm sure that, first of all that there would be a communion of -- of the jewi -- because I am -- been a teacher all my life, you see and I'm oriented towards the -- the younger generation, I feel more at ease with -- but if that effort could come bottom up, wi -- through friendship, you know, networking. Of course, there is an intellectual work which has to be done. And that means educational work. But the reality should be friendship, should be personal counters, and start, you know, very low profile, not, you know, those big reunions.
