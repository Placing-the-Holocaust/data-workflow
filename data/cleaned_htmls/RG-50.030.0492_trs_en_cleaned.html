<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I'm sorry?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What were your studies there, in Namur?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So i-it's something which could have led, you know, to many different choices, and so on.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you alone from your family? Is Namur far from the town that you grew up in?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No, it was close?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They all -- they studied there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Uh-huh. So you were not alone from your family when you were studying there, you --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I was alone in -- in that place, at the -- that college, but I'm not the first in the family to go to - - to college if that is -- is the meaning of your question.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: No, no, no. My question is, when the war brokes out -- broke out, were you alone, away from your family, studying --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I was alone --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- when I was there, and so on, but of course, d-during the war condition we had, the traveling was not restr -- I mean, it was restricted, and not taken for granted, the normal times, so --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Mm-hm. Can you tell us a little bit more about your childhood, about the town that you grew up in? You mentioned something about the sugar industry. In what way was your family involved? What we're trying to do is get a sense of the community and the values and the world that you grew up in, so whatever you could tell us about that child -- those childhood years --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, that childhood was extremely happy, you see, I -- I never went to grammar school because I was too good to be sent to, you know, that country school. We were living in the country, and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- well, I enjoyed -- I was very happy at the time, and just no -- we had no worries, and then came -- you see, the Great Depression, beca -- at that time, because a -- the family business was a sugar producing and also [indecipherable] owning lots of farms and so on and so we were very involved in the agricultural way. And then my grandfather was a very capable and creative businessman, but he did not train, you see, his children and so on and so they were a background also [indecipherable] and that sort of thing, because the economic situation in western Europe at that time was difficult, particularly in the area of agricultural production and so on.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm. And in the sugar business, is -- that was something your father himself was involved in?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, no, that's the family business --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I see.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- so he was the owner of one part, part general stockholder and so on, and -- and also manager, yes, yes, and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I see.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- so that was entirely private thing, and just a -- but the times were th -- because the prices were going up and down and then the harvests, you know, were long and difficult and so on.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I think there was a catastrophic year, I forgot when it was, 1935 or so.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And you mentioned before that when the war occurred --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- you were -- you see yourself as somebody who was totally unprepared --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Unprepared.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- fo-for what had happened fo -- afterwards.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And it happened very suddenly because, you know, the war was declared by France and England. I think it was on September -- on September first, Germany invaded Poland, right? And then there was a, I don't know, an ultimatum or something, and the war between Germany and England and France started on -- I think on September third, and then there was a period, you know, a long period of neutrality and suspense and so on, and then on --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: In Belgium?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- May the 10" --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: In Belgium, you s --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- [indecipherable] in Belgium, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And on May the 10", the German invaded Belgium and Holland if I am correct, and so on.</p><p>Then th-that --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Do you remember that?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- for me who was still a -- a teenager, was a child, it came very suddenly, because all -- in our y-younger years, you know, we heard stories about the atrocities and suffering during the first World War, which was still reasonably close at the time, so -- so we were frightened, but we didn't know what we feared.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you have a memory of when the invasion occurred? Do you remember where you were at the time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Sure, sure, sure.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can you tell us about that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, the -- I was already in Namur at the time, and then I think there was some bombing and so on, and then -- then we left for France and so on, so -- so there is a -- was a retreat -- I mean, a -- we left the house, and so on the -- and then the -- there were battle and so on, just -- but well, that's -- that is not so clear in my memory, just that -- I just remember vaguely.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How -- did you return to Namur at any time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes, yes, of course --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- we return, and then -- and then the -- I don't know, I -- I -- I think the studies were interrupted, but it was -- no, I -- and I -- and wa -- 1941 I was back -- back to Namur, and so on.</p><p>And then I -- I met that -- that priest, you know, who took care of those Jewish boys and so on.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can you tell me a little bit about how you met this priest, what his name was?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I-I have no recollection of how I met them, but i -- it's an entirely extraordinary story. If you want -- did you want me to go into what I know of his --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: What was his name? What were the circumstances --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: His name was Jose-Joseph -- you see, now I have a -- excuse me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It's okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I'm getting old. I never thought I would forget his name. [indecipherable]. Oh, that's ridiculous. It will come back.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's okay. It happens sometimes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes, it -- no, 1-it was an extraord -- a very sensitive, young priest --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- a parish priest, and then he was transferred someplace, seminary where he was teaching, and it was a very extraordinary, heroic kind of man, very sensitive, and at the same time he could  <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> </p><p> be -- violently could get fits of anger and so on, but not at all, you know, resentments, so on, just because at times he was -- I mean, he was oversensitive. And then he was -- you are -- now are going to the substance of my --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah, I'd like to find out more how -- how it is that you got involved in this activity.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That -- I have no memory of it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Why, I just got involved. I suppose I met him, or somebody told me about it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But the story is that there was a parish house in -- on a sort of [indecipherable] and so on, but that is very local, it's not to be compared to the setting of Washington, it was very simple. And there was a parish house here, and then next to it, exactly next to it, the same wall, there was a big hotel before the war, which was occupied by the German Gestapo and various German services in that town. So we had a wall, and when I was sitting with the wall, I could hear the German officers on the outside. And then that priest, you know, slowly -- I -- I -- I suppose he was in touch -- no, later on he was in touch with the various Jewish idi -- organization. But we had as many as 20 boys in that house, you see, and on the first floor was a sort of a big room with a theater and so on, where the boys could at least take some exercise. And then, on the top there were his office and so on. And the boys actually lived in that house, you see, for -- they could not go out, right? And -- and that's the reason why he got in touch with me, because we wanted to, you know, on Sunday -- on Saturdays and Sundays, well mostly on Sundays, I suppose, we gathered, you know, neighborhood boys and so on, right, and then the Jewish children joined them and so -- so they could get some exercise and fresh air.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, if I can understand this correctly, there was a house that belonged to the college --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: To the parish, or to the --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Uh-huh, to the parish in Namur.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I shou -- in Namur, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah. And the priest who lived in the house --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- it was -- it was --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: It was a parish house for certain functions, I suppose the parish functions.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And he was the one who started saving the children.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And were these -- how old was the range, the age range of the children who were</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh, the children, I could not say, I would say about seven -- the -- we -- as far as I recall, we have no small children and so on, they were all, you know, beginning teenagers and so on.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So they were -- uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And no more than 12, I would say.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And what was --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: But then of course, they change. You see, there was --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- a rotation. I -- I don't know, I -- yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: How was -- what was your involvement in it? Was it that you were a group of other boys --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My involvement was pure, not charity. I was -- as I told you, I was immature, I didn't know what I was doing. I was very happy to do it. I had a great, not love, but I mean I liked the boys, I seem to remember some of them. So -- and -- but my function, what I actually did was simply to take them out with other friends.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Uh-huh. And so you would take them out --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: So I--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- for playing and for exercise?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- to -- yeah, yeah, and exercise and play ball, and that sort of thing and so on. But -- and then, you see that -- so, we had the Gestapo next door --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- right? And then, on the first floor, and then there was a roof, you see, on --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- on the top of the house, without any heating, with mattresses on the floor. And at times I saw with my own eyes there's something -- sometime 15 children and so on. A-And mostly -- most of them, if I am correct, I don't -- came from Poland and Vienna.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did you get -- did you have a common language that you --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I see, so you never --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, of course the -- they knew su -- I don't know -- know, really. Communication was rather poor in the sense -- because most of them had language problems, right, and actually the priest, after the -- after the -- I mean the liberation of the country, created si -- courses in -- in Hebrew for -- for the boys. And the most important part of my testimony as far as I'm concerned, that I believe, I don't know that, but -- I don't know how many, but certainly perhaps a thousand boys, over the years, you know, went through that system.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So there -- about -- over a thousand boys were -- went through the school, through this house</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, no, no, no --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- excuse me, this house that they were saving --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- they were -- they just were --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- they were sheltered there, they found a shelter. But you have to realize th-th-the that e- extraordinary, absolutely extraordinary to keep boys --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Next to the --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- and I never witness any -- you know, any lack of discipline or anything there. The boys, most of them were so conscious of their situation and -- and so disciplined and so on. But I want -- | wanted to say two things. The first thing is that as far as I know, only one boy who I changed his fate, you know, so [indecipherable] it was part of the system to protect the Jewish -- and also perhaps even more than the Jewish aspect, the -- the authority of the parents. And that was very beautiful, I never forgot that. Well, that's one thing, and the second thing again, as far as I know, not one boy was caught and so he saved them, really save --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: That was one of my questions, is the fate of these children, as far as you knew it, that these children did not fall into the hands of the Gestapo, who were right next --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They did not.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: They did not.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: For a day and night.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And in addition --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mmn-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- there was, of course, an enormous problem of feeding them. You see, every citizen received coupons or stamps and so on, and so we had to find food and nourishment for those boys. And -- and we ha -- had not only to prepare the meal, and then but al-also to feed them, and to avoid noises and so on. And quite frankly, I never understood how it was achieved, and sin -- and so on, because it --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Were any of your friends involved in this as well?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no, yeah, I-I myself only came, only on Sundays and Saturdays, so I -- I was not an outsider, but I was not involved in the actually daily routine of the -- of the shelter. And so i -- you have to -- also to understand that there was a network around that place, you see, providing food, nourishment and so on. There was an er -- a truly heroic nurse who was heading sort of an office -- sort of Red Cross offices, where the boys were treated and so on. Bu -- and all that was in -- achieving sec -- complete secrecy and so on. And that person, after having given herself to that work for three year -- three years, on the very last day, a few days before the liberation, she got -- she was killed in a bombing, and so on -- o-on the spot and her body was thrown on the wall [indecipherable]. And it was a truly -- I mean, extraordinary person, extra -- a nurse [indecipherable]  <span class="page-break" number="12"></span> </p></p></dialogue>

For -- for instance, if you had informed me that -- this interview, I would have gone to talk to people [indecipherable] but th --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: It's okay.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- no, it -- it's not important, no.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And if not it's -- it's --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, no, no.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- we can leave it by the side. Were there any of -- any other of your friends that you knew of, even if not directly, who in some way were involved in the sheltering?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes, of course, of course, there were a -- a number of -- why, as a matter of fact, I -- very recently I got in touch with a -- who is now al -- a priest also, but he was a boy at the time of those events, and he had known that Joseph Andre -- now the name comes --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: See?

<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="13"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: So I -- I was saying yes, I -- I know that yeah, tha -- h-he was a boy at the time and that priest came to his fath -- his parents had a little farm or something --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- and so they got supply, I mean the -- the shelter got supplies from them, and so --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Excuse me, can you repeat that? I didn't fully understand.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: You didn't understand, no? No, I just met recently --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Mmn-hm, mm-hm.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- the priest, who was younger than me, and when he was a child, his parents supplied potatoes and eggs and so on and so --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: To the school -- to the boys, mm-hm.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Bu-But the main -- th-the one who worked most with the -- the priest and myself, died recently.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes, yes, please.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: So, if you want, I-I could tell you how this extraordinary experience ended, so -- becau -- ah yes, I was telling you that the father of one of our boys was shot by the Gestapo on the street, and then, that moment I was called by phone, and I really risked my existence on that date, because of course the shelter, it was at the back of the house in -- in the cellar, down cellar --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- they had a door hidden by a piece of furniture and so on, and there -- so there was an escape on -- on another street.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="14"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You see, on the other side. And so all the boys escaped, and I took charge of a group of five or six, with the Gestapo [indecipherable] but I-I was not aware that -- I -- I was -- it was not an heroic action, it was just a purely human, but in fact, it was.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because -- and then the priest fled, disappeared. Hi-His brother was arrested, he was [indecipherable] and so on, and other people were -- are arrested, but none of the boys was captured.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did the Gestapo know that they were in the house, and they came looking for them?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Ah yes, I -- at that time, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: At that time, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And was that close to the end, or was th --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: It was close to the end of the war, yes, of course, and -- and then the boys were [indecipherable] and I went to a marvelous -- well, she was a nun with a very strong character and so on and she was in charge of an orphanage and so on. And so I took my boys to her and that was the end as far as I was concerned, just to -- but then after that -- if -- should I continue?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes, please, mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes, yes. So the priest fled, the boys were -- disappeared, none of them was captured, well -- and in September, I think, the -- the place, or the town was liberated by the US. first army. And then that was a beautiful memory I have because the Jewish chaplain of the American unit invited me and the priest for the celebration of the Jewish New Year. I forgot the exact date, but I don't know --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: In September.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="15"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was in September, but I don't recall whether it was the first and so on.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And after that I -- I joined the American first army as a volunteer. I-I didn't accomplish anything. But then we crossed the Rhine, I think April first at Remagen, and then we raced through Germany -- not me, but the --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- Patton, and so on, and -- and so finally we -- we arrived in the vicinity of Weimar.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right? And then I wa -- I visited, must have been I don't know how many days, let's say 10, after the liberation of the camp, of the -- Buchenwald.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And there -- if you want I could talk to you about that experience, and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yes, of course.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: What?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes, please.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Pll have more questions about the ci --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Why don't you ask them now?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No? Would you now?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay, then we can back up a little bit.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When you were talking about when the Gestapo started to hunt for these boys --  <span class="page-break" number="16"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- that were in the house, you mentioned that one boy had his -- had his father shot --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- close by. Can you tell us a little bit about those circumstances, and how is it the connection was established? How is it that the Gestapo knew that the father had a son there, or did they?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, because then we -- first of all, we knew, since the boy were -- a-as far as I recall, you say the fa -- the father of that boy was shot a few steps from the house, and so on. But you -- we knew that we were in danger, but how the alert was given, that I-I have no recollection of that. I just know that at a certain hour in the morning, I was called by a friend working with that priest and so on, that I had to come at once, and then I was put in charge of a group of boys.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Even more to step back, what were the circumstances of this man's -- how is it that he came to be there, that he was --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Who --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- the -- the father who was shot.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: 1 -- I don't know, I don't --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Oh, you don't know. You just kn --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I don't know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Oh, you don't know that. Okay, so --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I just know that this happened, and from that moment of course we were all in mortal danger because --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Because they could see the -- they could go and look for the boys.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- a-and the house must have been watch and so on, and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Mm-hm. When --</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="17"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: But it ended in a very sudden way, that all the boys fled through the -- that escape door on the other si -- on another street, you see, on the other side of the building, and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Mm-hm. Now, when you would go out and play with them on Saturdays and Sundays --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- what kind of activities did you undertake with them?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Normal, you know, boyish activities and so one, the --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: What's that?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Walking, first of all. They were happy to be out, which was not given, you know, very frequently. You must imagine what it is for a boy to be shut in a house and so on and then I suppose we played ball and that sort of thing. It lasted a -- the outing lasted about four hours or something of that sort.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Would it use --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: In the afternoon.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Uh-huh. Would it use -- was it in the town, was it in, let's say outside the town where -- did other people see you as you --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Of course, sure, sure.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: But they thought it was a church, normal church activity, you see, just --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I see, so did anybody ever look at these children and say they --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Of course.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- they don't look like our children?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no, as far as I know, no.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay, so there was never any --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="18"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: A-A-Anyway, I have no i-idea.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I see, I see. So your outings were not like in the woods where no one would see them, they were within the usual --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, no, no, no, I mean, it was totally open and so on.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was a normal parish activity, and -- but I -- as I say, tha-that priest was extremely sensitive to any proselyting and so on, and as far as I recall, those who -- the boys who had placed in that orphanage and so on, actually on Sundays [indecipherable] they went to church, but they were given instructions, you see to respect their own Jewish practices and liturgies. Although they physically participated, they were warned by that nun, or by the priests themselves, not to do anything. And that, I think is a very beautiful part of the story.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm. I would a -- how -- can you tell me in total how long, how many years were you involved with -- with -- with taking care of these boys in that house?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [indecipherable] that was very, very short, because he actually went into that house, you see, in 41.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And then I-I -- I'm not clear, I do not know the -- the actually links he had with Jewish organizations. I don't even know their name, but th-they were very active, for instance, they supplied food stamps, you see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And so I suppose that the boys came to that Jewish -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B  <span class="page-break" number="19"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- interview with Paul Peeters, conducted by Ina Navazelskis on Wednesday, December 22"4, 2004, in Washington, D.C.. This is tape number one, side B. So, Mr. Peeters, we were talking about the length of time that the boys were in the -- in the house, say -- you know, sheltered by the priest -- his name was Joseph Andre, was that the n -- his name, yes? And you were saying it began in 1941, and lasted until almost the end of German occupation in Belgium --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Sure.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- in 1944, is that correct?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: A-Actually, it was February 1944. That's when the incident we recall --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- took place.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: With the fa -- with the man being shot?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: I see. So the --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, that's my recollection, of course.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see. And so then, it was soon after that that -- that the liberation came?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In September.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In September, yes. Well [indecipherable] yes?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [indecipherable] the war lasted until May 8, 1945.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you were with the you -- the army, the United States Army?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, I was, in Weimar.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. So tell me a little bit more about when you went to Buchenwald.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And then, I don't know how, I don -- I forgot how it took place, why it -- but it was a very short period I told you, aba -- af-after the liberation of the camp. What I would like to supply,  <span class="page-break" number="20"></span> </p><p> because you know the -- the good Germans were asked to surrender their cameras and so on to the -- and so I got hold, I don't know how, of a -- a very small photo ca --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Of a -- of a photo camera?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah. And so I took pictures, and those pictures I will -- I have to look for them, but I would like to supply to you, because as far as I know, I'm the only one who took the picture bec -- well, that's a -- I -- I --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Tell us, tell us, mm-hm.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, I have to tell you the story, because --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Sure.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- the first thing I -- we were greeted, the camp of Buchenwald was governed by Yugoslav communists. And so those communists were totally in control of the camp when we -- we came.</p><p>And so when, I don't know how, I -- I won't call it a privilege, but yet it is something important for me. I was taken by a team of those com -- so it's a first experience --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: The for -- the communist -- former communist prisoners in the camp?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was first experience of communism, because th-there was such a contrast, you see, between those starving inmates and those, you know, powerful and -- Yugoslav communists. So anyway, I don't know -- I don't know how I managed, perhaps because I could still already speak some English, I don't know. But I got an extraordinary experience, because there -- the man who guided me [indecipherable] took me really at the -- at the center where they -- they were exterminated. It was a barrack, right, and there was a little yard with a gallows, is that what you call it, right? Where they could hang about 15 people at a time, that -- so the barrack -- the</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="21"></span> </p><p> barrack was here and then there was a doctor's office where the shot, you know, were given to the inmates, and then there was a -- it's horrible -- a place where the bodies were just piled, and so on, and then the cremation oven was nearby. So that man took me there, and of course that's something [indecipherable] terrible, I mean not -- although, I mean I'm more impressed by it now than I was when I [indecipherable] Jews with that, you know, immature mentality I had.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Why do you say that, why do you think it? Why was it immature?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Because I said -- I proved it, I said, that 1 am more moved now by what I experienced then, than I was at the time. But I -- and -- and you have to -- i-it was an extraordinary experience, this -- as far as I recall, that the oven were still used in the --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Even -- even then? After --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: E -- e -- a -- a -- th-that's if -- that the -- the memory I have, but I admit it might be wrong.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you still see -- were there still bodies when you went to see it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: ""m not sure about what my memory is. My feeling is that they were still used.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Perhaps to dispose of -- because the people were still dying, you know, and -- and the good American soldiers gave them chocolate and so on, which was -- it was totally uncontrolled at that time. When I-I -- when I visited the camp where the [indecipherable] was --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Was this in --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Because the American ri -- you know, rush -- you have no idea how fast it went. Patton, you know, made a -- a breakthrough at Remagen, and so on, and in a matter of days we traveled hundreds of miles, and so on. And so there was no, as far as I'm -- as I can say, no effective, probably, medical -- Americans are very, very nice, very kind and so on, but it was something</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="22"></span> </p><p> totally uncontrolled. And so the -- the in -- the prisoners died, scores of them died [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: How long were you there in that area? How long were you in this Weimer area?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I don't know [indecipherable] it was si -- oh yeah, and then I come to the point which I wanted to make.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: [indecipherable] I would be glad --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- because my children are simply -- know nothing about those things.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Mm-hm.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No, no. That's long gone.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: One of the box cameras, you know, very -- the cheapest of the cheap. But yet, that picture came out, and as far as I know, I hope I'll find it, but if I do find it, I -- I'll send it to you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [ll be very happy to do that -- to do so.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was it that you were numb? When you saw this -- you say you appreciate it more now than then.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Of course.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Many people were numb when they saw such things, they couldn't imagine --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- such horror.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: They were -- they were completely shocked.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So, was that something that -- also that -- that you could s --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I don't think I was shocked. First of all, because I could not -- you see, it took me years, so to speak, to realize the -- the vastness of this operation and so on. It's not that I was not moved and so on, I was very sensitive, but -- but I was a real -- that I could testify, a real attachment to the-- to the boys and admiration to the way, you know, they acted and so on. I remember a little Polish boy, I don't know how he did it, but he was reading phil-philosophical books, you know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>He was reading Rousseau and that sort of thing and yes --</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="24"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Do you --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And then --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm? Please?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But you have to know that that priest, Joseph Andre, after the war was asked to testify and so on and to go to Israel, the -- the state of Israel was established if I am correct, in "48 [indecipherable] is that what it is? So actually he went to -- to Israel, to Yad Vashem, you know, only in September 1967.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And that's whe-when he received that title, and planted a tree, and so on, and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: The Righteous.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The -- yeah, mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And actually Yad Vashem send me a couple of interviews and so on which I could send you - - to you. In French, unfortunately.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mmn-hm. That will be fine.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, yes, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So y -- a-and you said Yad Vashem sent you interviews --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- done with him, or --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I don't know, I -- that I could not tell, but the document will s -- will tell you.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="25"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Will answer your question, but I too -- Yad Vashem send me two or three articles on Joseph Andre, after he received that title and so on, then he was received a -- you kn -- in Jerusalem, I think.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you ever meet any of the boys again?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I -- that's another story which is very sad.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Because after that, in deg68, was the United Jewish Appeal had him come in America --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- and then there was a reunion of -- of the boys, it's funny, I don't know how they learned about the reunion and that I missed, and I -- and that I don't forgive myself.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Uh-huh. And did -- but did you --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: But perhaps you -- you may have a few names [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It's possible, it's possible. We can look in -- in our archives to see in Namur what kind of activities were going on.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh, oh yes</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So it's -- I -- I would --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So you would have names, yes?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, it's possible, it's possible. But you kept in touch with the priest after the war?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, tha-that's another mistake I made, why -- and actually it's only very recently, it's a few weeks ago, but I met that other priest who knew him.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And if you had told me that you wanted to make that -- this interview, I would have been able</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="26"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- to get more material, but -- but ac -- I-I -- what I never understood is that, you know, I -- how little Europeans, and the Belgians in particular did. Because, you know that priest? There's not even one article of biography on him, nothing, although he is known i-in America, and in Israel, of course.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: What do you ho --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: There was no -- no official -- no -- no responsible ska -- written -- carefully written biography of him.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What do you put that down to? Why?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Hm?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Why is that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't know, I don't know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You know, it's a European. Old Europe, I suppose. And that's why I -- I mean, I always dreamt of a -- you know, of Holocaust, you know, becoming a sort of light. But there is something missing, there is a missing link and so on, and -- of course you -- you gather material and so on, but it never became the light you see, and -- and there there is an enormous amount of work that should be done.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In Belgium?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, in here --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Here?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- in everything, in the world in general.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="27"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Could you explain a little bit more, because many people would say that that has happened already, that the Holocaust is being used as a -- as a -- as an example to teach others not to have it happen again.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: There I disagree with you because that's not enough. Because that sacrifice, you see, that should not -- no longer, no -- I mean to -- to make the aura, you know. Knowing is something very important.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Why that -- to transform that sacrifice of a whole nation into a -- a hope, a light. You will agree?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, of -- of course I agree. I agree.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Especially for the Jewish youth, and so on. And -- and there I see that there is work to do, but I'm too old to -- for doing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What do you think would be ne -- what do you think is still needed?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Three things. First of all, you have to connect right -- no, because for me, for me is -- is not at all -- is no longer -- is not something -- I'm not centering on the horror of the thing. I see that as a -- a-a-as a hope, I mean the -- and recently I got to understand much better the universality of the Jewish faith, if | may use that word. I don't whether I -- I hope I do not offend you, be-because the thing is that the root of western culture, although it's called Judeo-Christian, wi -- ba -- th-the first root is the -- the col -- the vocation of Israel, for instance, that Shema and so on, for me it's an -- wi -- although I'm a -- a ca -- believer Catholic [indecipherable] believer, there is -- for me it's absolutely fundamental. And I see it -- I would not say that in a Jewish way, but for me I-I see the origin of my own Catholic faith here, right in that extraordinary history of Israel and so on. No, wh-what I mean to say is that first of all there's still a tremendous amount of ignorance.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="28"></span> </p><p> Why -- I don't see why, in every Catholic school, or in every public school there should not be a -- some -- a booklet or something, a very short, well written, educative information on the Jewish customs and so on and on the basic Jewish beliefs and so on. It could be done at a very little expense. Why -- di -- that's one thing, and the second thing is that you know the west?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Now, we underwent a cultural revolution, wi -- and now the values, the traditional values, which we call Judean-Christian values are now deconstructed and so on. And there there is a tremendous work to do. I'm not negative, and I think that in that -- what I call that cultural revolution, wi -- there is something which could be transformed into a positive [indecipherable] the values of the western culture a-are changed. The change has been very negative and so on, but it -- it's also, you see, very -- 1-it could be transformed into a positive -- and there I see if the Jewish -- if there could be a common formulation. Not that the Jews really should -- to express that basic fundamental reality, the universality of the Jewish message and so on. But that should not be done, you know, by grade, or I don't know, or books and so on. It should be done -- it should come bottom up, you see? And that could be done. That -- that -- that could be done, because I'm sure that, first of all that there would be a communion of -- of the jewi -- because I am -- been a teacher all my life, you see and I'm oriented towards the -- the younger generation, I feel more at ease with -- but if that effort could come bottom up, wi -- through friendship, you know, networking. Of course, there is an intellectual work which has to be done. And that means educational work. But the reality should be friendship, should be personal counters, and start, you know, very low profile, not, you know, those big reunions. For instance, my daughter met David Rosen, Rabbi David Rosen, do you know him?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-mm, no.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="29"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, but anyway, he's a very outstanding person, but you know, now he's totally identified with those groups in [indecipherable] and go to Rome and so on, and you know they captured him and so on, and that aspect of personal encounter, friendship, mutual understanding, cooperation where cooperation is possible, that is what is lacking, in my judgment.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's number two.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Number two? [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: That's number two, you said there were three things?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, number one is to formulate, if possible -- first of all to understand why the structural framework of that deconstruction, which has now been established --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- and which threatens the basic Jewish faith and tradition and questions and so on, as they do for the Christian and so on. And so there is a commonality, because the origin of Christianity are Jewish, right?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's right, mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. And the basic -- my faith, the Catholic faith is based on the Bible, and -- which is Jewish experience. So, in other word, number one is understanding of the -- of the structure -- intellectual structure of a deconstruction wh-which si -- is contrary to the fundamental Jewish tradition which, insofar is it is common to the Christian origin. Right? Number two i-is, if possible, try to be more interactive, or more intelligent in spreading basic knowledge, even for kids and so on.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see, mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In schools, and so on, and of course at the upper level even more, of Judaism, right? And third is that fred -- friendship business.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="30"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The context.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: You know, [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: By internetworking, by --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did you -- here is an irony. Since we didn't speak much before the interview, I had very little information. But of the little that I had, our -- our, you know, contact who told us of you said that you hadn't spoken much about your experience during the war, that --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- okay. Did you tell your own children?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I'm sorry?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did you te -- did you tell your own children --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- did you tell your own family?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: [indecipherable] little, very little.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And is there a reason for that? Was that a conscious decision on your part?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, no, there was no reason, I was just --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did they know --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- too bashful to push myself forward, that's about it, though. You know, they know about it, and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Then --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Because in addition to that experience with the priest, you know, I always thought about --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="31"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- Iwas connected with a -- though that was a very deep friendship and so on, and also with my wife, of a French politician named Michelait I don't know whether you know his name.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No, his name is not known to me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Anyway, he saved many, many Jews and so on, and he was a gr -- a great friend of mine, and he became minister, he was a friend of de Gaulle. He went to Dachau and se -- and so on, but in Dachau he -- he worked -- I mean, he did not work, but his association was more with the communists inmates than with the -- the Jewish people. But he saved, for instance, many Jewish friends I -- I have who I met here in America, just -- so that experience is a little bit divided, but I was a -- I wa -- never reluctant to speak about it and so on, it's because my role, first of all, what I could do, except in that exceptional situation where I really risked my life for them, but I never thought I was doing much and so on. It's only after the war, after the business Buchenwald that I-I realized the magnitude of the -- of the Holocaust.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I read a little bit about the Holocaust in Belgium.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And comparatively to, let's say the Netherlands, there were in -- in the articles that I read, it was stated that more people were involved in hiding and saving Jews, that f-fewer Jews died. St- still many, many --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Mm. Yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: -- over half were killed, but the percentages were lower in -- in Belgium --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Really?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- than in the Netherlands.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Mm-hm.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="32"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And in some of the other surrounding countries and that there were a number of factors that contributed to that. Is that something that you found also to be --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, I am not aware of that at all, just --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- no. But Iam aware of the number of people who performed, you know, heroic action around that -- that system, that little system we -- I was a-associated with. I mean --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Was your family -- did your family know what you were doing?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no, no, not the family, not the -- none of the family. The people around , for instance, there -- you know, there was a -- a bakery and -- a bakery that supplied bread, you know, as a [indecipherable] and so on, and -- and that woman really was heroic, heroic. She was leaving [indecipherable] not very far from the center. And that sort of thing, a p-place to a-avoid the family, and so on.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They -- no, of course not.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay, so neither your parents, nor your brothers or your sisters --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, no, of course not.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="33"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And that was entirely an un -- individual decision and so on.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did you speak of --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: But I do not mean to say that -- no, I -- I was [indecipherable] or that sort of thing. I ju-just accepted -- I did not even consciously accepted the risk. I did it as a service for the -- the children, the boys we had, and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember their names, any of the names of the boys?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no, no.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: We actually never knew them, and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Bless you.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were there always different boys that were coming?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No -- oh yes. Yes, yes, but that was, I think -- I believed at the time that [indecipherable] it was some Jewish organization taking care of that circulation and moving the boys and so on.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And they were very effective, as proved, as I said, by the coupon -- or they probably printed them, or I don't know, stole them, or --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Mmn-hm.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: But we received whole sheets, you know, of -- of --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Of those ration tickets?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, the ration tickets.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="34"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can you tell me a little bit more, I wasn't very clear about the French connection, this man who you said was a minister under de Gaulle and had spent time in Dachau. Was your contact with him after the war, or during the war?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, it was mostly after the war, because during the war he actually was the mayor of this town in southern France, the middle of France, and he printed, you know, identification paper -- i-identity papers and so on, and -- and saved, actually saved them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mmn-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
